Use the [Github Actions Source](https://github.com/actions/runner) to generate a super smooth cross platform runner installation experience that can start an agent on a machine, then connect to a control chain.  It can then act as a pulse producer for different priotizations, like open market, your personal workloads, or allow control of some local resources.

Running an agent in a foreign private network would be done in this way.  It could run web servers for local clients to load from, and access private and permissioned databases onsite.

WebRTC means that we can have agents connected anywhere that all act like they are local.
