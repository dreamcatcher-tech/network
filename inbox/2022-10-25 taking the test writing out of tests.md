Came from tickets guy having a conversation with someone else and talking loudly while talking to meticulous.  Meticulous records sessions and tries to turn that into testing stories, and detecting regressions.

Recording sessions and playback is useful, but the problem is the amount of noise this recording generates.

Being able to summarize, and to auto generate stories based on what the customer is doing would be useful.

Show paths graphically, as tho the browser was moving thru its axis, then the place the users attention is focused shows as lines thru space as their attention flows.

Should detect stories that are looping

Each customer is their own dedicated story, unique to them, but testing should be able to combine many of them.

Help designers make sure the path is well trodden, rather than having many different paths.

Should be able to replay a user story, with modified UI.

Plan out your changes to the main flow.  Detect which users will likely feel the impact of your change, and see how they are reacting.  Generate guidance for those users when they get to their usual position - make them feel like you know them.

Feels like definitely an ML problem, provided the data is well structured.  Use this to turn the sites into components, and put those in the marketplace for improvement.  Come for the tools, stay for the labour market.

## Dreamcatcher Framework
We would be able to encode a users story as a series of covenant actions, which can be replayed.

Useful for us since we can determine the value of the different flow paths, and attribute back for it.  These 'desire lines' being generated based on customer usage mean that the incentives follow the heavy path of customers.
