Many businesses have need of accurate and up to date geocoding systems.
They should be able to generate and share their views.
Companies may need to share information between each other too, like the HRV company might need to know where the mains connects.

Further many companies are capable of automatically generating this data - a trucking company doing deliveries to addresses can report where they are parked each time they do a service.

## Privacy
Segment privacy based on things like:
1. Address to gps mapping
2. Access times - when the info was last generated ?
