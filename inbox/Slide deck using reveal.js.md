We need a slide deck on our website, and [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/#/30) can let us put this on our website.

Without too much fuss, we should be able to power it from our blockchain, so that edits are immediately visible, and slide content can be voted upon.  

Each slide should invite modifications, and also have a link to the contribution tree, showing how if anyone invests based on this deck, they would be due some attribution.

Investors want decks, and what better way to showcase our system than using it to generate the deck, present it, update it, and reward those contributors.
