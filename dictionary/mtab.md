A special channel maintained in [[AppRoot]]s that maps a friendly name to a remotely hosted chain.  Remote means is part of a different [[AppRoot]] and may have different validators from the current [[AppRoot]].

Copies its meaning from the [linux mtab file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mtab)

Required so that at boot, a hosting validator knows what network connections to make in order to properly maintain the [[App Complex]] it is hosting.
