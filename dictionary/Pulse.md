The unit of permanence in [[PulseChain]]s. Equivalent to blocks in a traditional blockchain.

The name "Block" was taken by IPFS to represent a piece of content addressable data, and so to avoid confusion and try to distance our solution from the ponzi scheme of cryptocurrency, a new name was chosen - Pulse.
