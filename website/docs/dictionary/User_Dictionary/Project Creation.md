The act of creating a new Project within the DCM.

There are two routes to creating a Project. The first is from within the Projects/ Object. The second is from within the Wishes/ Object, in which case the newly created Object has a Dream, linked back to the original Wish.

A newly created Project will initially be held inside the Project that created it, but can later be made Sovereign.
