Dreamcatcher records all interactions between Members on a blockchain, which is accessible to scrutinise by all Members.

In certain circumstances work and agreements need to be carried out off-chain.  Off-chain refers to any signed agreements that Members can present that have not been registered on the Dreamcatcher blockchain, but which nevertheless form an agreement between Members, and are therefore in-force, albeit with a lower standard of evidence.

Additionally, work can be carried out off-chain.  In such circumstances the DPL and any Modules and Contracts agreed are in force.  However, off-chain work may be harder to prove than those recorded on-chain.  

It's within the scope of the Arbiter to consider off-chain evidence as they deem reasonably applicable, whereas on-chain work and agreements are considered uninpeachable.
