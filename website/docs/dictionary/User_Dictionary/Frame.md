A Frame is a collection of Algos that can be used as a filter through which an Object can be viewed. It provides the ability to view an Object from another perspective. The use of Frames enables multi-view.

A Frame can e.g. be used to filter out all Comments from a certain Person, can apply different attributionAlgos to a Project to see what the hypothetical result would be, can alter the result of evidenceAlgos based on any criterior, such as disregarding or emphasizing certain Algos.

Frames can be published as Instance Projects, where the Parameters hold the Algos to be applied. Frames can also include other Frames, and therefore can be presented in layers.

Frames allow you to see an Object as others see it.

Frames can be combined to give a probability spread, and can be drilled into to see the derivations that are being used.

You can also derive conclusions from the use of a particular frame. It's a fingerprint, such that your choice of frame allows conclusions and groupings to be drawn - e.g. groups of objects/people who choose to view the world in the same way.
