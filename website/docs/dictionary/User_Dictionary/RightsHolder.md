The Member who currently is cited in the Attribution Algorithm for a Packet.  

The Do-er who creates a Packet automatically is assigned as the Rights Holder. 

The Rights Holder may change depending on the contents of a Dreamcatcher Contract, or through subsequent sale of those rights to another Member.

There may be more than one Rights Holder for a given Packet.  E.g. if a Funder paid a Do-er at 50% of rate, the Do-er and the Funder would hold 50% of the Rights for that Packet.  

Rights may be attached to a Dreamcatcher Contract that stipulates some restrictions, e.g. the benefit of revenue from a certain territory.
