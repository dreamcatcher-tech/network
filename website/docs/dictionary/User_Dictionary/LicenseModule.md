A stand-alone supplemental extension to the Core DPL which a Signatory may advertise that they are willing to be held by. A Module is in force only when Signatories both advertise it is available and agree that they will be bound by it, and that it is in force when conducting business together. E.g. an NDA Module may specify constraints on data usage; a Usage Module may specify constraints on the use of a Packet.

Module(s) are considered supplemental declarations to the DCL stack, and make up the appendix to the DPL, and are only in-force insofar as they can be combined with the DPL stack in question to create a single coherent legal document. Any module with clause(s) in breach of the core DPL and operating on the DCM will be considered unenforceable.
Contract

Refers to that part of the License Stack that contains unique parameters and clauses pertaining to a specific agreement for services or a Packet to be produced/worked on, on the DCM. When taken alongside any included Modules and the Core DPL, it forms part of a legal agreement, smart contract, or code which may be enforced through Corporate Law.
