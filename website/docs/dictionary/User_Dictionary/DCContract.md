An offer and acceptance, detailed on-chain, between two Users that details a transaction (e.g. work to be carried out, services to be rendered or assets to be transferred) DCM Contracts can only act as a supplemental declaration to the core DLP and cannot supersede any clause(s) contained within the Core DPL or amend the core DPL in part or whole.

DCM Contracts optionally can stipulate that a Module is in force for the purposes of this particular DCM Contract. DCM Contracts are considered supplemental declarations to the DCL stack, and make up the appendix to the DPL, and are only in-force insofar as they can be combined with the DPL to create a single coherent legal document. Any DCM Contract with clause(s) in breach of the core DPL and operating on the DCM will be considered void with prejudice.
