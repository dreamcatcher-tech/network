A Member or Members who are cited in the Atribution Algo for a Packet are deemed to be the sole beneficiaries of that Packet during a dispersal event.  This is termed 'Rights'.

Those Rights extend to the ability to sell part or the whole of the benefit of a Packet to another member.

Where there are multiple Members who are cited as Rights Holders in the Attribution Algo, the Governance of the Packet is used to ascertain what can and cannot be done with that Packet, e.g. when selling on Rights.
