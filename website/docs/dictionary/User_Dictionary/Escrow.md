Escrow refers to funds that are submitted to the DCM alongside a completed and QA'd Request or Idea.  Those funds are subject to be released to any Member who completes the work in the view of QA. 

Escrow funds are also available to Arbiters to release following Arbitration.

If no submissions to QA from a Do-er claiming that the Request or Idea is extant, the originator can withdraw the escrow funds at will.
