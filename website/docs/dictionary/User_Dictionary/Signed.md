The DPL, License Modules and Dreamcatcher Contracts are considered Signed by a Signatory when presented with signature blocks completed.

The highest level of evidence is when a Member commits these documents to the Dreamcatcher Blockchain.  This can either be through a scanned copy with physical signature, a key-hash signature.

Off-chain copies of these documents are are also permissable, where the Members interacting exchange these in any form.

The least level of Evidence that a Signatory can provide is self-certification of Identification through unilaterally posting a ‘signed’ copy of the DPL on-chain. It may be the case that other Signatories will only do business with those who have posted additional evidence, such as a third party Notary service, or document checking service.
