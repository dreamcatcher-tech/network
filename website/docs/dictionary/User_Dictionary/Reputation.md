The derived view of a Member's actions on the DCM, based on the immutable record. This includes the decisions of Artbiters that concern that Member, the comments of other Members about that Member and meta-data on the fact that a transaction or interaction has occurred between Members (noting that the details of the transaction or interaction may still be obfuscated.)

Reputation is available as a data source, but is disinterested in the filter that is applied to it.  That is, various views may be taken, but the raw facts are always avaliable.
