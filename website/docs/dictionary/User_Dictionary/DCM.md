(Short for “Dreamcatcher Machine”) The system provided by the sum of all Dreamcatcher instances which interact through the Dreamcatcher Protocol.

Note that Dreamcatcher Instances can be provided by anyone, at any time, by downloading and running the source. Therefore there is no centralised provider of the DCM.

However, the defining factor as to what incorporates the DCM is any of these instances that do and could interact, through the Dreamcatcher API, with other instances.
