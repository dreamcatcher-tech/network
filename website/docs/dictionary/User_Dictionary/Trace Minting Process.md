In order for Contributions (ie State Changes) to be combined into a Trace, there is a ‘minting process’. That process wraps one or more State Changes together into a Trace, and tokenises them. This allows that bundle to subsequently be sold (transfer of Governance), or rights be sold (alteration to Attribution) as a bundle.

The Trace Minting Process is an active step by the User who caused the State Changes in question. Once this operation is complete, the Trace appears in that User’s Bank.
