Automatic capital is the process by which investment type activities can occur, but those activities are software controlled to ensure no investment contract lass promises can be made between any members.

This allows a company structure similar to what is required to participate in traditional venture capital, but with none of the overheads assosciated with it. This structure is instant to spin up, and instant to halt.

Such a protocol is essential to enabling Ambient Attribution because without this, only investment grade structures would be possible to fund elements of the network required to make Ambient Attribution operational.

While the royalties promised to those who provided the pooled resources need not be from Ambient Attribution, it is less overhead to attach an Automatic Capital structure to Ambient Attribution future returns, than to continue to peg the future returns of participants on any group of active participants, as this means a secondary market cannot be formed for the NFAs used to track the work done.
