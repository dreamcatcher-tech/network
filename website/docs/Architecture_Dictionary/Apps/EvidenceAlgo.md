An Algo that returns a probability (0 to 1) that the Parameters of a Ghost can be verified as relating to the Asset the Ghost aims to represent. 

For example, an EvidenceAlgo may be used to authenticate a file through a hashing algorithm.  In this case the Parameter passed would be the Hash, and the Algo would contain the Hashing method.  Likewise, it could prove identification through public/private key authentication, or check an ID against a database.
