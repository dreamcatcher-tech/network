the language they use is similar to what we want to use. Sounds like race for decentralized launchpads is about to start

So if we treat polygen as a strawman dreamcatcher, the differences would be:

1. we seek deduplication between project components
2. equity is not token based, but NFT based where every contribution creates an NFT by simply doing it
3. all of the project data is stored on chain, no matter how big
4. projects can be forked like a github project
5. the whole system can be run completely offline or on premise and connected to any other running instances at whim
6. you can prepurchase products of projects that do not exist yet, by specifying what you want and committing to pay
