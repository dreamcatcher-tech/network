### Goal

<!-- What is the goal of dreamcatcher -->

To provide a provably fair economy producing open works of knowledge

### What, who and why

<!-- What does dream catcher do, who does it do it for and why do they want to do that? -->

The Dreamcatcher is a partially automated wisdom of the crowds solution to the funding problem of open works of knowledge.

It enables software developers to contribute in a way that assures them of fair reward for the work they do, without any overheads, middlement, or legalities. All they have to do is make useful code, and the proceeds of sales of that code will be fairly apportioned to them.

It gives consumers the tools to apportion their payments according to their version of fairness, given their awareness of the software supply chain, which contributes to a wisdom of the crowds type of value and attribution discovery. This gives consumers confidence that they are paying a fair price for their software, and allows early purchasers to be treated like investors, and benefit from future appreciating of the software.

It pressures consumers to pay, without using force, thru awareness of producer contributions and fellow consumer attributions. This allows consumers to signal their values, while giving developers a means of pressuring payment to occur in the absence of force.

All this with very low overhead, and completely opt in as the defaults apply unless otherwise specified.

This is transparent supply chain provenance applied to works of knowledge.

Roughly, the basic principles are:

1. we seek deduplication between project components
2. equity is not token based, but NFT based where every contribution creates an NFT by simply doing it
3. all of the project data is stored on chain, no matter how big
4. projects can be forked like a github project
5. the whole system can be run completely offline or on premise and connected to any other running instances at whim
6. you can prepurchase products of projects that do not exist yet, by specifying what you want and committing to pay
7. membership is pattern based, not voting based, making it a psychographic network
8. every transaction can include a vote for any state change in the known universe

### Alternatives

<!-- What is the best current and foreseeable future alternative for each need identified in 1 and what makes dc better than that alternative -->

We are unaware of any provenance systems that allow consumers of free software to apportion reward to that supply chain. Capitalism in general is not structured to allow downstream to apportion upstream which allows errors to compound instead of average, and so it lacks high fidelity error correction to align with consumer expectations on a per transaction basis.

We attribute the dearth of alternatives to the absence of a universal object platform.

### Red queen

<!-- What is the sustainable competitive advantage that allows dc to stay ahead ahead of the alternatives -->

The pursuit of fairness leads to a single network. Any alternative that finds how to be fairer than the dreamcatcher will be open, and we will simply merge with it. As competitors approach fair from being unfair, they will merge with us (or whoever the fairest currently is).

Making every transaction optionally contain rich voting information is the highest bandwidth and lowest latency connection possible to a consumer base. The system itself is designed to balance this information against producers and other consumers, and average out deviations to seek the limiting form of fairness.

The primary motive of the system is the highest possible rate of innovation. The whole system is about being the purest form of the Red Queen, which it seeks to do on the assumption that awareness leads to fairness, which leads to maximum global innovation.

### Components

<!-- What are the components of the system. How do they work and how do they interact -->

All the components require at a minimum [DOS - upon which all applications run](interblock/wp_dos) and [Interblock - the universal object protocol](interblock/wp_interblock) which provides the underlying protocol for DOS and therefore all Dreamcatcher interactions.

Other components with dependencies are (TODO):

1. Interblock
   1. DOS
      1. App Store
         1. Gitclone
         1. Inventors Notebook
         1. Agreemail
   1. Inversion currency NVN
   1. Universal Computing Surface
