An algorithm that makes a decision as to whether or not to accept a Pull Request.  The algorithm may have aspects that are automated, may refer to other Projects for voting rights, or may be connected to an external system (e.g. for generating events outside Dreamcatcher.)

GovernanceAlgos always return a “Yes/No” decision based on the logic within them, and may return supporting data or results.

GovernanceAlgos can be combined with a combinerAlgo..
