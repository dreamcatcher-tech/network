A Person or Project who contributes funds directly to a Project.  This contribution may carry conditions, e.g. being triggered only when the Project reaches certain Milestones. 

This is distinct from someone offering funding for completion of an issue.  An Investor is giving control of their funds to the Governance of the Project.  This is profoundly different in law to someone who pays to get some work done.
