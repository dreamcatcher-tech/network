Dreams are the founding ideas and aspirations behind a Project.  They can be created by Forking a Wish or an Issue into a Branch, embedded in a Project’s Dreams object.
Dreams are intended to steer Projects towards a clear outcome.  There can be any number of Dreams in a Project, including zero.


By the time a Dream is Forked into a Project, it is expected (but not required), that the Wish or Issue that it was Forked from had benefited from a number of Comments and Pull Requests to deduplicate and hone the idea, and from Upvotes and incoming Weak Links to indicate whether it is a useful idea.
