# Dreamcatcher Charter

1. The Dreamcatcher exists to optimise innovation.
1. To do so it aims to bring together talent and resources in a manner that avoids waste and benefits all.
1. The Dreamcatcher therefore optimises for:
   1. Effective use of Talent which aims to incentivise those with specific skills backed by reputation to work on projects in a permissionless manner, where they are certain of receiving attribution for their work.
   1. Effective deployment of capital which requires transparency and the accurate assessment and sharing of risk.
   1. Reuse of prior art which requires the permissionless right to use that prior art, and the fair attribution of the benefits to the originator.
   1. Sharing of data which requires transparency and deduplication, and attribution to the owner of that data.
   1. The Discovery of Demand which aims to allow future need to be matched with the means to realise it.

## The Qualities Required

We believe the necessity of the following qualities are self evident:

1. All initiatives shall be Open Source? (Layout suggestion - These might be grouped)
   1. Reuse of prior art requires the permissionless right to use that prior art, and the fair attribution of the benefits to the originator.
   1. Sharing of data requires transparency and deduplication, and attribution to the owner of that data. (see open source)
1. Shorten Innovation Cycle time
   1. Progress relies on innovation; increased speed of innovation increases progress. (this sounds very darwinian...do we mean shorter iteration cycle times?)
   1. Speed of Innovation is maximised by full use of talent, reuse of prior art and sharing data. (Short iteration cyle times?)
1. Maximise participation
   1. Full use of talent relies on maximal participation; this is achieved when all who can usefully contribute, do contribute, and are incentivised to do so.
1. Reuse of prior art requires the permissionless right to use that prior art, and the fair attribution of the benefits to the originator.
1. Sharing of data requires transparency and deduplication, and attribution to the owner of that data. (see open source)
1. All three (what are the three? Maybe we should list the (3) core tenets as 1,2, 3 with any additive explanation under them, see above) are maximised by fairness, when all involved are incentivised in proportion to the returns their individual contribution has generated, and are safeguarded from the unattributed exploitation of their work by others.

## The Prophecy: A Perfect Innovation Machine

From the Constitution comes the prophecy of the Dreamcatcher:

1. There exists a theoretical organisation of all resources under the control of intelligent agents that is maximally innovative.
1. It allows no duplication of ideas, or resources, and actively drives towards deduplication (doesn't it allow for versioning, upgrades, etc.? So I might not be able to dup an idea but I could version it with full attribution. (e.g. if I make someones’ code more efficient. Or even make changes to my own code others are using
1. Such an organization has access to almost all human knowledge in real time, and can represent it as a single hash.(what does this mean? Is this equivalent to hashing Wikipedia? What does hashing Wikipedia do for humanity?)
1. It has the intrinsic ability to self improve and therefore will inevitably tend towards maximal innovation.come into existence
1. It can trackrecognize all contributions atdown to an atomic level and can attributes rewards for useful work fairly. to them all
1. The attributions are final and irrevocable. Ownership rights are absolute, and provable.Are we saying that mutability of attribution can not be transfered? What if someone wants to sell their attribution? What if an investment firm would like to buy the attribution rights and bundle them in a financial product for guaranteed income?
1. It still cannot perfectly know the future, and expresses that uncertainty by providing a visible and transparent multi-view method which makes alternative views possible.but it expresses uncertainty as an arbitrary number of multiverses (duplication with worldview slant. Does this conflict with the no duplication in section (2)?
1. Given this inescapable uncertainty, which reduces over time, it aims to remove guesswork in attribution by moving the distribution of the benefits of work until the impact of contribution is certain. It has a perfect memory which is accessible to all
1. Any user can control who they interact with and who has visibility of their work.It is partitionable, where participants can isolate themselves from others
1. Its operation is distributed amongst all participants, each entirely self sovereign
1. It is structurally dynamic - rapidly recomposing in response to disaster
1. It is scam-proof.(this is a very bold legal claim that can not be verified)
1. All agreements freely entered and recorded on the DRM are executed without fail.(so even bad contract code will compile? Is this a use at your own risk clause? So if the contract later is shown to have an error then its “code is law” or is there a revert?
1. It recognizes risk given the information available at the point of decision
1. There are no barriers to collaboration beyond access to the DRM. It has the minimum possible barriers to collaboration between any members
1. Every participant can discover every other participant and their works
1. Can improve its own fundamental structure in a manner that is transparent and predictable - there are no Dictators.(is this the DAO?
1. Has within its structure the ability to allow the market to self-improve the algos that are part of that structure.Can improve the algos that runs on that structure.
1. It embodies self-righting stability.
1. Would replace the patent and copyright system(s) through automation and transparency.Would begin to replace the patent system as means of protecting IP
1. The Dreamcatcher aims to optimise the speed of Innovation.
   1. We think the speed of innovation is optimised through fairness and decreased iteration friction..
      1. Ownership rights are absolute, and provable.
      1. Interaction of individual sovereign rights, with tracking, encourages collaborationcross-pollination
   1. Others may have better ideas, so sovereignty is tracked and maintained, and attribution can be re-assessed as the system improves itself.

## Dreamcatcher v1 - The First Innovation Machine

From the Prophecy comes the first implementation of the Dreamcatcher Protocol:

The DCP provides a fair and level playing field for ideas to compete with each other.

- Through a socialized capitalism framework, tThe DCP aims to provide a platform for commerce that allows the different models available to be tested against each other in an open marketplace.

- We provide what we think is a fair algo, asserting that fairness is the most optimal way to interact, and complete fairness is maximally optimal.

It is a question for the emergent interaction of free agents on the DCP as to whether this assertion is true. The DCP provides that platform to test our assertion that complete fairness is maximally optimal, but is disinterested in whether that is so; it aims for maximal innovation, however that can be achieved.

We further break-down out first guess, that fairness is the most optimal way to interact, into the following:

1. Fair dealing. The greatest speed of innovation comes when the necessities of all involved are incentivised in proportion to the actual returns their individual contribution has generated.

This is in opposition to the current model, where the proceeds of work still to be done are divided up in advance, on a first come, most attributed basis.- typically in the form of share structures, share options and bonuses. This only incentives the first movers or ground floor agents and not necessarily the most valued contributors. This current model therefore forces those involved to answer an impossible question - what is the best way to divide up returns that have yet to be realised, from work that has yet to be completed, and where it is uncertain who carries out that work or adds most significantly to the aim of generating revenue? Given that it’s an impossible question to answer, it leads to significant waste of time and cost in negotiation, and is hampered by the differing information gradients - where the information available to two parties negotiating are so far apart as to be exploitable.

Compare that to this algorithm: where returns on the various contributions are calculated after the impact of those contributions are known. This is done by tracking the various types of contributions, including capital investment, advice and introductions, code produced. It allows contributors to reduce their upfront fee in return for a future share of the profits, which shares risk more evenly between investor and employee. It also does not limit the future exploitation of the work beyond the initial project,
real value of all those who contribute, , not on a perceived future return which is inherently unknowable.

1. Shared risk, shared reward - those contributing source code and effort are free to choose to work for less, and thereby invest in the codebase they are creating.

1. Visibility. The first step to making rational, data-driven decisions is to capture as much data as possible, making it visible to the decision makers. Therefore measure and track everything, to as great a precision and granularity as possible.

In order to support Fair Dealing, it’s necessary to have a single, high definition record that all involved trusts, and which can be used after the fact to see who’s contributions impacted the returns and by how much.

This tracking of data has a separate benefit - contributors do what can be inspected. By signing up to high visibility of your work, generally speaking, your work improves.

1. Trust and transparency. Inefficient markets are driven by an asymmetrical information gradient, information arbitrage where one party can exert an unearned multiple over another by having greater visibility of information over another. Therefore, for an efficient market to move towards optimum, transparency must be increased.

The ideal market is one where all transactions and data are available for all to see. This leads to greater trust - no more secrets.(this may be considered counterfactual since most blockchains Tx are transparent yet malicious actors still proliferate)

1. Sharing of data as an asset. Data compounds exponentially when added to other data. The maximally useful dataset is the set of all data that exists. Data must always therefore be shared. (is data sharing free by design?)

However, the person or organisation who generates data has rights over that data. It is an asset they own, can offer to others, and earn returns from. Data generated on a person by a third party is still owned by that person. Therefore the handling of that data needs to adhere to three concepts: legibility, agency and negotiability.

Legibility says you must be able to see and understand what your data is and what's happening to it, including what it's being used for.

Agency says you get to control what data is kept and what happens to it – not just opt-in and opt-out, but how it's collected and stored. You get to modify it, and what inferences you allow to be drawn. (so data is inherently mutable by design?)

Negotiability says you can see and control the social implications of your data use, and be able to get value from it.

1. Permissionless contribution. All who can contribute, and want to contribute, must be allowed to contribute. That contribution must be supported by Fair Dealing.

Talent does not depend on who you know, what your circumstances are, how lucky you've been at birth. Talent is talent. There is a legion of Leonardos who haven't had a chance to contribute because of chance. Such talent, and talent at all levels, should be free to contribute at their own risk, and, if that contribution is useful, benefit from it.

6. Permissionless investment. All who want to invest can provide a facility to draw down funds based on their own assessment of the risk, and the returns they believe are warranted.

Exclusivity is rarely beneficial, and is warped by information gradients. Investment should not be exclusive, but should be provided through market forces.

Investment is a return for risk taken, and that risk taken is a perception of the investor. Should an investor, through their own fact checking and diligence, feel content to offer better terms than an investor already in place, they should be free to offer that preferential investment. This activity also provides information about what the market believes are good ideas, and which are duds.

1. . Payment terms - get paid after the fact - only pay for something if it makes you money, and only as a fraction of what it made you - side effect is generating a large dataset of value created in different areas

1. Linking of assets to the real world. The greatest utility comes where every real world item, including the corporeal and incorporeal, has a mirror in the Dreamscape. This allows for the greatest fidelity in mapping the real world to the Dreamscape. The ideal is to mirror everything.

1. Opensource core. The platform itself is a commons, and must always be held in common. Paid for transparently, and in relation to returns, available to all to contribute and invest, available to all to use.

1. Contributions never die, they're built on. Returns from any contribution never expire, they continue to generate returns to the contributors for as long as they are useful. Moreover, contributions are always available for others to build on, and in this way continue to be useful. This building on the work of others must be recognised and upholded, so that progress is optimised.

1. Deduplication. The market in ideas is strengthened by deduplicating (merging?) and combining similar or identical ideas. The most efficient market in ideas is one where each is unique. Therefore ideas must be deduplicated freely, while honouring the contributions of all involved.

1. No risk for killing people because of bugs

1. Digital court to settle disputes on quality of work

1. Eliminate legal anything inside the network

1. All people are equal under these laws - no special cases or exceptions, for max predictability

1. Only induction is manual - all else is software defined - signup to the DPL should be the last dark ages signature you’ll ever need.

1. No power over users - this is a decentralized app, so we cannot kick anyone off the platform, but we can revoke their legal DPL license if they behave badly, just as the GPL does.

1. No votes from assertion - only votes by activity

1. Brand is sacrosanct in the Dreamcatcher - there can be only one brand

1. Members can leave and rejoin at any time - you always have control of your identity chain

1. Maximum reach out from network members to non network members - make it possible to trade with practically anyone. Probably the only people we would not make contracts with would be those that expressly prohibit trading with us.
1. Requests to alter the DPL or modify its clauses / get our members to sign up to derivatives need to be made public so we can possibly include something to cater to them ?
1. Committing to behave in DPL ways even with people not in the DPL
1. Recording of phone calls and all data while performing under the DPL is encouraged. (one party policy? Or do both parties have to agree in advance?)
1. Rules on plaigiarism from real ofworld to in. Inside the DRM closeness and novelty of ideas is managed by the attribution mechanism
1. Rules on closeness of brand and trademark, determined by a machine closeness
1. No member should be forced to share all their data with anybody, therefore a blockchain based distributed system is required to run on - no cloud, no central SaaS platform.
1. Data deletion - Users have the right to delete their data or opt out (by default) of data collection activities

## The properties of a suitable implementation of the Dreamcatcher

1. Compatible with the internet
1. Runs on a blockchain
1. Has no central server, and no central blockchain
1. Is censorship proof (resistant)
1. Allows perfect anonymity

## The Heart of the Dreamcatcher

Central to the Dreamcatcher is the Attribution Algorithm deployed by the Dreamcatcher itself. This is considered the current fairest known algorithm. Projects using this method of attribution are termed "Dreamcatcher Native". It is expected that this algorithm will be modular with different methods of calculation for different classes of work (such as project management vs marketing vs coding). It will balance current contributions with past historical contributions that have since been overtaken, will be cheap to compute, and may be statistically generated from in practice operation. Interestingly, this task includes within it the means for payment for its construction, and we expect this to be the most valuable NFA of the whole system.
