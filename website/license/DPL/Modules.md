# Modules

Modules may be created by any User and offered to any other User to extend the Core DPL. They are intended to allow a low-friction way to add additional rights and responsibilities as part of a DCM Contract, but do not in any way supersede the Core DPL. Modules can only be referred to from a DCM Contract and do not have any force beyond that.

In order to do so, any Module which is to be consistent and therefore applicable with the Core DPL must include a number of clauses which aim to hook the Module to the Core DPL and to the DCM Contract of which it’s a part. These are shown under mandatory clauses below.

In addition to these administrative clauses, there are Payload clauses which bring into effect the rights and responsibilities intended.

Modules may refer to parameters which are stipulated in the DCM Contract of which it is a part. Modules should not ‘hard bake’ parameters which otherwise could be defined in the DCM Contract, and if they do so may be challenged.

Below is an example, with Mandatory Clauses denoting the clauses that all Modules that can be used as part of the License Stack with the Core DPL must have, and Payload Clauses being the free-text area defining the intent of the Module.

The distinction between a Module and a Contract is one of re-use. The Contract holds clauses and data that is unique to this particular situation. Should a Contract hold Clauses that may be useful to others, those Clauses can be published as a Module.
