## Precedence

This Agreement forms part of a [license stack], the combination of which the Signatories agree to be held to while transacting through the Dreamcatcher.

This [license stack] is formed as follows:

1. Dreamcatcher Public License (this Agreement)
1. Optionally, License Modules, referenced in a Dreamcatcher Contract
1. A Dreamcatcher Contract

The precedence of Clauses within these three are in this order.  I.e. DPL first, License Modules then Dreamcatcher Contract. 

In order to be in force, each item in the stack must be signed by all signatories.

## Signatories

Any Dreamcatcher Contract that references this Agreement includes all clauses in this Agreement, and is bound by the signatories of both the Members' List within the Dreamcatcher and any executed paper/pdf copy.

## Terms

### Parties to the Dreamcatcher Public License

By using the Dreamcatcher Machine ([DCM]), all [Members] agree to be held by the [Dreamcatcher Public License] (DPL). 

[Members] agree that the [DPL] is a Legal Agreement between them and all other [Members] with whom they interact/transact, who in turn also agree to by held by the provisions of the [DPL].

In addition, [Members] may also Sign and/or exchange an [Off Chain] copy of the [DPL], [License Modules] and [Dreamcatcher Contract].  On presentation of these, the same [Rights] and responsibilites apply as if the [DPL] were [Signed] and [On chain].

### Scope of the DPL

The [DPL] applies to all interactions of any sort between [Signatories] conducted at least in part on the [DCM].

### Extension Through License Modules

The [DPL] may be extended by the addition of [License Modules].  License Modules are in force between [Signatories] only when listed in a [Dreamcatcher Contract] and apply only to that contract. If any clause in a [License Module] contradicts any clause in the [DPL], the DPL takes precedence.

### Extension through Dreamcatcher Contracts

[Dreamcatcher Contracts] are agreed directly between [Signatories] and are used to specify the parameters of an agreement.  [Dreamcatcher Contracts] cannot be used to revoke any part of the [DPL] or any [License Module].

### Jurisdiction

Jurisdiction of any breach between parties of the [DPL] and/or [License Modules] will be resolved through [Arbitration] and may result in the removal of [Member] [Rights]. 

[Arbitration] will consider the contents of the [Dreamcatcher Contract] to be the sole source of the agreement between [Members], optionally referencing [License Modules] and any additional terms, and being subject to the [DPL].

### Agreement to Arbitration

Counterparties agree that disputes within the scope of the [DCM] will be put to an [Arbitration] service within the [DCM], and agree to be held by the decision of that [Arbitration]. If no [Arbitration] Service is agreed between the [Signatories] within a [Dreamcatcher Contract], the [DCM] will appoint an [Arbiter] based on an automated process that is open to scrutiny within the [DCM] code.

The [Arbiter] has the right to judge the merits of any dispute and release or withhold funds held in [Escrow] between the two Signatories.

In all [Arbitrations], the claimant and the respondent agree that there can be no renegotiation of the ruling after the fact.


Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this [license stack], the use or misuse of the [DCM] or the breach thereof, shall be settled by binding [Arbitration] administered in accordance to the structure specified by the [DCM]. The place of [Arbitration] shall be within the [DCM] and all applicable [DCM] jurisprudence as defined by the current version of the [DCM] code base, which is available for scrutiny. 

### Open Pursuance

Possible breaches of the [License Stack] may be pursued by any other [Signatory] on behalf of a [Memberx] without permission. 

### Escrow

Counterparites may agree that all payments be held in [Escrow] at point of commission and released through Acceptance, as judged by the [QA] Authority specified in the [Dreamcatcher Contract]. In such cases, all parties concede to the automation of the [Escrow] service through the [DCM] and the decision of the [QA].

Should a dispute arise and funds are still held in [Escrow], the appointed [Arbiter] as specified in the [Dreamcathcer Contract] (or appointed by the [DCM] if none are appointed, has the right to release those funds as part of their decision.

### Primacy of on-chain data

[Signatories] agree that [on chain] data is immutable and is the only source of evidence that can be considered by [Arbiters] and [QA]. Moreover, the evidence [on chain] as to which events occured before other events is considered the true order of events.

### Right to be forgotten

A [Member] has the right to expunge their own data at any time. In doing so, the link to that data is removed.  This process anonymises this data while keeping the record of the activity and [Packets] intact. Subsequent attempts to link a [Member] back with this data with near or identical mapping to the original [Member] will be flagged and available for other [Signatories] and [Members] to view.

[Packets] generated and owned by a [Signatory] can be used by other [Members], with their permission, in aggregate or standalone, but only with the express permission of the subjects of that data, or anonymised.

### Deletion (Expungement) of Member Data

If you choose to expunge your [Member] Data, all [attribution] and [contribution] [Rights] are null. Right to be Forgotten is considered to be equal to the deletion of your [Member] Data.

### Free Speech

Any Signatory can publicly comment on the activities or validity of any other [Signatory] without fear of libel. Such comments are noted within the [Member] Data of both [Signatories], and is admissible to an [Arbiter].


### Reputation

All Public transactions and interactions carried out on the DCM are recorded immutably, and are available to view by all other Users.


### Persistence

A [Signatory]’s responsibilities to the [DPL] and [Dreamcatcher Contracts] agreed to on the [DCM] persists in perpetuity, and does not depend on the [Signatory]’s continued interaction on the [DCM].

### Intellectual Property Rights

Ownership of Intellectual Property Rights resides with the [Member] who originally committed it to chain (the original [Rights Holder]). Where identical data and IP are [on chain], ownership lies with the [Member] who recorded that work earliest.

Licensing Rights for [Packets] are asserted in the [Packet] Object, and can be any license that the [Governance] of that Packet chooses to assert. E.g. If open source, the [Governance] may assert AGPL v3; if closed source, the [Governance] may assert “All rights Reserved”, and so forth.

The [Rights Holder] of data or IP is free to sell or lease the [Rights] or partial [Rights] to the [Attribution] from that data or IP as they see fit, but this is only enforceable through the [DCM] if that assignation is recorded [on chain]. The [Buyer] is considered the new [Rights Holder].

Where data is aggregated, or [Packets] are combined to form new [Packets], the [Rights] of the [Rights Holder] persist in the form of [Attribution].

[Rights] cannot be sold, assigned, bundled, licensed, rented or distributed, either for direct or indirect commercial advantage, without permission of the [Rights Holder] through the [DCM].

Where a [Rights Holder] has given access and permissions on the [DCM], the Usage Module advertised by the [Rights Holder] is in force. This may include the right to fork, merge and distribute. 

The distribution rights conveyed to the consumer of a Packet does not imply the right to make further copies for resale unless stated by the [Rights Holder].

[Buyer] of a [Packet] cannot lend or rent that [Packet] to third parties without permission from the [Rights Holder].

### Agreement to Attribution

[Members] agree to be held to the [Dreamcatcher Contract] for [Attribution] under which their [Contribution] was generated. In the case of volunteers where no [Dreamcatcher Contract] for [Attribution] is in place, and in the case of collaborators wishing to defer stating a [Dreamcatcher Contract] for [Attribution], then any benefit from the [Contributions] are held in [Escrow] until such a [Dreamcatcher Contract] is agreed, or referred to [Arbitration].

### Agreement to Mediation

In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to a [License Stack], or a breach thereof, the parties hereto shall first attempt to settle the dispute by mediation, administered by an [Arbiter] through the [DCM]. There will be no final decision or ruling. Any decision rendered may not be binding. The [Arbiter] role is to supervise and help the parties come to a mutual agreement on their own. If the parties do come to an agreement and make it binding then the matter will be settled there and the [Arbitrator] then has the authority to release any [Packets] and/or [Escrow] funds agreed in the [Dreamcatcher Contract] in dispute.

### Damages

Representation or Warranty Claims are beyond the scope of the [DPL], other than those imposed through [Arbitration], which are:

1. Recording [on chain] of the facts and judgement of the [Arbitration] involving either party.
2. Releasing funds held in [escrow].
3. Transfer of [Rights] to disputed [Packets]

### Reputation


Data generated by the activity of a [Member] provides an indelible record and may be available for other [Members] to view. Such data is not owned by the [Member] and may be freely shared once anonymised under the Right to be Forgotten clause.  A collation of this information for a [Member] is known as [Reputation].


An [Arbiter] in a dispute may record their own notes [on chain] of both parties in the dispute. Such notes are not editable by the [Members] concerned, although entries may be challenged and added to (but not amended) by reference to a different [Arbiter].

Any [Member], including the Member to whom the [Reputation] applies, may record their own annotations.

### Revocation of Access to Packets

Any [Packet] that has been made public through the Access Control List [ACL] can never be removed from the [DCM]. A [Packet] that has been limited through an [ACL] to a defined list of [Signatories] may be removed. In this case, the [Signatories] who previously have had access to the [Packet], when notified or automated through the [DCM], will no longer have legal access to that [Packet].
