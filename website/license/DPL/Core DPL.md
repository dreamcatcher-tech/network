## Precedence

This Agreement forms part of a 'license stack', the combination of which the Signatories agree to be held to while transacting through the Dreamcatcher.

This 'license stack' is formed as follows:

1. Dreamcatcher Public License (this Agreement)
1. Optionally, Modules, referenced in a Dreamcatcher Contract
1. A Dreamcatcher Contract

The precedence of Clauses within these three are in this order.  I.e. DPL first, Modules then Contract. 

In order to be in force, each item in the stack must be signed by all signatories.


## Signatories

The list of all Members who have signed and are bound by this DPL Agreement can be found (here)[].

Any Dreamcatcher Contract that references this Agreement includes all clauses in this Agreement, and is bound by the signatories of that Contract.

### Open Source

Cf [AGPL v3]

### Signatory

Any User who states within the DCM, by way of key hash -signature, and/or uploading a copy of a physically signed version of this DPL, a Module or a DCC, that they agree to be held by the terms of the License Stack.

### Trace

C/f The Dictionary, Trace.

### Public

Descriptive of an Object within the DCM where the ACL states that there are no restrictions on Read-Access. Public Objects are available for all to see.
Access Control

A function of the DCM, Access Control states the conditions under which an Object (c/f Dictionary) on the DCM is accessible to Users other than the User who holds the key hash that proves ownership of that Object.. Once stated, Access Control is enforced by the DCM.

### Reputation Ledger

C/f The Dictionary, [Reputation Ledger]

### Rights Holder

The User who is the current beneficiary of some or all of the Attribution from a Trace. Rights may be attached to a DCM Contract that stipulates some restrictions, e.g. the benefit of revenue from a certain territory.

### Signed

The DPL, Modules and DCC are considered Signed when a User commits to their Dreamcatcher Ghost Blockchain evidence that they are willing to be bound by it. This evidence may be a scanned copy with physical signature or a key-hash signature.

Signed = physical signed copy, scanned, uploaded to the Evidence Object of the Ghost that represents the LDE, which by definition can only be done by the holder of the Private key for that Ghost.

The least level of Evidence that a Signatory can provide is self-certification of Identification through unilaterally posting a ‘signed’ copy of the DPL on-chain. It may be the case that other Signatories will only do business with those who have posted additional evidence, such as a third party Notary service, or document checking service.

## Terms

### Parties to the Core DPL

The Core DPL is in force between any and all Users of the DCM.[2] The Core DPL may also be Signed by a User.

Users agree that the Core DPL is a Contract between them and all other Users with whom they interact/transact.

### Scope of the Core DPL

The Core DPL applies to all interactions of any sort between Signatories conducted at least in part on the DCM.
Extension Through Modules

The Core DPL may be extended by the addition of legal modules which are agreed to be in force between two Signatories. If any clause in a module contradicts any clause in the Core DPL, the Core DPL has precedence.

### Extension through DCM Contracts

DCM Contracts which are recorded within the DCM and which are agreed between Signatories can be used to specify the parameters of an agreement, but cannot be used to revoke any part of the Core DPL or any Module which is agreed to be in force.

### Jurisdiction

Jurisdiction of any breach between parties of the DPL will be resolved within the DPL.

### Agreement to Arbitration

Counterparties agree that disputes within the scope of the DCM will be put to an Arbitration service within the DCM, and agree to be held by the decision of that Arbitration. If no Arbitration Service is agreed between the Signatories in advance, the DCM will appoint an Arbiter based on an automated process that is open to scrutiny within the DCM code..

The Arbiter has the right to judge the merits of any dispute, and has available all funds held in escrow between the two Signatories.

In all Arbitrations, the claimant and the respondent agree that there can be no renegotiation of the ruling after the fact.

Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this license, the use or misuse of the DCM or the breach thereof, shall be settled by binding Arbitration administered in accordance to the structure specified by the DCM. The place of Arbitration shall be within the DCM and all applicable DCM jurisprudence and, when necessary, applicable previous case law shall apply. Judgment on the award rendered by the Arbitrator shall be entered into the Reputation ledger of all parties involved.

### Open Pursuance

Possible breaches of the License Stack may be pursued by any other Signatory on behalf of another without permission. The terms involved are left to agreement through DCM Contract between the two.

### Escrow

Counterparites may agree that all payments be held in Escrow at point of commission and released through Acceptance. In such cases, all parties concede to the automation of the Escrow service through the DCM.

Should a dispute arise and funds are still held in Escrow, the appointed Arbiter has the right to release those funds as part of their decision.

### Primacy of on-chain data

Signatories agree that on-chain data is immutable and is the only source of evidence that can be considered by Arbiters. Moreover, the evidence on-chain as to which events occured before other events is considered the true order of events.

### Right to be forgotten

A User has the right to expunge their own Ghost data at any time. In doing so, the link to that User’s Ghost is removed, anonymising this data, but the record of the activity and Assets is kept. Subsequent attempts to recreate a new Ghost with near or identical mapping to the original User may be flagged for other Signatories to view.

Data assets generated and owned by a Signatory can be used by others, with their permission, in aggregate or standalone, but only with the express permission of the subjects of that data, or anonymised.

### Deletion (Expungement) of Ghost

If you choose to expunge your Ghost, all attribution and contribution rights are null[9]. Right to be Forgotten is considered to be equal to the deletion of your Ghost.[10]

### Free Speech

Any Signatory can publicly comment on the activities or validity of any other Signatory without fear of libel. Such comments are noted within the Ghost of both Signatories, and is admissible to an Arbiter.
Reputation
All Public transactions and interactions carried out on the DCM are recorded immutably on that User’s Reputation Ledger, and are available to view by all other Users.

### Persistence

A Signatory’s responsibilities to the DPL and DCM Contracts agreed to on the DCM persists in perpetuity, and does not depend on the Signatory’s continued interaction on the DCM.

### Intellectual Property Rights

Ownership of data and IP resides with the User who originally committed it to chain (the original Rights Holder). Where identical data and IP are on-chain, ownership lies with the User who recorded that work earliest.

Licensing Rights for Assets are asserted in the Asset Object, and can be any license that the Governance of that Object chooses to assert. E.g. If open source, the Owner may assert AGPL v3, if closed source, the Owner may assert “All rights Reserved”, and so forth.

The Rights Holder of data or IP is free to sell or lease the rights or partial rights to the Attribution from that data or IP as they see fit, but this is only enforceable through the DCM if that assignation is recorded on-chain. The purchaser is considered the new Rights Holder.

Where data is aggregated, or Assets are combined to form new Assets, the rights of the Rights Holder persist in the form of Attribution.

Rights cannot be sold, assigned, bundled, licensed, rented or distributed, either for direct or indirect commercial advantage, without permission of the Rights Holder through the DCM.

Where a Rights Holder has given access and permissions on the DCM, the Usage Module advertised by the Rights Holder is in force. This may include the right to fork, merge and distribute. Senario: What happens when someone gives away code as public open source but someone else uses that code for porift?

The distribution rights conveyed to the consumer of an Asset does not imply the right to make further copies for resale unless stated by the Rights Holder.

Consumer of an Asset cannot lend or rent that Asset to third parties without permission from the Owner.

### Agreement to Attribution

Users agree to be held to the DCM Contract for Attribution under which their Contribution was generated. In the case of volunteers where no DCM Contract for Attribution is in place, and in the case of collaborators wishing to defer stating a DCM Contract for Attribution, then any benefit from the Contributions are held in Escrow until such a Contract is agreed, or referred to Arbitration.

### Agreement to Mediation

In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this agreement, or a breach thereof, the parties hereto shall first attempt to settle the dispute by mediation, administered by an Arbiter through the DCM. There will be no final decision or ruling. Any decision rendered may not be binding. The Arbiter role is to supervise and help the parties come to a mutual agreement on their own. If the parties do come to an agreement and make it binding then the matter will be settled there and the Arbitrator then has the authority to release any Assets, Escrow funds, or Reputation Ledger modifications the parties agreed upon.

### Damages

Representation or Warranty Claims are beyond the scope of the DPL, other than those imposed through Arbitration, which are:

1. Recording on the Reputation Ledger of either party.
2. Releasing funds held in escrow.
3. Transfer of disputed Assets

### Reputation

Data generated by the activity of a User provides an indelible record and may be available for other Users to view. Such data is not owned by the User and may be freely shared once anonymised under the Right to be Forgotten clause.

An Arbiter in a dispute may record their own notes on the Reputation Ledger of both the Plaintiff and Defendant. Such notes are not editable by the Users concerned, although entries may be challenged by reference to a different Arbiter.

Any User, including the User to whom the Reputation applies, may record their own annotations against their Reputation Ledger.
Revocation of Access to Assets

Any Asset that has been made public through the ACL can never be removed from the DCM. An Asset that has been limited through an ACL to a defined list of Signatories may be removed. In this case, the Signatories who previously have had access to the Asset, when notified or automated through the DCM, will no longer have legal access to that Asset.

### Revocation of Access to Assets

Any Asset that has been made public through the ACL can never be removed from the DCM. An Asset that has been limited through an ACL to a defined list of Signatories may be removed. In this case, the Signatories who previously have had access to the Asset, when notified or automated through the DCM, will no longer have legal access to that Asset.
