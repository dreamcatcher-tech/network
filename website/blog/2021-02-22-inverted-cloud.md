"AMD Silicon" covers wide range too:

1. circuit designers
1. silicon fab
1. supply chain

Our applications must be easily portable to this mode of operation

Need to move to open silicon, with trusted fabs

If cloud@home then the workload is rapidly relocatable, and so the customer may choose to run some base load on prem, have other load on cloud@home, and sell their spare capacity on cloud@home

cloud@home makes use of idle resources, and shares yours out too. you can have enough resiliency for standalone operation in a disaster, but can rent this capacity out when not in use

So your chain of trust can now be as short as "AMD silicon", Which paves the way for cloud at home type scenarios where renting off a home supplier has the same security guarantees as renting off a cloud supplier

event driven workloads designed for distributed storage - so the workloads would have to be designed specifically for cloud@home unless its just small little apps
