title: 'Packet Switched Invention Networks'
---

There is an analogy to be drawn between packet switched networks, circuit switched networks, and dedicated lines and the progression of innovation networks.

https://www.livinginternet.com/i/iw_packet_inv.htm#:~:text=The%20packet%20switching%20concept%20was,world's%20first%20packet%20switching%20network.

Packet switching on networks has two major disadvantages:

1. Discontinuity
1. Conversions - always on dedicated innovation need to be formal and convert to a standard form, nor be checksummed by QA before being executed on.

Checksumming is performed by QA

The network is the innovator

Model innovation as a series of information circuits with unreliable operation, delays, lost packets, differing costs. Show how multihop can break a packet down and transport by alternate route, then reassemble.
