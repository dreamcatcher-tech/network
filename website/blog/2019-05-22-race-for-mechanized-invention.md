Why the panic to create an invention machine ? One of the founders of Dreamcatcher Inc describes the burden carried by all those who know how to let the genie out of the bottle, and the consequences of delayed release.

5/22/19, 14:13 - ü¶Ñ: What about all the people dying around the world because of cures not yet invented? Is it our fault, if it makes a cure, and say 10 people died in the previous 3 months, and we're like "remember that three months we fucked around for?"

5/22/19, 14:15 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: Shit that‚Äôs a good point.

5/22/19, 14:15 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: Zero tolerance of delay.

5/22/19, 14:20 - ü¶Ñ: Fuck man. Is that an unreasonable burden to put on us?

5/22/19, 14:20 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: Erm, no...

5/22/19, 14:21 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: Unless you fancy quitting ü§£

5/22/19, 14:21 - ü¶Ñ: Just cuz we know what it is, now it's our burden to make it?

5/22/19, 14:21 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: Yes, precisely

5/22/19, 14:23 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: So cast your mind forward until you‚Äôre 80 years old. Starting to lose it but not yet. Pissing yourself occasionally. Multiple things fucking up your body. Guys born 30 years, 40 years after you now calling the shots. Then ask what you want to do with the time between then and now. How to get those guys harnessing all of those kick-ass concepts that are lost to the wind...

5/22/19, 14:24 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: Or leave it to them and hope someone else comes up with an Invention Machine...

5/22/19, 14:24 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: Never know, maybe someone will

5/22/19, 14:24 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: My guess is they won‚Äôt

5/22/19, 14:25 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: Because they‚Äôll still be stuck by the stuff we‚Äôre trying to unstick

5/22/19, 14:26 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: So what, we have maybe 40 years useful left. 8800 days of work. About 70,000 hours

5/22/19, 14:27 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: And there goes another 4 from the time we called \*\*\* this morning

5/22/19, 14:27 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: Tick tock motherfucker‚Ä¶

5/22/19, 14:28 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: Then game over

5/22/19, 14:28 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: So, given all that. How long should we fuck around with the likes of \*\*\*?

5/22/19, 14:28 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: A year so far. Or about 2000 of those hours...

5/22/19, 14:29 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: It‚Äôs taken about 35,000 hours just to get to this point...

5/22/19, 14:29 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: One third gone

5/22/19, 14:30 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: Two thirds left

5/22/19, 14:32 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: ‚ÄúDespite this success, more than 3 million people die from vaccine-preventable diseases each year. Approximately 1.5 million of these deaths are in children less than 5 years old‚Äù

5/22/19, 14:33 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: So say there‚Äôs an invention the Invention Machine will find that stops 0.1% of that.

5/22/19, 14:34 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: Three months delay isn‚Äôt 10 people. It‚Äôs 750...

5/22/19, 14:35 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: And fucking around with \*\*\* is 3000...

5/22/19, 14:36 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: There‚Äôs huge value in getting something done by painting a vision. We can‚Äôt do this all the way just the two of us, but we can define the story others rally around

5/22/19, 14:38 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: ‚ÄúJust cuz we know what it is, now it's our burden to make it?‚Äù Yes, it is. Bring it on!

![3000 people](2019-05-22-assets/3000-people.png)

This is what 3000 people look like...

5/22/19, 14:41 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: Bear in mind you‚Äôre talking to the guy who thought he was about to kill 45,000 in 30 days at a 95% assurance of 70% probability in order to save 60,000,000...

5/22/19, 14:45 - ‚ò¢Ô∏è: So, sense of urgency? Hell yes
