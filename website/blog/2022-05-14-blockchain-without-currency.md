The destiny of blockchain is to model the entire world. What point then is any instrinsic currency ?

Object oriented programming is the dominant form of computer modelling.

Our purpose is to facilitate trade between all currencies and all objects, predominantly labour, technology, customers, and assets.

With enough granularity and autonomous agents, we can get back to barter.

When we first started towards the Dreamcatcher, we wanted software defined companies, to cure the ailments we had in our current publicly listed companies. Now we're saying that each object comes with a software defined company attached via API.

Why aren't software defined companies popular ? What are manually operated companies the favourite ? Is there some relationship between the granularity of a thing before it becomes programmable ?

Points

1. Future of all currencies is to be replaced with barter
1. Any crypto currency is arbitrary anyway
1. Object models allow direct trading of the item
1. We can model any currency, with provenance, and fractionalize it to nano portions
1. miners can earn whatever currency they wish
1. liquid exchanges let you swap for any other currency
1. There is no currency since the value we are creating is captured in the NFTs that make up the system

Given that we built this whole thing on non-fungibility and modelling of the real world, it makes no sense to have a currency of our own.
Any arbitrary fungible unit of value that has no internal control mechanism will periodically crash.
With no regulation, this cycle is accelerated, as the system can be used as a 'bigger fool' scheme, but is harder to squash due to its distributed nature, with a multitude of bad actors having no coordination except the same pattern of ill intent.

Systems that launch with a 'shares' like nature, such as ICOs and other "Initial \*" offerings bake in their demise from inception by setting the exectations and incentives of multiple powerful actors in the system.

There is no need for a currency inside the Dreamcatcher.  The Dreamcatcher is an object model that can capture any object in the world, both real and imaginary.  This is all that is required for trade.  We can model a unit of USD as an object and then allow it to be transacted in a programmable way.  There is no need to attempt to put an intrinsic value inside our network - we derive our value from being the interaction choice for all other objects, of which other blockchain networks are but a small subset.

## Intrinsic Currency Generation

The utility of an intrinsic currency is that it cannot be stopped.  It is censorship resitant since it does not represent any assets other than itself.

The problem to solve is its stability, since having no internal value, it is subject to speculation.

If the general compute market minted some of this currency each time computation was exchanged, based on the units computed, then this marker could be transferred around and used as money. So the money is an NFT representing completed computational work.

If the compute work is found to be false, then the NFT is rolled back.
After mint, it gets wrapped in one of our serverless objects, so can be traded with the same rules and provenances.

Its price would need to be free floating, as it would have value because it was believed to have value, and would be subject to swings.

The compute market could trade in this currency, to give it a base stability.
So if you want pure stability, you need to pay in fiat.  But if you can tolerate some volatility, then this currency may be good for you as it is unstoppable, and has an issuance mechism that artificially creates a scarcity.

So we start making them by default, and tie up their value into the compute chain somehow, to give them a base price.  The initial owner is whoever purchased the compute.  You can supply compute for only these tokens.

Purchasing compute for fiat is offering to buy some of these compute tokens at some set price.  

A unit of compute is always a unit, no matter what, and its always getting cheaper, but it is very stable.  It might get more expensive if energy gets more expensive.

The system may permit the redemption of  these tokens as some fraction of the total compute.  So they have a value, and act like a discount to the compute.

Can make it so only over a certain size generates tokens.
Maybe only the redeemable part is a token, and so the tokens can be spent to pay for compute, provided there is enough genuine load in the system.
They are always redeemable as long as there is enough paying customers of the main chain.  Their value is always stable because the resource they offer is stable, but slowly decaying.

A good way to spend them is to use them to purchase compute resources, offer this to people to purchase, then keep the coins generated as a side effect.

The issuer can tune the rate based on how much is outstanding, not bonded, current thruput, and current rates of change, or trends that are occuring.
Bonds can be issued where people promise to lock up their funds, or start to bleed them down in a measured sense.
The value being caputured is the utility of the interpulse algorithm as a programming model.

Purchase of currency can be done over time too, so there might not be enough around to be purchased, so you can park some funds and purchase the coins on a time payment model.  Provides a finance mechanism to incent large compute operations to be set up, as people with money are saying they will buy at a certain price, and so miners set up hardware, programmers make useful software, and the economy GDP(?) increases, fueling an upwards spiral.
