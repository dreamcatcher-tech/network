The process of moving a Project from within the hierarchy of a Sovereign Object to being a Sovereign Object in its own right. Before that move, the Sovereign Object in which the Project was embedded had complete control over that Project, including the ability to change any Covenant in the operation of the Dreamcatcher instance in which it was operating. After the move, the Project relies on the authoritative Dreamcatcher Covenants accessible in the Chainspace, which it canâ€™t alter.
