Typeof: Instance Project

Observers refer to a Project or Instance Project assessing whether a Ghost has sufficiently accurate data to be useful.

The assessment of a Ghost provides the Observer with a set of statements and the probability that each are true, and a combined probability for the whole Ghost. There are no privileged frames of reference - each Observer uses the information within the Ghost in any way they see fit and can combine it with other information (e.g. an assessment of the reputation of the Instance Project controlling the Ghost). It is always down to the Observer to judge what is useful, and by what degree..
