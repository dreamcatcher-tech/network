Within Identity/, Parameters are an extendable location for storing data, in any format, that is being put forward as representing the Ghost (Identity or Output) of which itâ€™s a part. Parameters can be assessed by an EvidenceAlgo.

Parameters are entirely extensible, but for example they can be descriptive (e.g. height, weight, bar codes and NFC IDs, filesize), can hold authentication data (e.g. private key, hash values for files), and can include the location of files both inside and outside of the chainscape.

Parameters can include incomplete data and hypothesised data. This allows the Observer to draw their own conclusions through the use of the proposed Evidence/, or to use an alternative Frame to decide whether the Instance Project can be relied on as the representation of the Asset it claims to represent, and to what extent.
