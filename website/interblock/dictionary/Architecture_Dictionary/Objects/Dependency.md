Dependencies are a child of a Ghost, and provide a list of Weak Links to the Ghosts that this Ghost depends on.

Dependencies may be automatically generated from a DependencyAlgo, e.g. returning a list of Ghosts which represent software needed by this Ghost.

Dependencies may also be manually entered where no automatic method is available. This may be in the form of a Weak Link to a Ghost, or a Citation.
