Typeof: Project

An Instance Project is intended to map, with some calculable level of certainty, to an Asset (be that a physical asset, digital asset, process or organisation (being in itself a collection of assets and processes)) as well as Dreamcatcher objects that we are uncertain about.

An Instance Project wraps an Identity and serves as an interface between an Asset and other Projects in the Dreamscape.

The certainty that an Instance Project can be usefully used in the Dreamscape as a representation of an Asset is provided by assessing its Identity.

Instance Projects may exist within a Projectâ€™s Projects/ location, or as Sovereign. An Instance Project can be claimed by a Project as an Output through a Hard Link in Outputs/.
