The general term for an Object which has been previously Forked from another Object, and which came into existence at that Fork. Used when referring to itself relative to its Origin.

The Branch of any given Object is completely under the authoritative control of the Object that caused the Fork (which is not necessarily the Origin. An Object can only have one Origin. If an object has no Origin, it is at the top level of the Chainscape, and is governed by its own logic alone. This hierarchy is similar to the supervisor tree in Erlang.
