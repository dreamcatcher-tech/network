Typeof: Contract

An offer of a reward for an associated Pull Request to be accepted. Can include conditions on any changes to the Projectâ€™s data, or remote project conditions, and can involve the exchange between banks. Pull Request Contracts are multi-purpose. E.g. for Wishes, it could be a payment on it becoming an Issue, or being converted to a Dependency. The ongoing discovery of agreement is a negotiation process centred on Pull Requests.
