The following is the stack on which Dreamcatcher is built. The lowest layers, as with ISO/OSI, are the more fundamental. Higher layers rely on layers below them.

> ## App Layer, Apps - e.g. Timesheets
>
> ## Utility Objects - Flowcreator, Dreamcatcher Appliance, Appstore
>
> ## Dreamcatcher Layer - Dreamcatcher
>
> ## DOS Layer - Dreamcatcher Operating System CLI
>
> ## Chain Layer - Interblock, Inversion
>
> ## Device Layer - Android, iOS, webdos

The whole stack is the Dreamcatcher Stack
