The following is the top level structure of a Dreamcatcher Object. Dreamcatcher Objects can perform various roles (e.g. representing Ghosts, Users, Projects, Assets, Contracts and so forth.). As such, not all of these top level Objects need be populated with data. Likewise, populating some (e.g. Evidence) changes the utility of the Object.
