### Goal

<!-- What is the goal of the appstore -->

### What, who and why

<!-- What does the appstore do, who does it do it for and why do they want to do that? -->

### Alternatives

<!-- What is the best current and foreseeable future alternative for each need identified in 1 and what makes the appstore better than that alternative -->

### Red queen

<!-- What is the sustainable competitive advantage that allows the appstore to stay ahead ahead of the alternatives -->

### Components

<!-- What are the components of the system. How do they work and how do they interact -->

All the components require at a minimum [DOS - upon which all applications run](interblock/wp_dos/) and [Interblock - the universal object protocol](interblock/wp_interblock/) which provides the underlying protocol for DOS and therefore all Dreamcatcher interactions.

Other components are:

1. Interblock

   1. DOS
      1. App Store
         1. Gitclone
         1. Inventors Notebook
         1. Agreemail
   1. Inversion currency NVN
   1. Universal Computing Surface

## Properties

1. First place to apply full value chain reward with super low overhead is to make an app store model for blockchain applications.
1. app stores are super easy to use, easy to develop for, and easy to understand.
1. App store Presents a standard interface, which is a precursor to a standard revenue model. A fairness revenue model does not coexist well with bespoke business models - it is infectious.
1. Standardized revenue model dictates standard consumption interface. fairness of consumption/inversion means freedom of consumption, which means an installation target owned completely by the users
