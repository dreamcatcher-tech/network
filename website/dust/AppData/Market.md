I'm not sure what goes in here exactly, but anything that smells like a negotiation belongs here.

Below are snippets from other files:

# From Ideas Template

## Proposed Timeline/Cost

This is the estimate on the part of the Person doing the work.

## Proposed Contract

This is the Offer from the Person doing the work. It covers what the license would be, whether up-front payment in exchange for downstream Attribution is requested, or for example full payment upfront without Attribution, or no payment with full Attribution.

# From Request Template

## Offer

The amount of cash, or other recompense such as attribution, that is owed to anyone meeting this Request.

### Timeline

An indication of what the maximum amount of elapsed time is permissable before the Request is irrelevalent from the point of view of the Requestor.

E.g. My house is on fire. I need it put out. Timeline 10-20 mins.
My company needs X. I've got to make a decision in 2-4 weeks.

NB it's not th timeline for the production of the Idea into code. That's down to the Request:Idea Contract to sort out.
