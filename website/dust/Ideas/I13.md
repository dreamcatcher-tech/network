# I13 Patent Pooling

Provide a way for patent owners to pool their patents and for consumers to purchase patent protection for each unit they sell, effectively making a pay as you earn model, avoiding up front costs.

The legal aspects will be managed automatically as well as royalty disbursements.

An arrangement of ligitation funds will be available for pooling too, where the money is used to enforce compliance.

By paying a small fee, implementors get protection from a larger force to keep them safe, rather than having to file their own litigation. This increases compliance with the patents as the chance of getting pursued is much higher in this arrangement.
