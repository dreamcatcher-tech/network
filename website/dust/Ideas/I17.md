## Targets

Request not yet written - dust Idea.

## Version

v0.1, dated 29 May 2022 

## Inherits

## Dependencies

None.

## Outputs

1. Company formation documentation.


## Concept

We need a company through which we can transact real-world cash and distribute that cash based on Contracts and Contributions.  Ideally we'd like that company to be very low overhead in administering, be in a convenient global location and in a low tax/low regulation jurisdiction.  That jurisdiction must not stop us from interacting in coherence of the [Dreamcatcher Charter].

## Approach

1. Investigate the use of [osome.com] and note any shortfalls.
1. If there any snags in using [osome.com], investigate a similar one-stop-shop service in other low tax, low regulation jurisdictions.
1. Incorporate the company, and note any legal requirements/diary entries we need to be aware of.
