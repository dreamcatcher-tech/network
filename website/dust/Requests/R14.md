# R14 Debugging Dreamcatchers

There are two types of debugging tooling we require

1. debugging Interblock chain complexes
1. debugging attribution and governance operations on Dreamcatcher objects

We want to be able to:

1. Replay any situation
1. Remove the need for logging, since we can replay the app
1. Make reproducible bug reporting trivial, as we can include chains with each report
1. Roll back, fix a bug, roll forward with a patched state, and with patched software, and replay any actions that were received since then ?
1. Be able to debug the engine itself using these very same tools, by making the engine itself run inside a blockchain

@rexmondo how mad would you be as a dev if I removed being able to receive replies in a reducer any other way but awaiting the promise returned from making the request ?
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
I think non blocking async await calls happen to me like 1/50 times or so
The clearest example I can think of is writing to a log, I don’t want to cede control flow to do that
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
oh you are welcome to fire and forget
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
Maybe I don’t grok then
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
I want to not dispatch any @@REPLY actions to the reducer ever
if you did not await the call, then you imply to me that you don't give AF about its response
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
I’m assuming replies are mapped into the expected action for the continuation?
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
but if you do await the call, then I will return the continuation action payload to you, or I will throw if it is rejected by the remote chain
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
Yeah, that’s very sane
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
ok good
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
That’s how we built it before too
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
HOWEVER if you fire and forget, and the remote side rejects, I will crash your reducer
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
You get the continuation action and the call environment
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
This is an error bubbling problem
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
i figure thats how node does it ? unhandled promise rejection ?
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
This is how real promises work
If the remote can reject you have to provide a continuation context to catch errors
I think that’s really sane too
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
from the programmers point of view in the reducer, these are real promises
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
Ya, it sounds like you got the model right
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
the gotcha is that I"m rerunning the devs code each time new replies come in
and if they don't give me the exact same requests in the exact same order, I burn them
because I can't really help someone who makes their code run differently
they may have missed the point of blockchain
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
Ok I'll roll with that
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
Lol
Yeah, what you’re saying is also why it’s a bad idea to expose the runtime mechanics too much, especially when it comes to continuation handling
The lower level you show them, the more likely they will hand you something unstructured
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
yeah 100%
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
And then in 40 years you will have windows
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
the oppression is there to help them 🤣
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
Exactly
Now, actually you probably do want to consider the case where I didn’t catch the error here but my caller wants to
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
V2 🤷
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
It’s actually really convenient in a program to let the higher levels of the program aggregate errors so you can logically centralize the user facing messages from those errors
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
continuation is a nightmare
I'm sorry I think I miss what you mean
maybe an example ?
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
So if I’m going to create an api, I always put the error handler right where I pick the routes I want to call into, the fan out/fan in point
That way there’s only one place to manage the communication back to the api caller, and I can keep a big list of error type->human readable message all in one spot
If you were to catch the errors right where they happen, you probably aren’t in the right context to even know how this is going to get sent back to the api caller
The way we did this before was to put a synthetic continuation that gets called only when an error hook is not supplied that finds the caller and replies to it with an error that we copy from the original error
You could do the same thing in userland too, we just added it automatically if you didn’t
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
hmmm........ I think that is handled by promise chaining, or by crashing if an unhandled exception occurs. I'll try double check this with you whenever our next call occurs
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
Yeah as long as you can chain promises you can bubble errors by just providing your own bubble code
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
I am currently passing the whole error itself
so you get the genuine error being thrown, stack trace and all
there isn't much of the JVM that I haven't serialized in some way by now 🤦
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
Hahaha
The other thing I played with when I was trying it is adding a chain trace in addition to the stack trace
As you hop back through the chains, adding them to the stack trace too
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
hey that's a really good idea
I'll put that in the backlog
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
Yeah, it’s like getting the async frames in node, it’s way more helpful than I expected
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
my dream is that along with those errors, we could give you a blockhash and you could fire up a tool that would recreate the exact situation that caused the error
plus autogenerate some jest tests using these hashes as the start point, since hey its all as permanent as you want it 🤷
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
That sounds real good
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
basically, fuck logs, especially in cloud environments
replay the whole app instead
honestly the size of the logs is usually so massive, and you're still not sure you captured everything you need
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
I love love love the idea of all errors coming with everything you need to understand them
And replay them
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
and if its safe to do so, the general public should be able to replay them and fix them
go to sleep, some error happens, wake up - fixed already
they just own a small piece of your attribution
I mean if you can repro the error by default, things should be much easier
that's often most of the struggle anyways
#yoco you only crash once
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
That's actually crazy powerful now that I think about it in the context of onboarding noobs - their app throws an error, it auto generates an IPFS link to the blockhash, channelId, and action number, then we can replay it exactly in browser
welcome to the permanent errors web 🤣
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
its also a super powerful toolkit for interacting with foreign chains
you can trace all the way back to the foreign input
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
yeah
that's a different set of tooling that I dream about tho
like each time you change something, replay all your foreign chain interactions and make sure you still give back the same results
oh wait sorry - you're talking about when you first encounter an error
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
no impedance mismatch across the known set of interactions! thats amazing
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
yeah, so you can actually force semver increments
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
i meant it as like if their input causes my error, i can adapt my model of their system
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
derived semver!
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
"hey we just replayed your code against everyone who ever called the last version, and some of the output was different so therefore your interface has changed - welcome to your new major version"
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
👍
hopefully we can sell some of this, as semver verification as a service, or other such changeables
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
i think its easily sellable
dependency versioning is a nightmare
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
so is repro
but solving both problems together should be quite liberating
repro is pretty much the heart of blockchain - we should be using it as a programming tool
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
100%
im just imagining a version bump process where the entire history of using the dependency is replayed using the new version and you can see the entire affected surface of your app
mcnasty — 02/28/2022
oh wow that would be super helpful
then you could even auto upgrade so long as nothing changed
then it gets fun, since we need staked pools to guarantee nothing sneaky made it in there
that's the exciting shit - politics, money, code all swirling in one big cauldron lol
anyway I'm out for the day - catch you later 👊
rexmondo — 02/28/2022
Peace
