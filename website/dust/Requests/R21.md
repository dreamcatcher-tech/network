# R21 Small Topics

To avoid polluting the dust folder, here is a collection of small ideas that may be built upon. When the Dreamcatcher runs in software this will not be an issue, and even a tweet can be dropped in to the machine, but while using markdown, dust pollution is a problem.

## Nutshell

Drawing on [Nutshell by Ncase](https://ncase.me/nutshell-wip/try/) we can make [nutshell](https://github.com/ncase/nutshell-beta) that is backed by a blockchain. These can be reusable on other sites, and can be edited and updated / raised issues against.

We can point to other sites to references parts of their html. Initially we would populate it with our own view of that site, and may make some edits. Each time someone consumes the nutshell, they would fetch their view of the remote url, and add an upvote using their reputation, or introduce a conflict.

## Dreamcatchers AI Vision

There was a conversation with msm about what the final destination of the Dreamcatcher would be. This should be extracted from the whatsapp chat and turned into a request.

## Music app from rexmondo

Another good whatsapp conversation that needs to be fleshed out here.
