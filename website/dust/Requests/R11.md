## Strategic Intent

At great human and economic cost, resources drawn from the U.S. Government, industry and the academic community were assembled into a collection of interconnected networks called the Internet. We should NFT all the contributions that made it and we should begin to pay attribution to those contributors who made this machine we depend upon so strongly.

The deep purpose of the Dreamcatcher is to provide complete attribution to all who contributed, back through to the big bang.  
We will always fall short, but can easily provide some base contribution trees for commonly consumed Assets such as the Internet.
We must begin to use our system in pursuit of this ideal as soon as possible.

To that end, we want to take the [list of RFCs that made the Internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_RFCs), and derive an attribution tree
from them, which we will begin to pay out whenever some action takes place in our systems.
We cannot possibly do until the begining of time, and so we suggest choosing a start date, say the unix epoch, then a stop time, say 20 years later.
Having an attribution tree for a narrow time period based on hard to dispute facts is a powerful start, and demonstrates how
Ambient Attribution pays out to anyone who contributed, not just those who own shares.
