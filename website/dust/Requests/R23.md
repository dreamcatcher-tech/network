# R23 Email

In October, a price increase will occur for all of their Bin customers. Every customer affected by this needs to be emailed before that time.

Concurrently, a new website is nearly ready to be launched, and ideally the email blast would go out with links to the new website.

Lastly, a CRM application is being developed using the Dreamcatcher, and so the ideal scenario is that the customer self service portal is available by then too.
