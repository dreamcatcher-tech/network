Be able to show a finished version of the napp package browser widget, and then link pieces that are not yet made to nfts to get them built.  Talk about what it needs to have this feature.

Can also list features in plain text form as well.

Turn on the features in the widget so it works with pieces mocked and pieces turned off, so it can be enabled gradually as work completes.
