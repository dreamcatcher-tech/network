We have many build processes in gh.
Make a widget that reads the last build status of all of them and presents that as a dashboard.

but later we would do the build on our infrastructure, so it doesn't really matter as we can read this directly ?

but we would still want to manage a fleet of builds, regardless.
and we want to take action when events occur.
