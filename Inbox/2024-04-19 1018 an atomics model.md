If there was some way to measure the efficiency of an atomics model ?
show probability of collisions as some loads ramp up, so score the model based on its failure to load ratio.  A good model should have load increasing logarithmically, or be constant collision.

Big O notation can be used the same here, as it describes how retries increase with concurrent load.

Basically should go thru doing every action in every order and outputting the result.
