If we're both building a CRM under the hood, given how hard CRMs are, it doesn't make sense to both be trying to build this.

Monetizing customers, where a commission is paid to whomever signed a customer up to the network first is another means of revenue for companies.

If two competitors are signed up, they might complain why would I hand over my customer data and risk them switching to my competitor - if you don't, then switching back will be harder.  If there is now a 3rd competitor that joins the network, and you're still disconnected, customers will switch.

We are restoring the switchability in the marketplace that made it a market in the first place.

Also they would switch to that competitor if they offered a better deal anyway, all you'd do is slow it down.

Plus as all these other services come online, then there is stronger reason to be on the network anyway.

Makes starting a new business much easier, since already listed in this closed network.

Can trust the raytio data storage because of its not for profit nature.

But can also allow multiple raytios to exist, so long as they were compatible.   They would need to have the same ambient attribution systems, else they would be accused of being profit centric, and therefore corruptible.

Payment processor advantages, since we can process payments locally, or can allow a balance to be held with raytio, then we can keep the fees very low.  These balance holdings can be used to do highly efficient micropayments.

Hold all the private data, so that a fully on chain system can operate where it only holds anonymized tokens.  Raytio can periodically shuffle all the tokens around ?  Or, for independent actions, can make several tokens actually be the same one, so we hide the plurality of some actions.

If all the PII is stripped out so that a fully transparent system can operate, then we have no fear of data breaching.

Raytio could sell insurance to cover breaches, or offer it as part of the service.  No system is unbreakable, we are tested and certified regularly, so we can prove we are the best, but you can purchase insurance in the event that we do get breached.

The value of Raytio at that point is in the network, so if there was a transactional fee, then we could give the service away for free, which increases induction.  Now in the competition of CRM software, we are superior since we beat everyone on cost.

We keep the costs down due to a reduction in fraud, and the enablement of low cost transaction methods like bank transfers, or using internal platform credits.  We have excellent exchange rates, and we provide forward cover instruments for FX trading.

The network of customers is what keeps this thing safe. The self sovereign data, the switchability of all forms of control, and so long as ambient attribution is upheld, even the foundational providers can switch out.
