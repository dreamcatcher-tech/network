It seems the less in the way we are, the better the quality of the output, and the better our experience.

So when making a module, like the moneyworks module, it might be better to just give it the docs, and the interface we want to use to save the files and sync the files, and let it figure out the rest.

Periodically we should get the bots to try reduce the functional description of the module down, then try build the module from scratch 10 different ways, and see if either way yields any improvements.
