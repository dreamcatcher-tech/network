If we dump the transactions to file, like a big xml or json file, then we can load it up into code interpreter to do complex queries on it.

With some looping around, we could make queries that we can be sure of their correctness perhaps.

Best guarantee is to move it into our schema format,  and then use our mango query language to get out the items we want.
