Be able to efficiently manipulate a large number of files
arbitrarily deep sharding using hashes of the files.
Index files in the root that are rebalanced periodically.

Means we should be able to store arbitrarily large number of files.

Split apart large files to make storing easier too.
Use the same large file tools in the big dir project, and ensure they can be used together without collisions.

Possibly bake this into the api so it appears native.
