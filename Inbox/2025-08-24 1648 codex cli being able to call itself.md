If we made a tool that was an mcp server, and meant that this bot could call itself, is that the agents calling agents that we want ?

definitely makes it easier to think about, this atom of bot.

we can make isomorphic git be the actual git tool in use, so we can do checkout ?
or, we can make 
Can scope or phase the work by the level of difficulty, and the gains we get.
Using real git with a local fs, we are still dark edge, as there isn't much use in having partial data during a run, when the run is long.  

Updates could be pushed out, but could be an explicit side band tool.

phases:
1. git on raw disk - benefit: speed of implementation
2. virtualized disk - benefit: efficient filesystem usage for large repos, init speed low, many concurrent runners are very light, git server load is small and long, vs high and short.
3. replace with our own tools - benefit: ??? at this point we are no longer riding codex and may have lost shell tools
