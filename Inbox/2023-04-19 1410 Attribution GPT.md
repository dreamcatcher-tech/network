If we can collect data from project interactions, we should be able to train a model that will balance the contributions of all, and assign results from it.

These models will need large amounts of data, and perhaps traditional companies can be modelled enough from their filed returns that it can be learned from.

Can the model account for its own affect upon itself ?
