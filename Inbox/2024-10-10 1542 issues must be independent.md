We do not want to raise an issue against a particular napp, we want to raise it against a capability.

So the issue and the test for it are free floating and separate from any given solution, as napps are packages of unit tests functionality, that are combined to produce solutions.

napps may pull in a range of issues tests when the prove how well they work.
