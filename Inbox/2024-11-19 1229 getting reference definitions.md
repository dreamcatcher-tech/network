If we broke apart each individual file that would be easier to:
1. see the relationship of the knowledge tree within the items
2. see changes being proposed, since a single text file means changes are quite noisy

So long as we could easily generate a full document to insert into the AI directly ?

Could make a small script to run and assemble all the individual things into a single output.

Or make an AI tool that will run and provide a filtered view of the items.
