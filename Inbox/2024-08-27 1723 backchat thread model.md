There is only one thread, and it is a long thread.
Making a new one simply blanks this one ? or just makes a new one with a different name ?
Or starts a new backchat thread ?
Generate a whole new thread.
Switching back to it would 

Separate the thread from the backchat.
Backchat then, is not a thread, but a comms channel.
It takes in all the prompts, runs them past M.

Why even make a superuser thread ? it just needs a backchat, nothing more.

Backchat is your identifying terminal.  It gets authenticated IO in and out of the system.

Threads are in their own branch, as peers to backchat ? or, as children of the `threads` branch, which might run a controller ?
