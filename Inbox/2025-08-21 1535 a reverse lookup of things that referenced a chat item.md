if the user puts in some info, this is our most valuable information.

Many different agents should spawn off from this.

We need a way for all of them to register or link how they connected.

so if we have a datastructure that holds this info, then when we display the users input, we can provide a way to see quickly what tee'd off it, and what things were triggered by it.

This is like a trigger map.

A trigger might get inserted in a long running thread, so it needs a reference system to indicate where it got triggered from.

If the trigger system itself was in fact the registry / job queue, then we can use this for reverse lookups.
