So the exchange has every aspect of its operations on chain, and the costs assosciated with each.  Workers are also gaining royalties for the work they do offset against the price they charged.

The key is providing the KYC services of the exchange, like a government grade identity provider.

Then as an exchange, you already hold funds and have banking relationships, so you might as well be the identity provider.

If we could build this system using NL as programming, it should be rapid to launch it.

So then people could use this exchange as their place to store info safely, and to make payments out of.  They can use it for holding their emails as well, with disposable addresses for the sites they use.  The sites connected in this way can use AI integrations to get them to do things for the user.

Have power of attorney so we can chase down bad payments and other issues on peoples behalf.

If we hold money and people use us to pay for things, we can guarantee rapid settlement.
