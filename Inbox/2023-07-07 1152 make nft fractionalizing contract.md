transferring an NFT into this contract can auto split the control of it between people.

The image and properties are decorated with an overlay to indicate it is fractional.  Zoom the image out and put a border on it representing the share.

[[DreamEther Packets]] contract can auto transfer NFTs that it holds as packet funds.  This sends the NFT out, and returns back shares in the NFT, which can then be withdrawn by each solutionShare holder.

Splits can also have votes that say what to do with the NFT.  These would be functions on the controlling contract, or could be any contract, and would be specified by saying what function we want to call and with what params.

Then holders would need to come and vote on what proposals they were in favour of enacting.

Relationships can be set up between options, for dependencies being in order, and batch operations can be done.

Actions can be loaded with gastokens to make it easier to act without costing a lot of gas.

? could the dreamether transitions be used as a means of getting approval and funding these different transitions ?  So once a packet is resolved, some kind of function is called ?
