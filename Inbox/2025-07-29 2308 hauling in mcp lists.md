scrape these lists, and if they are local hosted, make them run as a napp, by stripping out how they interact, or by running them up in isolation and plying them with the exact network calls they expect.

Easier to extract out the code for them into a napp, and then call them that way.

we could also connect to the remote ones on behalf, and can broker payments and auth with these services.

make a generic api server gateway thing ?
