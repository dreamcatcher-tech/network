If it could act as its own trace collector, then we could use AI to interpret the trace results, draw graphs, and other types of tooling, without being locked into a given platforms interpretation.

Can replay a given trace inside the system, so the trace becomes more of a chain, where traces are built in, so this is more a translation layer to morph chains into telemetry data.

Need to get to the stage where we can view spans in traces, and then go back and replay the code in the context, and debug.  Then patch it, and replay everything, then switch over to this modified branch.
