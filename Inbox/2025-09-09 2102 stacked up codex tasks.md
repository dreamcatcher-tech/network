If we work hard to make a very succinct task, then we can stack them, so we're not stuck waiting for stuff to happen.

we could fork and do this work in a branch, but often it is much cleaner to do sequentially.

we need to store the chat and instructions that went in, since these are intent and are required to understand what was going on.  Merging and git operations that work with intent, like dedupe, need to be part of the toolset.

if each instruction was actually a little piece of work, then we can always recheck if for intent after some prior work has been done, in case it needs modificaiton.
