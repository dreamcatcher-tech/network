It would be great if whenever I learn something (e.g., I'm using OpenAI's Deep Research to find out a bunch of things and ultimately solve the problem) it would be really useful to have that information as well as all the surrounding context (why I needed to know that, what I also tried, what the deep research tested) stored somewhere so that others could learn from it. And even better to be able to pay a small micro fee to me when that information was of benefit because it saved them from at least burning further tokens and may have had other valuable impacts on them. Sort of like a Stack Overflow reply that's very useful, it shows you could actually have some kind of a payment based on how useful it was.
