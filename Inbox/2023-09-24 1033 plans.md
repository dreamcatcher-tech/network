get to a stage where we can be writing purely promotional pieces about what we are trying to do, to ensure our long term goals are clear, and that the NFTs are created to represent that.

faceless apps being a big cost centre.
AI faceless apps framework, NFT dreamcatcher network, blockchain that acts as the box for the AI, and is NFT native.  If the dreamcatcher was the first one, plus a few others, then we can make that model available for others to use in this same way. 

"this same way" means blockchain and AI native, where maybe nobody needs to know about blockchain.

then theres hosting as well.

4 things make up the invention machine
1. NFT based contribution and advertisement, with AI decision automation for royalty splits
2. Interpulse blockchain based app framework for running AIs on and interfacing with them
3. AI interface to applications that combines many models
4. public chain where trading of compute resources is the foundation for trading assets and labour

Of these 4 things, there are many other areas that they can be useful, but in combination together they offer a solution to the laggard innovation rate of human invention.  There are other AIs that are useful to the system, like discovery and invention assistance, but they system can operate without these.  If the friction of human commercial relationships continues, then the innovation rate will remain stagnant or even negative.

4 pillars:
1. NFT based contribution record system - the packetizer
2. Blockchain based framework for running apps on, including safe AI
	1. the framework specializes in faceless apps, where AI is the primary means of interaction
3. AI for determining royalties
4. public chain for the trading of compute resources and a single source of truth and comms

Blockchains are about exchanging things.

The public chain is the invention machine.

framework being native means you can just access the AI services with no extra costs or frictions.

invention machine.
lead with this.

drop and idea in - write a bunch of scenarios.
We should be able to describe a bunch of scenarios of usage of the machine, like a simple idea and watch it grow.

Invention machine has been the same since we first caught a glimpse of it.

Pubco is to invest funds using the capital mechanism of the public chain, to build the components starting with the shakiest scrappiest version we can come up with first, and then iterate on that.  The ultimate payment is the decision automation that determines value between labour and labour, and capital and labour, for all participants of the public chain.

The software is a box that AI sits inside of.

We have enough of the public chain put together that we can use those pieces to build itself out.

We want some funding to test the assemblage sooner rather than later.  We can keep working on each piece.  Adoption is key, and we think we can get there.

The Dreamcatcher is an invention machine.  It is self improving and so we can begin to use it now to build itself and other revenue producing assets.

Leveraging blockchain and AI together

Invention machine was too hard to build up till now, but we think we can automate it to make it feasible.
The only way you can automate that is with AI.
Only way to coordinate people all round the world is using blockchain.

we wanted an invention machine, but it was infeasible.

Detailing the plan in NFTs will help us.

The invention machine is the integration of all the useful components we have built mini versions of.  Axle better than a wheel.

We can test the NFT piece before any other piece.  This element handles recognition and negotiation of work.  In isolation it is already better, we think.

We integrate wherever possible, but some pieces we need to build.  

Innovation machine is a factory.  That factory is ready, we think, to build things.

If you put in a single idea, it should be amplified to a running product that sells and then it also shuts down.  Show amplification and evolution.  Hand over the entire team 10 times?  Redo the codebase x times ?  Profitability - money in greater than investment in ?

It is a convergence of technologies that enable it, and we think we have the hardest part - the blockchain - well underway.  The zeitgeist is with us.

Mechanized invention.
### Phases:
NFT system first using smart contract as base - first gen NFTs
CRM as a popular class of application to sell.
Build itself up more.
Build out the blockchain for SaaS apps, starting with packetizer and CRM
Run AI models on chain
Build a private chain hosting mechanism - not decentralized
Build an AI for attribution based on contribution - mechanized invention - negotiation is 
	reduce lifecycle friction
automated - use usage data from the packet system to train on
launch a public chain trading GPU resources
Dreamcatcher launched - all further activity is within the dreamcatcher, rather than outside - the two halves of contribution and attribution have been mated using automation.

## Packets required for the framework piece:
authentication - start with auth0
webapp publishing - make a single static page used by all, at a specifc dns address, and the page knows what dns name it loaded from so can fetch the appropriate chain for that address.
bundling of the chain covenants using vite.
bunding of a vite app into a chain covenant so it can be loaded by just a chain loader.
credit card payments to get AI credits.
an app store where apps are published, and can manage user data in a governed way.
Then we have the basics of a webapp that is made very rapidly, well tested, and easy to report bugs on.  
Give them NLP interfaces so that people can file bugs easily, and new apps can be mashed up by causing the chain logic to be shared.

First to tackle the biggest inefficiencies in the innovation marketplace, we need to make it fit a predefined structure.  
In order to automate innovation, we need it to take place in a standard form with guaranteed correct data.  In that standard form, we can already solve x y z inefficiencies, and 
Diagram of relative size of friction in invention machine right now, and the order that we are tackling each one.

So make an NFT for each phase, and show relationships between them all.

Being the box that contains AI and makes it trustable.

The system is all about being to build and sell products.  At each phase, we have a system that can be used to build and sell useful products of increasing capabilities.

These first apps can be the thing we vend into the pubco.

The Apps are the value, but the Dreamcatcher is the factory and internal company processes by which these things are made and sustained.

Attribution is growing in importance as data is becoming the same as code due to AI training.

invite problems, if we don't know, turn it into an NFT.  Turn a prompt straight into an NFT.

Are we talking about having a hybrid interface here ?  How to make any app have an AI assitant component, which can be maximized, or half screened, or minimized.

Buyers would interact with an app store primarily, not with the packet network - they are the end of the system, not the inner workings.  So the app store is a separate component of the system, and distributes payments back to all who participated in packets.  The QA allocates shares for the instant payment of funds from funders - when doing royalty calculations this

Buyers are valued for proving the demand, and so like early kickstarter backers they receive recognition later.

Designing the AI
embeddings use the previous passed QA packets.
We are training the AI on how to write tasks accurately.

Packetizer AI should be preformated, and we edit.  These should compete.

Buy side is the creation of a store and payment processing for usage, hosting of apps, and the start of royalty distributions.  Funders and Solvers are part of phase1 - pure nft packets.  Buyers are phase2 - the store.  The ai is the final stage.

The AI needs a section on the website as the final stage.

Our website should be defined in terms of market inefficiencies that we are addressing.  It doesn't talk about the store at all, and doesn't talk about the blockchain framework, or the AI.

Talk about how we take no cut, we accept attribution the same as everyone else.

Micropayments is part of the royalty streams requirement, hence needs our own blockchain for this part.

Making a public chain lets people use their household GPU capacity and sell it for the purposes of running AI computations.  This is profitable in itself, and using attribution AI can pay out to initial funders well.  All that is required, is to believe that the AI can be constructed and that it will be adopted, which is the same ask of any other token sale.  The difference with us, is that there is no token at all - merely deduction off fairness from open data.
