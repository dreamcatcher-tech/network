get to a stage where we can be writing purely promotional pieces about what we are trying to do, to ensure our long term goals are clear, and that the NFTs are created to represent that.

designing pieces of the protocol

Make a clear pitch about what we want the pubco to be

Be able to experiment with faceless apps, specification of work, continual tweaking by users.

monte carlo for testing paths.

DOS apps that are @xstate/test ed.

faceless apps being a big cost centre.
AI faceless apps framework, NFT dreamcatcher network, blockchain that acts as the box for the AI, and is NFT native.  If the dreamcatcher was the first one, plus a few others, then we can make that model available for others to use in this same way. 

"this same way" means blockchain and AI native, where maybe nobody needs to know about blockchain.

then theres hosting as well.

4 things make up the invention machine
1. NFT based contribution and advertisement, with AI decision automation for royalty splits
2. Interpulse blockchain based app framework for running AIs on and interfacing with them
3. AI interface to applications that combines many models
4. public chain where trading of compute resources is the foundation for trading assets and labour

Of these 4 things, there are many other areas that they can be useful, but in combination together they offer a solution to the laggard innovation rate of human invention.  There are other AIs that are useful to the system, like discovery and invention assistance, but they system can operate without these.  If the friction of human commercial relationships continues, then the innovation rate will remain stagnant or even negative.

4 pillars:
1. NFT based contribution record system - the packetizer
2. Blockchain based framework for running apps on, including safe AI
	1. the framework specializes in faceless apps, where AI is the primary means of interaction
3. AI for determining royalties
4. public chain for the trading of compute resources and a single source of truth and comms

Blockchains are about exchanging things.

The public chain is the invention machine.

framework being native means you can just access the AI services with no extra costs or frictions.

invention machine.
lead with this.

drop and idea in - write a bunch of scenarios.
We should be able to describe a bunch of scenarios of usage of the machine, like a simple idea and watch it grow.

Invention machine has been the same since we first caught a glimpse of it.

Pubco is to invest funds using the capital mechanism of the public chain, to build the components starting with the shakiest scrappiest version we can come up with first, and then iterate on that.  The ultimate payment is the decision automation that determines value between labour and labour, and capital and labour, for all participants of the public chain.

The software is a box that AI sits inside of.

We have enough of the public chain put together that we can use those pieces to build itself out.

We want some funding to test the assemblage sooner rather than later.  We can keep working on each piece.  Adoption is key, and we think we can get there.

The Dreamcatcher is an invention machine.  It is self improving and so we can begin to use it now to build itself and other revenue producing assets.

Leveraging blockchain and AI together

Invention machine was too hard to build up till now, but we think we can automate it to make it feasible.
The only way you can automate that is with AI.
Only way to coordinate people all round the world is using blockchain.

we wanted an invention machine, but it was infeasible.

Detailing the plan in NFTs will help us.

The invention machine is the integration of all the useful components we have built mini versions of.  Axle better than a wheel.

We can test the NFT piece before any other piece.  This element handles recognition and negotiation of work.  In isolation it is already better, we think.

We integrate wherever possible, but some pieces we need to build.  

Innovation machine is a factory.  That factory is ready, we think, to build things.

If you put in a single idea, it should be amplified to a running product that sells and then it also shuts down.  Show amplification and evolution.  Hand over the entire team 10 times?  Redo the codebase x times ?  Profitability - money in greater than investment in ?

Packet to construct a simple test for the network.
Also the dashboard for measuring the dreamcatcher.

QA test for securities as a means of detecting scammers.

It is a convergence of technologies that enable it, and we think we have the hardest part - the blockchain - well underway.  The zeitgeist is with us.

Mechanized invention.
### Phases:
NFT system first using smart contract as base.
CRM as a popular class of application to sell.
Build itself up more.
Build out the blockchain for SaaS apps
Run AI models on chain
Build a private chain hosting mechanism - not decentralized
Build an AI for attribution based on contribution - mechanized invention - negotiation is automated - use usage data from the packet system to train on
launch a public chain trading GPU resources
Dreamcatcher launched - all further activity is within the dreamcatcher, rather than outside - the two halves of contribution and attribution have been mated using automation.

So make an NFT for each phase, and show relationships between them all.

Being the box that contains AI and makes it trustable.

The system is all about being to build and sell products.  At each phase, we have a system that can be used to build and sell useful products of increasing capabilities.

These first apps can be the thing we vend into the pubco.

The Apps are the value, but the Dreamcatcher is the factory and internal company processes by which these things are made and sustained.

Attribution is growing in importance as data is becoming the same as code due to AI training.

invite problems, if we don't know, turn it into an NFT.  Turn a prompt straight into an NFT.

Packet for making the website be AI integrated
Prompt as iframe so any site can use dreamcatcher to spec bugs and ideas
? should we make the chats be public ?

runs on the blockchain, managed by Dreamcatcher.

Get the fullspek work on chain.  Devs hungering for their NFTs to be made.
AS doing project plan as packets.

Protocol for commerce interaction is built in.
