If solutions that come after the packet has closed are marked as better, then

QA should indicate which solution is best

Could stack rank the solutions somehow ?

Maybe this is simply not QAs job... ?

How should a late solutions shares be recorded in the packet ?

What about improvments on shares ?

If you haven't claimed, then you may receive a different amount of the funds, if late solutions come along ?
