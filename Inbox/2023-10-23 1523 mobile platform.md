Use a pair of espresso 17s, a framework laptop module with 4 - 6 thunderbolt ports, 2 - 4 AI accelerators, and some sharge battery packs and sharge chargers, we should be able to assemble a demo kit for on the go.

The sharge packs would show the power drain from the accelerators, and the laptop module, so can get a guage of usage - hopefully can see the laptop not doing much and the AI accelerators draining hard.

So all these things could have a 3D printed travel case made, so they can be shown at investor pitches, or be used to supply acceleration to a group of machines.
