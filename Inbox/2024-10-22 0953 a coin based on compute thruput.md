Once we get some value thruput in our system, we can inflate our internal currency based on how much usage is occuring.  Basically th proposition is that if you hold these credits you can purchase compute units in the future at market rate, but because the value goes up by an inflated amount based on adoption, you can purchase it and sell it for more money later.

Designed a formula for a currency that is backed by compute resources. The idea is that people pay assets, let's call it US dollars, for a certain measure of computing to be done. As the number of people wanting that and the number of compute units purchased goes up, a stable pattern starts to form. Particularly since the demand is made of multiple independent consumers. What that means is that if there's an internal currency, the value of the currency can be increased slightly as a represent of the stable throughput and the growth of the network. The idea being if you purchase compute units early and held them for a year, you should be able to sell them for more, where how much more is determined by the rate of growth of the platform. And so I need to know how this would be calculated and a number of scenarios that would affect it like a mass withdrawal, a drop in computational consumption. And whatever other factors, this all might not be possible so I do need an appraisal to determine the feasibility of it. The reliability of the currency should be based on the fact that computing always costs roughly the same amount and is stable from year to year. As well, the price of computing is always going down. As a platform becomes large and the throughput becomes predictable, this is something that we can base a currency upon. It's almost like a form of gold because it's always in demand and it always takes roughly the same amount of effort to make it. But over time, slow macro changes mean that it can be inflated, particularly if there is a computational mechanism put in there like a monetary policy that controls the rate at which some sort of central market maker operates.
