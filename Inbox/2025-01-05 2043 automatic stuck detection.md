During the conversation if the user says that they don't like something or wishes a correction to the bot, it shouldn't need to be a direct stuck, we should be able to analyse it and say what was it about that that they didn't like and include this in the training or shaping data that makes the system behave a lot more like how they would expect it to go. So this is them giving in-band correction to the bot.
