If both parties use AA, then it is guaranteed to be fair, no matter what version, since all versions guarantee non discrimination.

If only one party uses it, then we might need to keep an eye on things since it would be hard to trust that any future version would be ok, but if both parties are using it, and each current version gurantees the properties of the successor, then we should be able to have any future version be enforceably used too, even tho we don't know what that version is yet.

If any person can sit in any role and it all works out the same, then its fair.  Like mating 3 surfaces to get flatness.
