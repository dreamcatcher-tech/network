The template for the helps would say what each section did, and how the file was arranged.

Passing the template and the file should be sufficient for how to edit it.

This pairing is called a self editing file collection - because if you provide the template to the AI, it will know how to create a blank file, and honour things like required and other types of notation.

The format of the template is a standardized thing that we describe and maintain.

When something is expected to be in a given format, we would provide an isolate that was designed to interact with it.  This checks the format and constrains the operations that can be done on the file.  Ideally the machine deals in plain text as much as possible, but sometimes executables need to be operated based on formats in text, so here we need to ensure the format is correct and matches a schema.
This manages the machine AI interface.

The template is like a schema, but for AI.

Editor with format on save - so you can freeform edit the document, but when you save, the AI tries to format it correctly, and may ask you questions to ensure it formats it correctly.
