I think we can start to see what the primary use case of the system is where I should be able to continually talk to the machine and then have changes across the board being rolled out, modified, I can switch my focus by a command and basically all day long it's doing what I would otherwise take notes to do, but also generating those notes further, providing additional information I wasn't aware of, retrieving previous notes and additional information, cleaning up the statement and continually pushing forwards a canonical knowledge base or requirements document that has lists of ideas and wishes. It then publishes these things online and finds others who can work on them, as well as expending credits to move some of those features forwards.
