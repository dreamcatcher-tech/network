I think we can start to see what the primary use case of the system is where I should be able to continually talk to the machine and then have changes across the board being rolled out, modified, I can switch my focus by a command and basically all day long it's doing what I would otherwise take notes to do, but also generating those notes further, providing additional information I wasn't aware of, retrieving previous notes and additional information, cleaning up the statement and continually pushing forwards a canonical knowledge base or requirements document that has lists of ideas and wishes. It then publishes these things online and finds others who can work on them, as well as expending credits to move some of those features forwards.

Requirements of a system should be a separate section, and they should be independent of the current implementation.

This allows reconciliation with what we want a thing to do, and ideas we have on how it can do it, and what the system currently does.

The Vintsoft software needs to allow me to chat about different concepts and then have those things put into a knowledge base or a tree of knowledge where the information is specifically arranged to be easily retrievable by both machine and human. It allows us to update requirements and specifications of a thing whilst also separating our discussions and ideations so that without the difficulty of collating multiple similar ideas we can have an automatically AI boosted version of these requirements and my work allows me to jump between them all fairly effortlessly because the lookup is handled by the machine. It's not doing a vector lookup, it's actually parsing each individual file to find the best place where a particular comment matches best. It would have built up its own indexes that describe what these files are, what they do, what you can use for a reverse lookup. This is better than a vectorization. It's basically a focus summarization to allow it to walk this tree-like structure. They could also be made to specifically handle history so that at each point the history of that branch is also summarized so that we can go back in time and find things at a particular state as well.
