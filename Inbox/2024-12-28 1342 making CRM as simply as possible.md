Run a nextjs app locally, and have a local version of deno deploy ?

use ngrok to access this application, so we can call on it to do things, rather than requiring it to have a webhook to artifact ?  Lets us tunnel it and browse the app too.

Use artifact as the db ?  yes, since we can download that.

This will avoid needing any kind of auth.

Run a local app, and run the cli on the same hardware.
