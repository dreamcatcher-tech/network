It might be that every interaction or payment within the platform could be treated as an attributable event. So rather than only paying attribution inside specific marketplaces like the Compute marketplace, the Labor marketplace, and the Innovation marketplace, those things. We could make it that any transfer of this currency attracts attribution, plus if you hold it, you receive attribution in some way. It is pegged to some of the key marketplaces like the Compute and the labor as a means of capturing some of the growth that is going on as well as having an intelligent money supply manager. 

We may not be able to launch a currency until we have demonstrable adoption occurring in specific markets as well as a proven way to do intelligent money management. We can paint the target of this currency. But its construction has dependencies.
