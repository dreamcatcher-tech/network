Make it be a fullscreen modal, which scrolls inside the modal, so it is always sandwiched up, in effect.

The stateboard for backchat would be a view of all your chats.

It is not meant to manage files, it is meant to manage chats.  It can let you jump out of a given bot, too, as the sessions are arranged in a heirarchy, since sessions can start other bots.

Be able to undo a prompt, so it goes back to that point and forks.
This would be what putting a button to edit a historical prompt would do.
Backchat would be aware of the session history, and each commit, and would fork at that point.

Backchat is what would stop a running thing from going any further - "backchat halt"

## Tasks
- reset this backchat
- reset the current thread
- roll back 3 statements in the current thread
- show me the history of the conversation
