The most Dreamcatcher way that cancer trials can be handled by our system is that finding a patient would earn some attribution if the trial was successful. Additionally, the patients should be able to earn attribution if the trial was successful as well they paid in terms of risk. There would no doubt need to be some ethics to make sure that this isn't exploited. 

The blunt up-front version is that Dreamcatcher gets paid for people joining the trial and a referral program that measures those who find other people so that everyone gets paid and helps their friends get better and helps progress the science.
