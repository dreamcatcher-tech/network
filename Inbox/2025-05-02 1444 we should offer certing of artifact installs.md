We provide bots, tooling, and a network of solution solvers that let you get your app done quickly and help your problems get solved either for free or for money. As you work, problems are posted online and hoisted. If you're working in clear, you can narrow the group to which these problems are seen, and the problems can be jet generalized, making them more widely solvable. 

Furthermore, if you develop on Artifact, we should offer a service where when you are ready you can be searched and audited and approved or stamped and insured by us so that your application is known to be correct. In this way, we can take you from an idea to a chatted app to an ISO-compliant and SOC-compliant HIPAA compliant app with very little time and money + keep your certification during the changes that you make. 

This should be very fast + with Human-in-the-Loop we are continually improving our base model and knowledge base, so that newcomers get an even better experience, and the humans are used even less. But you will always need to pay for the certification.
