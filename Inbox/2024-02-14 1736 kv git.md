Can build it so that each successive commits leave the prior state of the .git folder intact.
So that we can rapidly reference any given commit.

There might be very little modification to git itself required here, since it is designed to always be an additive system.
It can be troublesome when pack is involved, but we can also have some kind of fallback so if a specific commit is requested by it has been packed, then you would get the next pack in sequence.
