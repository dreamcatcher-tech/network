if the model understood how the state machine worked, then it would know what the current state was, and therefor what the allowed moves were.  If it picks the wrong thing, we error helpfully.  So basically we can pack very complex groups of actions in, and the model just interacts with the state machine to get thigns done, like browsing, or file editing.
