A delay in returning is not always a side effect - it could be batched computation.


`api.useTimeout()`
`api.useCron()` - trigger events on a schedule.
Somehow show in the chain that cron is active, so when browsing we can immediately know the status and history of executions.

When can we start using the platform for ourselves, so no more platform work needs be done ?

The spec for the platform should be reconciled by AI on the platform.
Testing for NL config should be on platform.
Writing code for the platform should be little AI tested nuggets on the platform.

The big trick seems to be running useEffect with streaming results coming in and readable by the client.

Might not need useEffect if we can break down the AI to be not an endless loop.

If the side effect ran and then ended, no need to add the useEffect functionality.

But if we did have side effect ability, we could
