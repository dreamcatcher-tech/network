When considering handling the medical system and medical insurance, have a list of things that need to be done, and comms that need to be done conditionally, so we can load up all these things ahead of time, and the process just executes with updates.

Let other people control this plan, so a specialized user knows what to do differently or specially, so for $5 they might line up a plan that gives you $1,000 benefits that you didn't know about.
