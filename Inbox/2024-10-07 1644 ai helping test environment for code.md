Make a testing framework designed specifically for an AI to help to focus it down using context window limitations. So there would be a traditional test and that single test would be extracted out and be able to be focused for the AI so it can run it and fix a particular file to make that one test pass. Now it may also need to read in the whole rest of the test but we only need to focus on the test one at a time so it should be able to command the tool to focus on a specific test and then loop on it until it passes and only when it's ready will it try and run the whole suite.

Making a place that AI can run code effectively seems  a big useful thing.

Having very light weight git and letting it roll back and forth seems to help a lot.
