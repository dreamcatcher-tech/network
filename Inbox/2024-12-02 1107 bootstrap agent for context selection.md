Bootstrap Agent.

When selecting an agent, we can:
- start each agent with a context selecting ability
- have an agent that specialized in setting up initia contexts, and managing the short list of agents

Basically if every area of the UI that asked for some user attention / thinking, then it should be managed by an agent.

This is the tool that manages the list of agents and the default agent that gets selected.
