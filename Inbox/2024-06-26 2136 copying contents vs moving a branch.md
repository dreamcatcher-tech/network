What is really the different between just creating a new branch and doing a PR against it, vs gymnastics around ref pointers ?

If the branch is part of the same repo, then we can do a straight merge of it.

We might leave a redirect so that if someone tries to address the branch and its gone, they would get repointed ?  Painful as keeps a lot of old data around.
May store in a single file at the base ?

Moved would probably need to notify any outstanding actions, or leave a pointer until the outstanding actions are resolved.
