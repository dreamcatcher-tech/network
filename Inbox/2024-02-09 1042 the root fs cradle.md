If we ran all of artifact as a side effect in a cradle, then artifact would have some access to the root fs.

Should this be a git repo, and should action that artifact gets asked to do actually be a git commit ?

Is this the same as the special homeslice repo in github ?

In deploy, this is the core repo.
