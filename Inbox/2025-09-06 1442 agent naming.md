it is quite annoying to have to look up an agents name by walking the metadata all the time.

we could use --- to mean a / ?

but that makes it hard to move whole agents around.

at boot and then on face start is when we would update the names ?

there seems several places where watching for a top level config commit is useful:
- the path to this agent
- ?
