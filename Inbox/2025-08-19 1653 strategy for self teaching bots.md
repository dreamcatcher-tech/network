if we let it have it raw, it will almost certainly thrash.  But if we make it come up with a strategy, and have a structured way to measure improvement, and tell it to incrementally try make improvements, then it can begin some kind of ordered study to try get things to be better.

developing a strategy might be the thing that the bots should have to do first ?

give it some easy timeouts, where if it isn't getting anywhere in a certain time, then try make a strategy ?

or, start the strategy discovery in parallel, and start running it anyway.

they can make several strategies, and they can reflect upon the strategy that they just ran.
