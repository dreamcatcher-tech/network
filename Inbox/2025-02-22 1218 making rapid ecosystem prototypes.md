Defining the rules of how the [[2025-02-22 0825 raytio|Raytio]] ecosystem works, we should be able to define different types of capability that we want to introduce.

- HIPAA compliant customer data management
- Gain customer trust
- marketplace for compatible services
- working with un-raytio'd businesses, where the customer is in control

These capabilities would have a recommended way of using the physics of the raytio system, and could have some reasearch attached about yield, market size.

We can say then, with these primitive pieces, this is how we approach the features we want.

Can do test marketing where we see if people sign up to the offering we are making.

Each time we create a new one, we have a process, where it checks that the arrangements of primitives are correct, then it goes and builds out copy and websites to show each configuration.

Things like trusted execution, customer data repos.

Define physics like, the hoster to hoster transfer of the private repo, split hosting with some things on one provider, and others on another, presented to the user seamlessly, and redundant hosting where multiple providers operate in lockstep.

Proposing a scenario would show an existing arrangement, or create a new one.  Or update the phsyics.  Asking quesions like this would show which product was most suitable.

So we would reason thru the ecosystem modelling, and then use this as the basis for service / offering construction.

Each feature would be its own project, and its own justification for existence.

We should be able to generate reactflow stories, that explain how the situation gets built up, step by step, which as a format, could also be used to generate slide decks.
Can have some text explaining the situation next to it.

Could provide multi step stories where the next action can be selected, so the story is multi part.

The problem isn't just data silos, thats the symptom, the problem is coordinate silos, which is wasted energy, lost innovation, higher prices, slower response.  The symptoms of this are lack of digital transformation, slow change in day to day life.  It isn't obvious, but these steady state failings occur from settling on a state of mistrust between businesses, due to destructive competition.  A higher view of how this plays out helps everyone reach a better level of operations.

We should be able to generate sequence diagrams, as show trade flows easily, with rule checkers that make sure everything makes sense.

Once these flows are established, then we can take estimates of the value provided, and show the old way of doing things.

Use something like ameriorate https://ameliorate.app/keyserj/mta-congestion-pricing?view=All+Structure but use AI to update the diagrams and do reasoning on them.  If chats were transformed into this data structure, then derivations would be significantly better, rather than working in unstructured text.
