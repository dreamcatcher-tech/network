Defining the rules of how the [[2025-02-22 0825 raytio|Raytio]] ecosystem works, we should be able to define different types of capability that we want to introduce.

- HIPAA compliant customer data management
- Gain customer trust
- marketplace for compatible services
- working with un-raytio'd businesses, where the customer is in control

These capabilities would have a recommended way of using the physics of the raytio system, and could have some reasearch attached about yield, market size.

We can say then, with these primitive pieces, this is how we approach the features we want.

Can do test marketing where we see if people sign up to the offering we are making.

Each time we create a new one, we have a process, where it checks that the arrangements of primitives are correct, then it goes and builds out copy and websites to show each configuration.

Things like trusted execution, customer data repos.

Define physics like, the hoster to hoster transfer of the private repo, split hosting with some things on one provider, and others on another, presented to the user seamlessly, and redundant hosting where multiple providers operate in lockstep.

Proposing a scenario would show an existing arrangement, or create a new one.  Or update the phsyics.  Asking quesions like this would show which product was most suitable.

So we would reason thru the ecosystem modelling, and then use this as the basis for service / offering construction.
