We could make a pool of NFTs that smooths out the value of each individual one, and so the pool can act as an intelligent proxy, integrated with ambient attribution, to allocate back to the pool holders and to the NFT holders.

The pool buys nfts for a calculated price.
People can buy in to the pool for cash.
When royalties are earned for the NFTs, they go to the whole pool.
Shares of the pool can act like a stablecoin currency that also goes up.
People who stake the NFTs get rewarded for doing so.

Can take a loan out against the future value of your nfts.
