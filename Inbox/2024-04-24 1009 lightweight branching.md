If replies occured and no file changes were made, and there were no steps in the io file, then we shouldn't need to do a commit at all, but should just go straight back to pool ?

Verification of how you got somewhere can be just as important in where you got to, since the chance of errors is lower if steps were taken, also revival is quicker, since less processing to be done to catch up.
