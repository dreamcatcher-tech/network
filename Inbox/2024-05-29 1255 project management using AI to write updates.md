Generating custom updates based on preferred comms styles of participants, accumulating knowledge from multiple sources, summarizing long emails.

Provide a link to each person to tap into the AI project directly, rather than purely via email.

Generate update emails rapidly, with humour, and relevancy.

Trigger when updates are required by keeping a model of what each person knows, needs to know, so that when something changes they are notified correctly.

Trigger change control requests.

Track what critical information was stated when, keep track of expectations too - as in predictions and likelihoods.  Track others on their statements too.

Have a predictions market where the AI places bets, but humans can place bets too.

Stakeholders can indicate what they are interested in, and state their goals.  Then progress towards these goals can be evaluated any time there is new comms.  So when a vendor agrees to make a software change, then this would indicate progress towards a specific goal.  This is done in the heads of all participants normally.  Throw up a red flag when something bad happens towards a goal.

Handle change control requests using AI.  Can be for change of project scope, or can be for changes within an IT environment.  Requiring information for change control is definitely an AI based task.
