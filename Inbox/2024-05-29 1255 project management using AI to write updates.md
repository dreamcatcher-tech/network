Generating custom updates based on preferred comms styles of participants, accumulating knowledge from multiple sources, summarizing long emails.

Provide a link to each person to tap into the AI project directly, rather than purely via email.

Generate update emails rapidly, with humour, and relevancy.

Trigger when updates are required by keeping a model of what each person knows, needs to know, so that when something changes they are notified correctly.

Trigger change control requests.
