Be able to share a prompt thread, and then let people fork by injecting their own prompts at some point in the thread, merging in other threads, which loads up the model with the other threads string of prompts and responses.

Means you could make an "app" by loading up the LLM with a bunch of prior knowledge, and then letting people interact with this checkpoint, such as recomposing all elements of a product offering, and experimenting with how the naming should go, ensuring there are no collisions of words, extracting a dictionary of non trivial terms.
