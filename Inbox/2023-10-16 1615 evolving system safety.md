In a system that can reprogram itself, we need a way to gracefully step off and go back to manual forms.

With an AI, if you do not have a system underneath that is inherently operable by humans, then you rely too much on the AI, and on the net connection.

So to allow a system to make modifications to itself with strict checking (like every other time it ever did that function) and not have errors, we need a blockchain substrate.

The blockchain app is the product of the AI.
