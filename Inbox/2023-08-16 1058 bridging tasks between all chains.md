If we had a central chain of our own, then we could combine all the chains to represent a virtual asset, where each chain with assets could treat each task independently.

So the QA contract could be replicated on all the different chains ?

If the QA was really about signing the content of a header, then it can be chain agnostic.

So a task can be bridged between chains, and a single QA action can resolve them all, allowing assets from multiple chains to be staked against them.
