if they call this tool, then a separate llm will watch the things they mentioned, and then decide if it is time to generate an event.

this can handle cron jobs too.

takes the burden off the running bot to be able to figure all this stuff out, instead it just announces its intent, and the background system whirs away to produce the outcome.
