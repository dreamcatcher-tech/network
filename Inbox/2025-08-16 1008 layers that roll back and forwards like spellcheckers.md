if you have something that does a pass to make sure things are in uk english, then when the bot gets asked to work on the next step, it might be better to let it process in the unprocessed form, so the layers are sort of 'held' between chats, so that each bot sees is own previous output.

So the bot could be thinking in german but presenting in spanish.

this is good because multiple people might be running the same trusted bot, but they need it presented in different layers.
