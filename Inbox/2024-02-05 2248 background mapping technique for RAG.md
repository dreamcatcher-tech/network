If we are continually trying to build up a model that we have already vetted using a high grade LLM while a lowgrade LLM does exactly what was asked, we can offer insights that come out of band.

Out of band means that the machine will realize something at some random date and interupt, rather than only be turn based.  This is how human brains work.
