Currently the pierce system requires the isolate do many round trips with the db, which might be far away.

Instead if we simply wrote the pierce object to the queue, and then laid watch to a key that got updated once the pierce was ingested, the overall process might be significantly faster.

We could use this same method to update replies to a piece when they are done, which means we can purge the `io.json` instantly, and then just write the object that was the reply to the db, with a timeout of like 15 minutes.

We might then be able to remove the difference between a pierce action inside the io.json and so we only have one kind of Request object.

A piece would just simply have no further transmission required, as the origin would the external world, and something else will handle that.

Browser can store its pierce ids locally, and resume them on refresh.  Or not really care, since we don't actually make any use of the result of the pierce anyway.

This same action would be used to cancel and to bill against.

Pierce might then be just part of pooling again, since we don't care about it being separate and faster any more, since it can be just another action in the pool.

We could run the pooling of pierce separately, since the perf gains of merging seem small but the programmatic complexity is large.
