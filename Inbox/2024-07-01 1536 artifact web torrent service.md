Run artifact on a seedbox.
provide updates to artifact of the progress of the file.

Allow streaming to the browser.  
Can just play the video directly inside the stateboard, do casting, and other things.

If we had an app on chromecast or on android tvs, then we could control this tv from artifact, which means it can be told to display things based on ai happening on the cloud.  This can include playing movies and other things, can include receiving audio to transcribe, or can show notifications.

Let the AI navigate popular torrent sites and find several versions, then start streaming.
Charge for bandwidth usage elastically.

Provide a plex server where the filesystem is virtualized, so the base rental of plex is low, and files are charged elastically.

Ai used to help you search for things.


In our tools, you should be able to script browser scraping automatically.

Hopefully we can run our own testing scripts using the browserbase scraper.

Have a teach mode where you click on things in the live page, and we record this and try to run it automatically.  Show the results of the automation in stateboard.

This should be the only way that browsing is done in an org, since we capture everything for reference.

Build up summaries and ratings of movies by scraping various dbs around the place, so the user is presented with a nice selection of screenshots, info, and trailers.
AI can decide to download something for you that it thinks you will like.
Download the first 10 minutes or so, then you can start watching while it fetches the rest.
