If everything is a json function, then we should be able to manage authorization inside the json object calls, and not require anything special like auth headers or a separate auth system.

Idea is that we shouldn't need a web server for any of this, and the process should be identical to into repo comms.

Might need a level squasher, that takes cookies and pushes them down a level on the server side.

So the jsonfunction would expect a level squashed action, and it then does the auth checking stuff ?
