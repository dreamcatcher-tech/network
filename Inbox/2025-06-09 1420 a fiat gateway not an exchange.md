If we simply ran a service where you could put cash in an out of the system, but all the trading was done using defi or on chain.

AI tooling helps you make smart decisions, and guides you in how to achieve whatever your goals are.

We run the tooling for you in a secure enclave like setting.

We can run tracing and cleaning tools in the same interface we give you, so you can know if your money is dirty, so we have no difference between the tools we give our customers and the tools we use ourselves.

We have localized banking features, and we may do some payment options.

Our core is, kyc which is an unbundled service that other apps can take advantage of, and can sell assurance as an insurance thing, where you get cover if we haven't done our job right, so we manage the risk like an insurance actuary.

We might offer local banking accounts that you can control globally like how wise does.  But the key is a standard interface for fiat.

Then we can allow p2p trading and money transmission using these same components.
