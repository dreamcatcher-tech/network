With a router like a cd laser head, and a reference plate up top that it slides over, we can make highly accurate cuts using crude positioning equipment, with the smarts being in the router head.

using the work surface as a reference map is hard, but having a plate up above that is used to take camera based measurement off might give better results ?

On workpiece is best, and perhaps a paint or sticker system works best.

Make a metrology frame that is separate from the positioning frame.  This uses flat plates and camera markings but carries no load.  The device positions itself based on this frame.

Could be a metrology arm with 6 axis freedom, internal and protected sensors, joints rather than sliding guides.  The arm can be used to do direct metrology checking too, not just tool guidance.

Even a human can position the tool, rather than a robot.

The folly of most designs is merging the metrology frame with the positioning frame.
