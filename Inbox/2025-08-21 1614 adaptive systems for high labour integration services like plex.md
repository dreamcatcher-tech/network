something like plex has high integration cost since all the various files people try, each causes errors and people want them fixed.

If we could trigger ai healers to try find the problem and push the fix, then we could quickly have very few problems, but as things change in the future, we gain reputation as bieng the fastest to respond, so things are hardly ever broken.

we can host your video server for you, or you can do it yourself.

you pay us, the hoster, and then we run whatever apps you tell us to, with privacy.

services can be set up outside the hoster that route traffic, like a vpn.

so basically we can have systems that are typically very expensive to build, but we do them cheap because we do them adaptive.

plex could be done to share the transcoding amongst hundreds of users, like a global network.
we wouldn't be selling plex, we just sell compute, and people run their own apps, which can find each other.
peoples agents crawl the hash space and try find friends for me.
