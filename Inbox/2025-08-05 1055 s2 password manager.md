runs online, but its your repo.
you can see all the changes to the repo, including login audits.
can set up with a team, so that the team can pull down offline copies of the vault.
or, can only allow one password per person.

insert LLM gatekeepers that check if it is reasonable for this person to get this cred at this time.

use a browser extension so it does auto fill, and only auto fill, so you can't copy the actual passwords.

you can move your vault across different hosts, keep a copy locally.

the extension can be configured to act as a local node, so it stores it on disk, offline.

store a version on your phone.

pay for hosting, pay for usage, pay for security checks.

the secrets vault can be used by mcp servers to get special secrets data on demand, so it is a machine vault as well as a human vault - an agent vault of sorts.

can do some extra features, like holding the relationship with the service.

have some way that the decryption keys of a user are stored on their computer with the extension, and on their phone, and against a cold storage wallet that we can open up but only after some time.

if you provide kyc info to us, we can use that to unlock your account if you want.

AI guidance can have an opinion on the veracity of the site, and can kick off warnings if you're in the wrong place.  Or can comment on the side about things, plus can be asked questions.

AI can be passed back key info about the fields that are being filled in, and can auto place the auto fill boxes based on the dom, since it should be able to read the pages quite well.  Should make it easier than coding for detection.  Plus grab a bunch of examples.  Plus track the user login patterns so it knows what to type in and which boxes, then it averages this info out between all the users without sharing any other info about them.

Just means we stay always current but without much coding.
