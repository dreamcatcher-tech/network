runs online, but its your repo.
you can see all the changes to the repo, including login audits.
can set up with a team, so that the team can pull down offline copies of the vault.
or, can only allow one password per person.

insert LLM gatekeepers that check if it is reasonable for this person to get this cred at this time.

use a browser extension so it does auto fill, and only auto fill, so you can't copy the actual passwords.

you can move your vault across different hosts, keep a copy locally.

the extension can be configured to act as a local node, so it stores it on disk, offline.

store a version on your phone.

pay for hosting, pay for usage, pay for security checks.

the secrets vault can be used by mcp servers to get special secrets data on demand, so it is a machine vault as well as a human vault - an agent vault of sorts.

can do some extra features, like holding the relationship with the service.
