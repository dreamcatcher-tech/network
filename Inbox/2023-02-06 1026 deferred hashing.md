Replace hashes with a variable that can be fulfilled later, possibly using a different thread.
Can make testing faster as deployment should be nearly instantaneous.

Trace the engine execution by engine operations by filesystem path.
So a gantt chart that can be folded and expanded by filesystem path.

Make some tooling to help debug apps, but use that same tooling to debug the engine operations.

Idea is to make a test harness that can run the reducers at raw speed, without all the block interactions that we suspect slows the engine down.
