And so as you're coding, you kind of want to be able to have a constant audio stream going that's just, uh, picking up what you're saying. And then the background tasks are working away on that. Like, for example, I might be using an implementation of an interface that I just made, and then I start making notes on things that need to change or be documented in the interface or prompts. I want to ask, like, hey, you know, how can I change this interface to explain without having to ask what this feature I want is? So those would be questions that I want the AI to answer or do. And so while I'm working in this reasoning workbench, I should be able to you know, have and watch these background tasks work that are working preemptively, just speculatively, trying different things. Sometimes the result comes back and they look at it and go, yeah, that's actually, looks like it would be progress right now. So really I'm just looking at the code twiddling at the code. I've got a live audio stream going. And then in the background, every time I do something, plus as the grinding progresses, sometimes changes will appear and there'll be multiple different types of changes. I can select from an option and then talk about those options. And then, yeah, this is like a more fluid way to process a file.
