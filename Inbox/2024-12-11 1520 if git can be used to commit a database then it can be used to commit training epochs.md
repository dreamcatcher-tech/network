These epochs can be sold and paid for, and the work done verified using spot checks, comparisons.

Symetric proof of work means that the work has no shortcut, and so concurrent executions is the only way to check it.

The concurrency gives redundancy, but it is costly.  Spot checking and staking  of assets and reputation amplify this more.
