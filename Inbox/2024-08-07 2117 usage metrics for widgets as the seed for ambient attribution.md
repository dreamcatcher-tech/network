When a widget gets loaded from a library and used, the usage info gets shared and the value creation is decided upon by ambient attribution.  Then incentives are automatically generated and published where the AI says what it thinks you should build next, and how much it will be worth in varying projection scenarios.

Widgets can include agents, and so long as we keep their threads constrained and hidden, they can be loaded up remotely.

Widgets must be pretested - they can be configurable, but they must be pre generated, else the error rate is too high.
