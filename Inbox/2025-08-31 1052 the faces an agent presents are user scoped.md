it can have users inside the system, representing different entities that are communicating with it, with different permission levels.

root is top level.

but that might be committing a crime, where we have nested too much inside - it should be different users have a totally different agent ?

like if you provide multi user at two different levels - the agent level and inside the agent - then you have multiplied the confusionw ithin the system since there are now multiple ways to get any single thing done.
