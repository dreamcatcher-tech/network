we can present a simple pipeline for the calculation of fairness.

for any given scene, consider only the information that is on chain.

reduce this down to atoms - assertions.  check each one, reduce conflicts, and assign a probability score to each one.

identify all the entities that need to be allocated on based on the project information.

figure out what code paths run for the current value, which could be aggregated.

walk backwards to find how those paths came to be.
