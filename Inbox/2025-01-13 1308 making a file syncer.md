We should be able to use the moneyworks syncer to sync local files up and down to backblaze.

Then we can stop using several services that we pay for, like mega, and others, and then sell these services as our own, plus let people improve them using the artifact generative AI tooling, as well as sharing revenue for when people use the improvements.

Then make a version of pm2 so that we can manage what napps run locally, and get feedback to a live dashboard.

Allow you to run any napp as a service on a local machine.

The artifact api can be made to point to the local filesystem, it just errors when you ask for history, UNLESS it finds itself inside of a git repo AND it has permission.
