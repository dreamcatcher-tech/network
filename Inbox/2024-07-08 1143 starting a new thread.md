By default backchat should start a default thread, unless told otherwise.

That thread is what would be focused.

Scoping a threads file access is done at the branch level, not within the thread file itself.

Remotes could be in their own folders, so that all the threads backchat needs to concern itself with are in one structure.

If we copy the remote session file in directly, then we can't hold its reference
Unless every thread holds its owning item internally ?
