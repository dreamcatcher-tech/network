Our data structure can easily go offline, and possible a form of consensus mechanism without complex dispute resolution can be offline too.

So whilst we are hooked up to AI, we can do the full capabilities, but while offline, we can do some basic operations, like retrieve items, search, edit, pull from others, see what others are doing.

This should allow a warehouse to keep functioning even with loss of power.
