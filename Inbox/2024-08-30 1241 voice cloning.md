Use https://www.resemble.ai/ to be able to find out which speakers were in which audio samples, to automatically categorize them.

Can use to fill in the gaps on video or voice calls, so a text stream can be sent, as well as having some filler information go in if there is a voice delay.

Means that with multipath text being transferred we can still keep the conversation fluid.

Would need a way to use lambda or other functions to do heavy lifting of compute.
