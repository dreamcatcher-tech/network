we could make the tree store the names and the indexes of a big list which holds the actual contents.  The list holds backpointers to the map, so if we want to delete by index, this is possible ?

We could make an object that creates an array lazily, so we never scroll if it has cached a value already it will return it. 

This is an issue though, when the map has changed because items may have been inserted within it. 

However, we do have OIDs on our side.
