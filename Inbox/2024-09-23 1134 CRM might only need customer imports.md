If we write a tool that watches the moneyworks database and imports the customers, then we can deliver some value to the trucking guys.

Seems useful before we can write back changes, too.

After writing back changes to the db, the next most useful thing becomes the banking processing.

Processing emails seems next best ?
If these can be drafted and generated ?

We should drive to get this connection working, since it establishes us on their premises.
