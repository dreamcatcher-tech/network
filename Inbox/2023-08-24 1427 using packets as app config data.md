For example, the list of whitelisted tokens could be modelled as a packet that receives a new solution each time someone wants a new addition made.  Other packets would have been required that check the code of the token in question.  Then gas and qa feeds get paid to update the solution to the overall packet.  Then, browsers use the latest solution to get the whitelists in a decentralized way.

If we have a gen3 blockchain, then we can trigger web2.0 actions based on gen2 blockchains, and they would be reliable and unstoppable, like if an eth contract confirmed a pull request should be merged, then the gen3 would do the actual merge.

It would either call github using encrypted shared credentials, or it would run the git repo on chain and do the merge there.
