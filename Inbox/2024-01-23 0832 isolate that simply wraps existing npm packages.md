All that would be needed is to generate an API for it, then run a bot with this API put inside it, where the bot knows about npm packages, and knows how to craft its parameters.

So it would turn the package interface into NL.

It would have predigested the readme, and scoured the source code, taking notes as it went, and reconciling everything to get a solid idea of the system.  It would have run coverage tests, and as usage increased it would see what usage triggered what coverage, and it would have then set about making an optimised package with smaller dependencies that could do the same job modularly.

Using typescript it would know what parameter types were required.
