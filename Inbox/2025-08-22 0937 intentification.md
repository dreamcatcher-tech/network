Maybe we can simplify the model even further, where it just has one function, which is where it summarizes cleanly the intent it has, and makes a request to a function that then uses many parallel agents to get the best response ?

It can return a quick response, and longer more considered responses.

the model can come back with further questions, using the ellicitation system, which should be seen as intent clarifications.
