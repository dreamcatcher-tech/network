Maybe we can simplify the model even further, where it just has one function, which is where it summarizes cleanly the intent it has, and makes a request to a function that then uses many parallel agents to get the best response ?

It can return a quick response, and longer more considered responses.

the model can come back with further questions, using the ellicitation system, which should be seen as intent clarifications.

the universal agent excels at orchestration - calling on bots to do jobs for it, and it knows how to ask for agents to be created, and knows how to get them tested.

This self improvement side means it can ask for its underlying things to be improved, and it can decide to enact an upgrade for itself, or pass the job off to someone who does.

So it just knows how to use different groups of tooling, where it passes fuzzy intent out each time.

job doing, agent creation, agent improvement.

these key features are pillars of the platform, and we work on getting each area better, but the core agents stay largely the same.

core agents know about keeping jobs on the go, handling multiple requests in parallel from the human, and restarting jobs on completion.
