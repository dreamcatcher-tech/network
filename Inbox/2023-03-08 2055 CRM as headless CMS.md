[Headless CMS](https://www.storyblok.com/lp/developers) systems seem to be popular - we could make one of these using our tooling

Could make it a distributed CMS.

Content loads chains, so the page is static and rarely published.
Chains also control the react bundle that gets loaded.
Could also choose to upgrade the engine - use a pinned version to load a pulse that tells it to update to a later engine, then boot that.

Means the content can be provided by multiple parties, not just a single flat group.
Can give departments control over their particular part.
Share CMS modules between companies for the exact same product.
