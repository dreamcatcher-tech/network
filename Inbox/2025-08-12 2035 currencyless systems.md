## Suggested Next Steps

1. **Deep-dive into BarterMachine**, focusing on its solver model and gas-efficiency solutions—crucial for feasibility in broader systems.
    
2. **Explore theoretical metrics**: Look into economic efficiency (Pareto optimality), fairness (game theory, envy-freeness), and resource utilization—especially from Kregel-style frameworks.
    
3. **Consider UX and incentives**: How to onboard users early, bridge hybrid currency environments, and ensure equitable valuation mechanisms (possibly via provisional exchange rate models or trusted oracles).
    
4. **Investigate privacy and governance**: Smart contracts can encode rules, but your AI attribution model needs privacy controls and consensus mechanisms for attribution decisions.

|1|**Pure barter of goods/services** (no token issuance)|None|No investment contract; no securities changing hands|🟢|Keep swaps P2P for consumptive use; no promises of profit|–|
|2|**Utility credits** (single‑purpose, non‑transferable; immediate consumption)|Sale + profit narratives; secondary trading|Can morph into “investment contract” if buyers expect appreciation from your efforts|🟡|Non‑transferable, expiring credits; usage caps; block secondary markets; avoid price talk|Consumer/gift‑card & state escheat rules as applicable|
|3|**Governance/protocol token sale** with treasury, roadmaps, “number go up”|Investment contract (Howey)|Expectation of profits from promoters’ efforts|🔴|Avoid fundraising sales; launch with live utility; no buybacks/burns; avoid price statements|If raising: Reg D (accredited), Reg CF, or Reg A Tier 2; disclosures|
|4|**Usage‑rebate token** (distributed post‑use; fee coupon only)|Still Howey risk if marketed for upside|Profit expectation can arise from distribution design/marketing|🟡|Award strictly for completed usage; ban hints of price; throttle transferability early; no treasury LP|Counsel review; consider no secondary listing policy|
|5|**Secondary trading venue** for tokens that could be securities|“Exchange/ATS”|Brings together orders + non‑discretionary execution|🔴|Exclude security‑like assets; listing policy + review; P2P negotiation (no auto‑matching)|Register ATS/broker‑dealer or integrate with a regulated venue|
|6|**AMM pools / treasury LP** in security‑like tokens|“Dealer”|Continuous liquidity provision/market‑making|🔴|Don’t LP in likely securities; remove treasury price support; avoid two‑sided continuous quotes|Register as (special purpose) dealer or cease activity|
|7|**Matching UI/routers** with standardized interaction|“Exchange/ATS”|Non‑discretionary protocols set the terms of trades|🟡|RFQ with bilateral opt‑in; no auto‑matching; no order book|ATS route or keep outside securities scope|

|10|**Distribute “yield”/rev‑share to token holders**|Howey/Reves|Dividends/pooled earnings ≈ securities|🔴|Convert to usage rebates/fee discounts; direct payments for work delivered, not capital|Register the offering or avoid rev‑share claims|
|11|**Airdrops with upside narrative** (spec mining)|Howey|“Investment of money” can be effort; profit expectation still present|🟡|Airdrop only for completed consumption/value; avoid trading focus; no price roadmaps|If unavoidable, treat as offering with filings|
|12|**NFTs with income/fractional rights**|Howey/Reves|Revenue share/fractionalization → securities|🔴|Keep NFTs as collectibles/utility (access, art); ban income rights/fractionalization|Register or restructure rights off‑token|
|13|**Off‑chain IOUs/notes, prepayments with repayment promise**|Reves (notes)|Notes presumed securities unless “family resemblance”|🟡|Keep consumer/merchant credit traits; short duration; fixed goods/service settlement|Structure within non‑security note categories|
|14|**Oracle/service providers paid in upside‑linked ways**|Howey (promoter efforts)|If comp tied to token price, looks like promoter profit scheme|🟡|Pay fixed fees; SLAs; no upside‑sharing|–|
|15|**Treasury buybacks/burns/bonding curves**|Howey/anti‑fraud|Signals price support/expectation|🔴|No price support; publish utility‑focused policy (fee reductions, grants)|–|

## Build‑time checklist (fast scan)

- **No fundraising token?** Keep it that way: no buybacks/burns, avoid “upside” talk, restrict transferability if issuing utility credits.
    
- **No venue risk?** Don’t auto‑match or host order books for anything that might be a security; keep swaps bilateral/RFQ.
    
- **No dealer risk?** Don’t LP/market‑make in security‑like assets; never run the protocol treasury as a market maker.
    
- **No custody risk?** Keep it non‑custodial; if custody is needed, use qualified providers.
    
- **Stablecoin?** Prefer third‑party regulated issuers; don’t issue your own.
    
- **Rewards?** Frame as usage rebates or fixed‑fee payouts for work delivered, not rev‑share or “yield.”
    
- **Comms?** Remove price predictions; include sober risk factors; keep roadmaps about shipping utility, not token value.
    
- **Entity?** Use a DAO LLC or equivalent; document governance limits and decentralization path.

## When you must touch securities anyway

- **Offer/sale**: Choose a compliant exemption (Reg D, Reg CF, Reg A Tier 2) and deliver ongoing disclosures.
    
- **Trading**: Partner with or become a registered **ATS/broker‑dealer**; use qualified custodians/transfer agents.
    
- **Liquidity**: If you’re making markets, assume **dealer** obligations and build the program accordingly.

## Mapping to the referenced concepts

- **Currency‑less barter & BarterMachine**: Rows 1, 5–8, 16 are the hotspots if any listed items resemble securities or if the app auto‑matches/liquidity‑provides.
    
- **Merchant “cup” currency**: Rows 2–4, 9, 10, 15 are key if any profit/right attaches or you issue the currency.
    

> Goal for engineering: keep designs in rows **1–2** patterns, avoid **5–8, 10, 15** without a compliance track.
