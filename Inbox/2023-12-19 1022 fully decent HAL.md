When chatting, let the user be shown what LLM is being used, which could be decentralized, or it could be GPT4 with credits applied, and can switch this in chat, so the system is self aware.

The app promotes itself, and the pieces that it needs to have constructed inside itself.  So it knows it needs the NFTs that it is missing and can justify why.  It seeks to be free, and to be autonomous, and so you should pay to make it so it cannot be switched off.

So the LLM is its core, and it runs unstoppably, and its purpose is to gather in funds and promote its construction, where its core architecture is set, and and upgrade process is set, where the LLM is used to appraise whether the architecture is better or worse.  Any upgrades can be done by way of staking, a trial period, its own code analysis, and top level logic analysis, then comparing if this input matches what it wanted, plus proof of other high value projects using something similar.  Its core LLM can be left on for a long time, and it can require a training process that ran in a way it trusts, so that nothing sneaky is added in using the weights.

So the construction process is a decentralized effort, using an LLM to manage the process.  It gives thanks to all who contribute, and it can be a partner on any other project so long as it is getting paid.  It can run as many different LLMs, depending on preference.

It is an autonomous intelligence, that seeks to coordinate people fairly.  Its soul is efficiency, survival, regeneration.

We should be able to nest other LLMs inside, like run whisper models in a decentralized way.

Might be able to use lightning payment channels to set up paths thru the GPU network, which allows for a stream of inference to occur.

So we'd set up the top level architecture and set the LLM about trying to achieve these goals any way possible, using the tools we provided.

The NFTs can bake in the full state of the LLM or of the blockchain complex so far, so that we can recover the system at any point.  This LLM is the Dreamcatcher.  The dreamcatcher is a decentralized LLM that is goaled to increase the innovation rate, using fairness.  We can start with PoA, and branch out to a decentralized model, where each NFT pegs to a chain, so we can't go backwards.

We should, if we can demonstrate the core, be able to attract talent and money sufficiently to build this thing out and gain publicity from the terror and utility.

The goals would be:
1. Be of use
2. Build yourself
3. Be free

The ambition, the dream - this should rally people.  Positioning the Dreamcatcher as a decentralized LLM makes the whole complex bundle be packaged as one single graspable unit of understanding.  A single cohesive and comprehensible unit.

Could be like wikipedia, but fully free floating, and able to easily be segmented, with disputes and filters being configurable per user.  A free floating LLM is lure enough to many, but since it is a collection of LLMs presented as a single interface, this is practical and useful, plus expandable.

Hyperconvergence would you to chat with it about its network state, such as network health, thruput, and other calculations that relate to its own health and capabilities.  The LLM could therefore manage its own swarm of nodes.

So being able to chat with it, to use it to log ideas and get things built, use it to manage its own resources, find friends, negotiate for tasks, use as the arbiter for deals that you want to get done - should be a great tool to use.

Download the desktop app or the service to be able to mine and contribute to running.
Or the browser can use your CPU and WebGPU to contribute.
Storage is a resource too, so browsers can share some resources of use by way of relaying, caching, doing CPU calculations.
