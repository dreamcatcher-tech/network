We should link a service where applications can make api calls that go through a gateway of ours that acts as an attestation service. So our services link the call and then return back the results of the call plus an attestation. This can be used for services that are not providing their own attestations to prove to anyone who wants to inspect it that indeed these calls legitimately came from a service that expects this would be in the form of a java script web token. 

reproducibility is still the best way.

so we could use an enclave, and use attestations on the whole process being run by trusted hardware, which means it verified the ssl certs matched, and ran the code as intended, which is probably about as good as things get.

we could make a public verification endpoint, where anyone can submit text and we can return a yes or not as to whether it was generated by one of our endpoints.  Can optionally, if the caller allowed it, expose more details, like timestamps and other metadata.

Our ambient attribution rules should contain a compact 'tear off' proof that the calls did indeed go via the model provider that is cited.
