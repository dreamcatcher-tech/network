Sometimes when a task completes, we need some more information to carry on a workflow - how should this be represented in the cli ?

Almost need some kind of flag to indicate the process hasn't completed yet ?

Like a standard reply that needs more info, like a generator ?

Or, for speaker id, just send in a second call that that asks for speaker id.

So the result includes instructional text.  Then, if you call the id speaker again, it will use the existing transcript and will rename everything.
