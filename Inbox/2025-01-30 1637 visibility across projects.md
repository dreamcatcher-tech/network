Currently devs work in isolation, and so they could be hitting the same problems, but wouldn't know if others in their team or round the world were doing the same thing.

Using dreamcatcher, where the branches and prompts of all would be visible, plus overwatch making sure it all stays coordinated, efficiency should be maximum, but we can also get a sense of presence with other people, and we can replay what they have done to learn from them.

A good way to think about AI is that it sort of summarizes what everyone is doing, and so you get this strong sense of common knolwedge.
