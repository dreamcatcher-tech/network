The novelty:
1. Externalizing tasks into discrete units, making their funding and solutions open to anyone
2. Quality controlling both the task definition and the completion attempts
3. Suppressing conversions between assets and labour until valuation info is available
4. Making task shares openly tradeable

Operating in this way, we have a novel blockchain platform that supports AI models natively.
There is a vast number of applications that can be built using this technology.
If we build an AI application that can fairly arbitrate between creativity and assets, then we can achieve two things:
1. Harmoniously coordinate a creative pool of labour and capital, outpacing other networks
2. Fairly take for ourselves a cut of every single opportunity by default, as well as any opportunity we specifically target
