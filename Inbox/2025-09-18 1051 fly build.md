seems easiest to just have a single image, and use the processes to run different files.

one is the nfs server.

or we have a totally separate project that runs the nfs server, name server, and auth.

have two fly.toml files and use two docker files.

this should be separate apps, really.

auth needs dns, surely, since we can't have wildcard names without auth.
