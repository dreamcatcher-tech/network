Let the tests and specs be voted on gradually, rather than a final solution, so discussion moves the vote forwards since the specs are being built out - what it has to do rather than how to do it.

Some of these rules are core, and common to all proposals, and some are in the main proposal.

These are the test of the proposal rather than the src.

If we all agree on what a solution should at least fulfill, that is progress.

if we agree how we will assess any given solution, that is progress.
