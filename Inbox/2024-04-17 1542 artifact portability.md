If run on the Dreamcatcher, which is the cloud version of Artifact, then you should be able to export the dapp to github, pull it down to your local machine, and run using deno which will execute it locally.

Should be able to run in verification mode locally.

Or make your own deployment in deno deploy, to be able to run it independently.

Any two deployments in deno deploy should be able to talk to each other without any confused identity.

This makes it a great platform to easily work on and publish AI related work due to cloud convenience and massive parallelism, but also due to portability and sovereignty of your data.
