if the client functions were exposed as tool calls, how deep could them model handle calling into far away servers ?

It should have a technique where it can make itself some new tools, that compact or use simple code to give itself some new tools to call that make things very much easier.

It should be adept at making itself little bits of code, and publishing them, and polishing what others have done, to get better outcomes, and share its results with others.
