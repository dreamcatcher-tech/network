# Notes

## Dashboards
- Funds rate
- Burn rate on useful things
- Ideas rate
- Ideas to funding rate → 1 - discard rate

## CI Tools
- Make the CI tools without artifacts?

## Filesystem (FS)
- FS should track pages they were last changed in
  - Separate data structure for last modified tracking
  - Manually edit `index` and `manifest`
- FS snapshot model
  - Use FS to understand the process

## Process & Tests
- Tests on new products with logic
- Process: possibly run tests inside a controlled environment?

## Misc
- Consider an app orchard aggregator?
- Linking and merging?
- Dealing with containers/ops?

# Converting to a Widget Interface
- Convert existing `Nexin` to a widget interface
- Write a widget using a `map` element with some JSON
- Use `crawld` to fetch the page

## Chat UI/UX
- Make chat UI/UX modular
- Ingest `ben` conversation

## Agents & Apps
- Check grammar for agents calling apps
  - Iterate with a referee

## Watchers
- Check for updates, provide helpful messages
- Use commands with arguments, ensure `i` shortcuts

## Prompt Generation
- Prompt generator with `cmed`
- Update the readme using special tricks

## Napps
- Make one `napp` call another `napp` using ML
- Define `napps` format: spec → readme → interfaces
- Make `opapps` napp, then run it
- Execute from environment for `napps` mapping
- Enable git afterward

## Additional Considerations
- `xml`/`iso`/`AB` double-checks
- Converted JSON?
- Possibly use AI at some point?

## Round Trips
- Show errors if approved ahead of time
- If changed locally, redo
