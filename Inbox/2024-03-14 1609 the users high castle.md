Their bastion on the internet.
A secure enclave for them to store their identity information and passwords.
Other important documents stored here.
Can allow them to be identified to a government grade.

Generates unique email addresses for interactions.
Processes the emails using AI, to handle annoying things for you.
Defends you in cases of poorly behaving merchants.

Seeks offers or better deals for you on the internet.
Helps you browse and find different products.

Should allow multiple identity providers to connect thru us, so you can choose which one you want to use.

Offer merchants insurance for their kyc liabilities.

Merchants have huge friction with their users, deliquents, bad or unverified reviews, cost of making a nice user interface, taking credit card payments.
If we offered our bastion as a way to modernize businesses without strong ecommerce, then we can induct their customers immediately, and sign up new customers to our service.  The users suffer no jarring, since they would be asked to sign up to something anyway.
Once we have this, then we can have multiple services offered thru our network, with choice between users, very low payment processing costs.

Inducting uncooperative merchants, or users - must be able to interact with a merchant better

Advice from agents, like bill reminders, budget forecasters - chat with your budget.
Pull in your bank feeds, and keep them save.


Merchant offerings would be AI appraised, and we'll guide them how to make the best offerings and why - we help them get up to market leading with their offerings using AI tooling.


We should be guest mode only forever if need be - be the least intrusive we possibly can to a user, so show our sincerity.

The economics of good service as credit card processor has changed - used to be easy to speak on the phone to someone and get them to sort out your problems - now not so much.  AI can change that, and restore some of that hand held service.

We should be a merchant in our own service.  If you call us, we can bill you, and then if your call was our fault, you get refunded.

Can offer plugins that can do extra things like budget advice, and whatever else people find useful.  Each piece runs in the same trusted model as the enclave - vendor cannot see user data, vendor gets paid by dreamcatcher.
