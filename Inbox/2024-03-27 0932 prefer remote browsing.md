Ideally, i would never again browse on my local device.  Artifact would read the page, render it, extract the text and images into something nice to consume, provide a summary, store it immutably, compare the stored version with my friends, and send a tip to the authors.

My local bandwidth would never be consumed, the page would render remotely in a complete sandbox, and if I wanted it, I could see a bitmap image of it, modified by ai image recognition to remove the ads.

I could then reference this article when I write, or talk, I could teach my AI that this was a good article and assert it as factual.  It could be nudged towards my friends when they are dealing with things in the vicinity.  I could add notes and interpretations of it.  I can post it on my social feed or make it available to my friends passively since it is something I think is of value.
