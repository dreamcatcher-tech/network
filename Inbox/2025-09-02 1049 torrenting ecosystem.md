All we really need is a vpn box.
then we can do data storage locally using lfs, split between our servers.

android app can expose a full screen media display function, where it can start playing videos.

so we can run our own transcodes in the cloud, and then just play on the little apps we have.

doesn't need much ui since it's just terminal plus full screen mode.
