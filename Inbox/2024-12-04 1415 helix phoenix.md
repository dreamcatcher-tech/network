we always wanted a high compute capacity blockchain.
how we have one, and we have a burning need, which is to run ai agents in a decentralized fashion.

So we could dust off helix, with its blockchain patents, and reinvigorate building a blockchain to run AI agents upon.  Using the dreamcatcher protocol to build out these features.

Then we have good origin, show code progression, demonstrate experience, have patents, have capital raising methods.  Can give the helix people who lost out a chance.

napps are a format for dapps as a single unit.  currently there isn't a single unit.
demo setting up the simplest app, and show what a rigmarole it is.
show how unusable a pure contract is.
Show how napps can bundle all that together, and can maybe also bundle up eth contracts and others, so it can deploy or depend on them.
