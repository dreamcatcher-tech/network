If we detect that an action is overly large, then we should automatically switch, so the user is free to do as they please, and we handle it on the backend.

If the size goes over, we write a temporary binary file, or attach that to the pierce, then reference it in the action.

In the UI, we would favour doing this when copy pasting large text pieces.
