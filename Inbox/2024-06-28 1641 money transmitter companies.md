Specialize in transmitting compressible assets - they have a low value at transmission but can grow into something, like ore concentrates [[2024-06-28 1519 micro refineries for metals]]

Transmit funds where some of those funds goes into investments that stay within the country.

In this way, the funds never left the country, preferential pricing was arranged.

Then over time, those assets increase in value, using something like an index fund or an investment fund. 

So you can first of all pay for goods at a cheaper rate, quicker, but the key is you get the products at a discount since some of the payment is staying in the country of origin, or is entering the country in a compressed state.

Means that suppliers can offer better pricing if they take these additional payment terms.

this would probably require the supplier to get paid in the raw mineral, rather than just the cash.

But a pipeline that used full values between buyers and sellers could be set up, which just dealt in cash, whereas we transfer the ore in, and take advantage of getting our money in as ore, then getting it out as refined minerals.  Then we take profit, and overpay the suppliers in exchange for using us.
