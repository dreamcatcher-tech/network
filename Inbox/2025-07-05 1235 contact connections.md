how should chats that are between multi parties be synchronized ?

contacts list maintainance ?

updates or changes to the contacts ?

discovery of contacts ?


if the contacts are just repo keys, and some info that the repo shared with you, moved by way of transcludes.

finding contacts requires the repos to make their discovery available.
each part could allow their contacts to be browsed, based on honouring the permissions of each repo.
so because the hoster guarantees the correct operation of each private repo, we can guarantee that the friends of friends restriction is honoured.  So discovery is based on the hoster making a public list available, and then each individual sharing their list, so discovery crawls what friends you already have.

we should encrypt or use secrets here so that if a backup gets leaked, it doesn't leak all the friends list automatically.
