A isolate given this command can instruct itself to be called once for each filename in the glob search.

For tests, we would show the file explorer with the paths of all the found files, and we would modify the filter by interacting with the explorer widget.

When we were ready to go, the regex would be passed in as an extra text field, and the model should read that, then call amplify, plus the specific command it was programmed to use.

So when we wrap functions in yaml, amplify is special in that it takes any function and a glob ?
