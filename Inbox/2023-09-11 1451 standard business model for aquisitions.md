make a context diagram that shows a business as a standard physical thing - a diagram.  Lists all money movements, and includes ways to measure different indicators about a business.

Can search using this model, since can specify ranges that you want to search for.

Our plan is to acquire companies that we score well, where we can bring efficiency and innovation to, using pubco as a finance vehicle, then list them on our mini stockmarket.

So we have stock in these companies by way of acquisition, and stock in the stucks we have contributed to, then we also list the company stock that people can buy in or out of too.  Makes the companies immediately liquid, and lets us sell down portions of each one depending on conditions, rather than everything being bundled up in the top level pubco.

Reason is that pubco value is easily demonstrated with existing companies with revenue.  
Also selling software is harder than buying a business.  We can get all of the value we bring, rather than some argued about portion.
We can make org and process changes required to capitalize on our software.  Firing people is too hard for most businesses, and process changes need to be done in a way that leverages the tooling better, requiring intimate knowledge.
We have full insight to these companies to learn from - they would be made completely transparent.
The business will need some new software, and it is hard to learn that from the outside.
