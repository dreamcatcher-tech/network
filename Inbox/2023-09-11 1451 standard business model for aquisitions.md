make a context diagram that shows a business as a standard physical thing - a diagram.  Lists all money movements, and includes ways to measure different indicators about a business.

Can search using this model, since can specify ranges that you want to search for.

Our plan is to acquire companies that we score well, where we can bring efficiency and innovation to, using pubco as a finance vehicle, then list them on our mini stockmarket.

So we have stock in these companies by way of acquisition, and stock in the stucks we have contributed to, then we also list the company stock that people can buy in or out of too.  Makes the companies immediately liquid, and lets us sell down portions of each one depending on conditions, rather than everything being bundled up in the top level pubco.
