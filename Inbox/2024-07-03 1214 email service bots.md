If we agree on a standard data structure, then people can compete to have more useful bots that process this data.

Then have different services that offer to connect the email flows in and out, with different qualities.  

The general messaging format can be agreed on in a text format, and then we can import from different sources, like email, whatsapp, telegram.

These systems can act as backups to and from your individual apps, but can also converse with these apps, or as you, on your behalf.

So have standard message delivery apis, and then have composition bots and connectors to other systems.
