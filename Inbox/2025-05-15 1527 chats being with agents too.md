? should all chats be with agents ?
what are the chats you have with a napp ?
is there any point in having these chats ?

maybe its all just agentic messages ?
agents can have icons and personalities

these bots that you fully own, they should be able to take part in group chats ?

they could have all the mechanics of agents, but they don't have agency, because you trigger them ?

maybe chats is just a subset of messages, like a message thread.

they might be internal agents, rather than external ?
