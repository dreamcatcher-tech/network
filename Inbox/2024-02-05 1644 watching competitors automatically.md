We should be able to present easily a multi dimensional measure of distance away from our competitors in terms of capital, potential to raise, user base, technical feasibility.

Our technical achievements are what we base our revenue goals on, so we should be aware of who else is heating towards what revenue streams, and if they get there, will they be good enough to claim it as their own, at our loss ?

How long until the competition catch up ?  Also consider someone well funded starting from nothing, as well as existing larger teams.  In particular track the labs and the VC arms of large corporates that are in the space.
