We should be able to provide a basic xml file example, and get the LLM to generate arbitrary numbers of files for this, perhaps using the repeater to or some other tool to run this in parallel multiple times.

The LLM would alter the xml with some guaranteed result.

Pass in the index of the run as a way to seed the generation, so that it takes that index and turns it into something.

This napp would be good at generating large amounts of data.  It would have a header agent that interprets the request, and then modifyer apps.
