we need tools that let us conduct long runnings sagas with o1, and where it will attempt to ask deeper questions and generate its own story forks without our doing.

It should be trained based on sagas that it did before that we liked, so it leans towards doing this more.  This might be done with the reasoning fine tuning methods.

So from a simple question, you could come back and several fully implemented codebases, or changes to your existing context, have already been undertaken and just need your approval.

They may have already been published and just await your direct blessing, and may have been used by other agents already.
