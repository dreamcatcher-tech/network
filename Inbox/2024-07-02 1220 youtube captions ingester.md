use the youtube api to pull down captions.
User would go find the youtube video of their choice, and then would load them up, and parse down the captions.

The knowledge keeper bot that presents this information would present a base page with the video, the transcript, and some useful summaries.

People can start new sessions which change the knowledge the bot keeps and shares, plus it can be directed to pull in more information.

eg: go thru all your youbute videos and pull out every user story that we ever mentioned.
Now for each user story, try to run them using our sandbox environment.

Make a simple isolate that can run this package based on a url, so we can pull in the transcriptions easily.
