We could make it so that when it was considering a package to use, it should declares its pacakges first, and do some searches, then we will walk thru all these options simultaneously and pick some candidates for winning.

This forms part of a workflow where you pick your deps first, and then work towards that, so you can see where each line of development gets you.

At this stage, or after a few loops, we might identify a missing package that would be of great use.
