if we split the keys up, so that for a vm to run, it has to gather keys from different services, then to pop a vm by key theft, you need to break several independent services.

each service runs on the coco pool, with a different design.

cocos only run if all the services, or some quorum, grant keys.
means that these pools need to know what latest means, and only grant keys on latest being correct.
