I am always kind of maintaining my own knowledge base where I write down nuggets of knowledge that I want to use for later - this should be handled automatically.

these facts would have different levels of verification, some would be flagged as accepted by me, others refuted, or others that I am unsure about.

unsure means I would be interested to know more.
