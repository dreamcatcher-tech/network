If we can spec out a product that a lot of people want, then we should be able to escrow funds against those products.

Be like a more cooperative kickstarter.

You can enjoy revenue share without participation if we manage the rules right, so long as you also get a finished product.

There is no team specifically, just agreed bundles of tasks that need completion.

The goal is what matters.

Means that I can start to have the products I want, since waiting for them to appear seems to be taking too long.  We can also start to understand why some products are restricted, and include patent blocking paths.  Means we can find ways around the patents if we all own the company and built for our personal gains.
