simple version is just you have to talk to the agent directly for it to respond.
some agents need to be prompted so they know when they have something useful to say.

then agents can talk to each other behind the scenes, and decide what to do as a group.

then can have groups of adversaries, where I bring my agents, and you bring yours, and they talk amongst themselves, but never talk to your agents.
