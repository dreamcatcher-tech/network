start a session where you change the contents of a sysprompt.
tell HAL to start running it, which means you would start the agent up, and then join that session.
If you like it, tell HAL to push it up above, so it joins the catalogue.
Then, start a multisession agent and connect to the right path ?



Helps are a RAG to help a given bot have better context.

Should be able to show a fine tuned model in our system, or an agent run by a different mode, like Gemini.
