it is quite hard to work with frames using conventional tools, because the siolation makes it hard - no tool today makes isolation easy to deal with, but frames are critically dependent on isolation.

be cool if we could, even just using github, could cascade and update all the dependent frames and napps whenever anything upstream changed.

These watches could be with npm deps too.

Then we can get ghactions style runs going on our platform.

Then we can connect them up using prompts, where the prompts are auto tested to ensure the instructions are clear and the outputs are reliable.

so this would be an example of a text based crm where the tasks are not hard coded, but prompted, and then the prompts are baked to ensure they are clear and always have the same outcomes.  an overwatch keeps track to ensure nothing strange happened, which is already more reliable than what a traditional app would do.

without auto stuck gen the process is incredibly painful, which is probably why the process does not currently exist, as it is just pure loss.  So while we get close to auto stuck, things will be very painful indeed.
