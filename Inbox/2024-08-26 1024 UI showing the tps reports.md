If we get the switchboard up, and make it able to select the file runner, then we can target it at a single test that is being edited, run the tests, see the result.  Then edit the file.

So probably have a file editor view, then be able to test it, then push it to the parent.

threebox visibility choices need to be set - how can agents trigger the stateboard, and how can the human navigate around it.
Then when the human selects somehting, how can we add this in ?
