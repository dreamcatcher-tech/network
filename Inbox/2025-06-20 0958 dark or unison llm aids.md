Some of these languages can be remarkably simpler for llms to code and experiment with ?

as the llms reason thru things, they can provide training material ?

these languages supply good physics modules to get feedback on what the systme is.

we can build up a set of kb articles that guide the bot on choices. 

plus a good physics module lets it experiment whenever it wonders about something.

so having a physics module is key, and then storing the results.
