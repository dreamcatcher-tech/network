if you are accessing an anonymous sub, then if you are not authorized you cannot browse the root.

Need to be able to browse files, as well as branches, and commits.  But if it is a thread that you want to be active, then you need to browse it simply, somehow.

Like bare paths assume thread, otherwise it needs to be a file with share permissions.

apps are under some other subdomain, possibly their own one.

as soon as you log in, then you have more access controls.

Show a standard homechat when you join as a specific actor, offering you an anon thread to choose what to do next.

If the thread is redirected, then you need to have permission to read the link, then permission to read the link target too.
