for big tasks, it should try make little workers, and then test each worker before invoking in parallel.

it should keep running some checks on how long it thinks the tasks will take, to determine whther to do the parallel thing.  This can be happening in the background, so each of the agents is attempting a different type of solution, and they are sharing notes between them as they go.

a PM should be always estimating time till completion, calls till completion, and showing progress, plus token cost.
