All the little questions I ask could be filed away in the knowledge pool and be used as seeds for ideas.

Hopefully the AI can piece together some new ideas that the loose ideas and questions imply.

Also being able to find friends who are asking these similar questions, or seeing who is touching on these items, so I can find a live friend.  If we come close multiple times, the agents should introduce us.

Sharing the knowledge pool seems key - so not just one person, but every person, sharing these facts around.

A knowledge unit needs to have a format so it can be compatible with git and be referenced in multiple locations, with history, where the history is AI curated and entered.
