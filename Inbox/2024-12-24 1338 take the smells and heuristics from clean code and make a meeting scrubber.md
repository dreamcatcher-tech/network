Let it tag meeting interactions and flag individuals with unproductive traits, the impact, and also do some accounting to measure the scale of their impact.

**Existing Resources**  
There isn’t a widely referenced “Clean Code–style” canonical list for meeting communication errors. However, many communication guides and leadership handbooks cover recurring pitfalls. Below is a distilled, categorized list that parallels the style of “Clean Code” errors.

---

## 1. Redundant Rehashing

- **Description:** Repeating a point that’s already been made, or re-explaining something that was clear.
- **Consequence:** Wastes time, creates frustration, and diminishes speaker credibility.
- **Remedy:** Before speaking, confirm if the point is new or genuinely clarifying. If not, skip it.

## 2. Irrelevant History

- **Description:** Bringing up past issues or stories that don’t directly solve the current problem.
- **Consequence:** Derailed discussions, lingering grudges, confusion about meeting objectives.
- **Remedy:** If the historical context isn’t critical to the decision at hand, don’t mention it.

## 3. Overcomplicated Examples

- **Description:** Using lengthy or overly complex analogies when a simpler example would suffice.
- **Consequence:** Confuses the audience and sidetracks from the primary message.
- **Remedy:** Choose an example with the fewest moving parts needed to illustrate your point.

## 4. Scope Creep

- **Description:** Drifting into tangential topics or sub-discussions beyond the original purpose.
- **Consequence:** Meeting runs over time, main goals aren’t addressed, follow-ups become messy.
- **Remedy:** Use a “parking lot” for extra items, keep the conversation anchored to the agenda.

## 5. Unclear Agenda or Purpose

- **Description:** Diving into discussion without stating the objective or desired outcome.
- **Consequence:** Attendees lose track, decisions remain unmade, and confusion persists post-meeting.
- **Remedy:** Explicitly state meeting goals and confirm alignment before and during the meeting.

## 6. Neglecting Audience Context

- **Description:** Using jargon, inside jokes, or assumptions that confuse or alienate part of the audience.
- **Consequence:** Valuable input is lost when participants don’t fully grasp the discussion.
- **Remedy:** Tailor language to the group’s familiarity, clarify specialized terms or acronyms.

## 7. Rambling Monologues

- **Description:** Overly detailed or long-winded explanations that obscure the main point.
- **Consequence:** Attendees tune out, real collaboration stalls, meeting momentum is lost.
- **Remedy:** Lead with the conclusion or key idea, then provide only necessary details.

## 8. Monopolizing the Floor

- **Description:** Dominating the conversation without inviting others to speak or react.
- **Consequence:** Decreased group engagement, missed perspectives, lower morale.
- **Remedy:** Pause frequently for questions or handoffs, explicitly invite others to contribute.

## 9. Reactive or Emotional Outbursts

- **Description:** Responding harshly or defensively to criticism or new ideas, derailing logical discussion.
- **Consequence:** Creates tension, discourages honest feedback, and can stall consensus.
- **Remedy:** Stay neutral in tone, separate personal feelings from the issue, and propose next steps.

## 10. Undefined Action Items

- **Description:** Ending the meeting without assigning follow-up tasks or clarifying responsibilities.
- **Consequence:** Progress stalls, confusion about next steps, repeated discussions in future meetings.
- **Remedy:** Conclude every meeting by summarizing decisions and assigning owners with deadlines.

**Takeaways:**  
Like “Clean Code” principles, good meeting communication avoids redundancy, stays on topic, uses concise examples, and pushes clear outcomes. Minimizing these speaking errors streamlines discussions and respects everyone’s time.
