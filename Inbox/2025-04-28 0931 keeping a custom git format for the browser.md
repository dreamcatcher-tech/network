The server is supposed to do all the heavy lifting of git, and the browser is just a viewer.

So it makes sense to have a model that is tailored for the browser, and not require it to understand pure git, or features in git like pack and others.

Ideally once we get the stuckloop up, we can add these features in as modules over time.
