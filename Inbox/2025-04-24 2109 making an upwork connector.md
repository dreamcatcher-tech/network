As soon as we can push out some basic jobs that save time, then we can start to accelerate.

Then we can raise money based on the expected pricing of the tasks we have to complete to reach a certain milestone.

could maybe do jobs where a big job was published, and we break it down into smaller jobs and use upwork to manage it.
