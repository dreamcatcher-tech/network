eg: to make tests for a project, first list out what the names of the tests would be, in a tree.
Then provide a widget to remove, edit, or reorder these.

Once the widget is showing, human can quickly change the overall structure, without committing to the whole thing.

Same for docs, if we lay out a good structure, then the person can chat about the structure, and can manually alter it.

Then start generating subheadings.

Means can rearrange the whole doc, and then highlight areas that don't fit together semantically, so needs smoothing, but at least the users intend is more obvious.
