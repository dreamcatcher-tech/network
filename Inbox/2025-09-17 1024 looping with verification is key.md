if the ai cannot loop around, and if they lack stable reproduction / virtualization of side effects, then they won't be able to solve things.

eg: we get the best coding results if we have a `deno task ok` tool that can be used to verify everything works, as well as linters and other checkers in place.

one such tool could actually be another agent that gives style feedback, and won't pass things until the style is good enough.

trick with agentic seems to be when can we have enough stuff that we can point the tools in on themselves to accelerate development, and enhance reliability.
like when do we have enough utility to be useful to smax but also can start using them on themselves.

to work on enabling the self improvement too soon is to delay basic usage.
