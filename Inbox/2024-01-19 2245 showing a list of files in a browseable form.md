When the goal is to browse some records, we can render up the react component that is a big table of all the different things.

It can use the template to know what fields are available, and can start off with some sorting that seems appropriate, and the list of columns that are appropriate.  It can also scope the results down.

May show the progress of a loop in this way, where the status of the changes are reflected in the table.

If the user has indicated some preferences in the past, it will mention those with a link to the current preferences if the user wants to revise them.
