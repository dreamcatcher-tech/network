We are really trying to refine and boost intelligence.

The realtime intelligence is used to distill down a well formulated command to be entered into the request reply system.

Then this might use a higher intelligence to get some key information.

Then tools etc.

Then back to the user, then finally some interpretation by the voice api to give it back to the user in the mode that it was entered.
