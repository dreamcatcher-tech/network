If we made our own stock exchange, using our tooling to automate all the compliance burden, then we can acquire these companies and immediately list them on this stock exchange.  This gives us immediate fractional liquidity for these assets.  We can dissolve all the assets of the company into units that can be traded, so we can further make things liquid.

What we really need is a bank, or a banklike entity that can handle money, transact with the outside world, and provide infalible identity.
