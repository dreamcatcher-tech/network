we could use openrouter to maintain a fixed list of models.

then we make a mcapp that helps you choose the right model based on your needs.

so the chat mcapp would use this to present model choices ?

or, it would get passed a resource from this mcapp so it knows that it can call it correctly.

so the model selection is modularized out from the chatting.
