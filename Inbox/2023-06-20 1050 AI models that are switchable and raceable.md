If we can make AI services available as chains, then you can run arbitrary models in parallel and combine results.

Chains let you query mutliple different models and then summarize the results, or feed into other models.  Lets you have very complex flows.  Auditable in that they can be replayed.  Can be open so that the outputs can be parsed as training data.

Each time you run a model, it will be ethically paying out to everyone in the training set.

Model as a pool of hardware that is executing them, so you can run your queries against any model you like, or in fact several.  Works like an API, but you can easily run the model yourself, or shop around for price.  Spot like pricing that is based on people supplying their own hardware, or from using AWS spot instances to make up the hardware services.

Streaming output that is coming from multiple machines for repeatability.  Can choose to be cheap and run a single instance.  

Specify your pretrain data as chains.

Pay at good spot rates.  Supply your own hardware.  Run privately if you want, or make some tasks private and self hosted and others be using spot or dedicated hardware that you pay a premium for.

Higher uptimes of the service since blockchain distributed computing model.

We could run our own image generators using own own interfaces, and can handle our own charging of usage.  We can queue up some of the attribution that is due each time a payment is taken.  We can advertise we are working on AI attributions.

Tokenomics where a portion of all payments goes to cover paying for free usage, to encourage adoption and grow the network for all.
