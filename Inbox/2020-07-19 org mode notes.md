We want to be the application used for generating and commercializing open source software.  We do this by having an externalized graph database, where the usage of this database generates its own usage data.  By having micropayments allowing a replacement for ad based revenue with trivially small payments that add up to significant incentive to publish and maintain highly utilized open source packages.  We track contributions and attribute to them, pursuing fairness as the ruleset that bonds our collaborators together, with all other links being unconstrained.

We help you manage the sale within your org, pay commission, and pay the full stack based on our principles.  We are the place to come if you have a great idea, but don't know how to execute it end to end, or would like to amplify your reach.  

  

business model:

> private company that gets some funding together and offers shares, that will be repaid with an initial token issuance, which is a security

> When the token is deemed not a security, we will distribute the tokens to shareholders.  Along the way, the attibrution may be earned by those who hold shares at the time of conversion  
>   
> we do not want to have a traditional company structure, but rather aim to run our own company management systems as a test.  
>   
> generation of new apps and the fee paid to activate them is the revenue stream of the dreamcatcher.

money laundering via computational resources

> danger is a form of money laundering can take place if the price for compute resources is fair and predictable.  Someone can take bad money, purchase some servers somehow, then charge for their usage, earning clean money back.  This acts as an exchange for money and computation that can be used the same as any other value exchange.

cloud hosting model

> nobody can compete with people donating resources that are free to them as they are excess.  This will displace all cloud providers.  When the resource is free, the efficiency of the device does not matter, so even if we are 10x less efficient than a cloud host, we win.  However, we can be further efficient beyond cloud hosts, as we can be closer to people, and with higher bandwidth

the rules by which we split revenue are the rules that make a company.  To hit pure fairness means no need for company walls.  The walls are there within which to enforce the rules.  

  

make a fund that amplifies how we offer rewards. whatever funding we choose, it must support our allocation methods of fairness.

  

systems that gather and manage all the available info a person has, and then uses it for more than the initial purpose, to the benefit of the person.

> rather than gather just the minimum info, get it all

> open source systems that can be trusted look after the data securely

any machine that destroys data will reach an absurd clonclusion.

> stockmarket destroys ownership data, and disconnects shareholdings from company activity

when a series of locally optimized functions connect together to form a chain, errors compound

> eg: injustice in the supply chain - each point case looks reasonable, but added together the net result is absurd with unfair wealth distribution

> > or, each individual function has some unfair bias within, which compounds to be much worse

> note these compound errors never seem to result in some net benefit

find cos with users, then tokenize them

> existing whitepapers for companies make them more valuable

> extend with an ideas market, where fixed prices can be offered, but also where ambient attribution applies making the market fluid

Core companies must be defined by their protocols, not by their walls

> eg: hosting provider is not one specifically, but anyone can become a compatible hoster, and the whole group presents as one

> eg: software labour where the whole group is made of independent people, but presents as a single group

Object models of language could serve as babel to go between written languages

Ambient Attribution is greatest accelerant to rate of innovation, as value negotiations are removed from obstacles list

> ambient attribution allows orgs where not every piece has to be self sufficient, as overall value captured can be redistributed rapidly

users support something by paying for new features, then earn upside if they are useful

allow trusted execution of closed source code by block auditor programs to guaruntee formats

> like a block firewall, that checks for external comms, and internal state changes
