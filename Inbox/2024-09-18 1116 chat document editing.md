Have a sections component. That would Allow me to analyze the document. Update it to have a list of sections, that could be individually manipulated and managed by the AI. And the human could rearrange these sections or give them different weight. 

Talk about the these sections could then be expanded so that the overall document was considered modular rather than a single piece of text. In the background, an additional agent the considering the combination of them all and ensuring that they were modified or had joiner pieces inserted in case there was a lack of cohesion. At the same time, requirements and scores, then Specifications of the document are also being maintained as a separate file. So a document starts to look more like a folder rather than a single file.

**Atomic Ideas with Brief Expansions:**

1. **Implement a Sections Component**
    
    - Introduce a feature that divides the document into distinct sections, facilitating easier analysis and management.
2. **AI Management of Individual Sections**
    
    - Allow the AI to manipulate and manage each section independently, enabling targeted edits and enhancements.
3. **Human Rearrangement and Weight Assignment**
    
    - Enable users to rearrange sections and assign different weights or priorities to them, customizing the document's structure and emphasis.
4. **Modular Expansion of Sections**
    
    - Expand sections to treat the document as a modular entity rather than a single block of text, enhancing flexibility and scalability.
5. **Background Agent Ensuring Cohesion**
    
    - Utilize an additional agent that monitors the combination of all sections, inserting transitional pieces where necessary to maintain cohesion.
6. **Separate Maintenance of Requirements and Specifications**
    
    - Keep requirements, scores, and specifications in a separate file, improving organization and allowing for clear reference points.
7. **Document as a Folder Concept**
    
    - Shift the perception of a document from a single file to a folder containing multiple interconnected files and data elements.
8. Selection of sections and chat
	1. user can select several sections or subsections and can chat about them, asking for collapse, arrangementment, merge, something missing.
	2. 
In the background, agents are always looking at what is missing

**Additional Ideas:**

1. **Version Control for Sections**
    
    - Implement version control on individual sections to track changes over time and allow easy rollback to previous versions if needed.  May have each section as a file, then store the order as a separate file.
2. **Collaborative Editing Capabilities**
    
    - Enable multiple users to work on different sections simultaneously, enhancing collaboration and productivity.
3. **AI-Suggested Section Reordering**
    
    - Use AI to analyze the flow of the document and suggest optimal reordering of sections for better coherence and impact.
4. **Templates for Common Structures**
    
    - Provide templates for standard document structures, allowing users to start with a predefined layout that can be customized as needed.
5. **Tagging and Categorization of Sections**
    
    - Allow users to tag and categorize sections for easier navigation and retrieval, especially in larger documents.
6. **Integrated Feedback Mechanism**
    
    - Incorporate a system where AI provides feedback on each section's content, style, and relevance, helping users refine their writing.
7. **Export and Import Functionality**
    
    - Support exporting and importing sections or entire documents in various formats, facilitating sharing and integration with other tools.
8. **Visualization of Document Structure**
    
    - Offer visual tools to map out the document's structure, helping users see the relationships between sections and identify areas for improvement.
    - Visualization can be of character arc and reader interest graphs over string length, so can see where we might lose some readers.  Can apply this assessment tooling to childrens books after analyzing what makes a good book.
