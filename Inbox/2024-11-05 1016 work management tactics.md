If there is a document to be produced, it should always have a specified audience, and a purpose.
Then, to hurry things along, go find a person who represents that audience, and book a call with them, to present the material.  This sets a date and a test for which to get the things done, rather than no deadline set.

We should maintain a background list of tasks, and slowly work our way thru them.
One step at a time, and maintain the top level expected outputs.
Bots could watch to determine when they were done or not.
