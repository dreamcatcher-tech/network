Can double as a df utility.
Use to walk common usages and generate stats about how much space and time op took to do.

Crushed and diff sizes.

Graphical output with diffs highlighted.  Size annotated to the geometry.

Can be a general purpose schema to graphics utility.

Use this to show graphics of the block heirarchy, then show diffs as things move thru the system, so that we can get a good feel for how the system performs.

Make some kind of a rectangular positioning tool where the LLM can write little mappers that take a jsonschema and output a rectangular type of graph, so we can guide its construction using text, and then once it is positioned how we want it, it can present views of data that matches the schema.  If we show it some similar data, it should walk all past graphics that we made and generate something that is similar to what we want so we can start editing without delay.

Add some tools to let the user manipulate the shapes directly.

New way of programming where we say what we want, and then the machine loops until something sort of useful comes out.  If this flow is natural to the system, then the usage becomes the programming.

So programming used to be a separate endeavour to usage, but now they are the same.
