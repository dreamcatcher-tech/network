We can have provenance on code artifacts, and on git repos, but how can we have provenance on the executing environment ?

There needs to be some trusted provider that is disinterested.

Confidential computing means that you only need to trust the core piece.

If we could make the hosting publication step open and verified, that would give people assurance that what was running was indeed built from the git code supplied, provided you could trust the hoster.
