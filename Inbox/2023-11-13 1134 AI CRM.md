Handling the basic prompt.

"add a customer please"
Then we expect the LLM to query the

Make a function that is called whenever the llm doesn't know what to do.

Prompt the bot with the ability to use CD to go deeper into areas that it thinks sound like what it wants.



Kicking off the stucks loop for anything
Use embeddings to find a stuck description that sounds like what they want to do.
Turn the users request into a simple text description, and then use embeddings to find stucks.
If no stucks found, use this description as the means of creating a stuck.
The address space for stucks should be flat, but we might use summaries of stucks as a means of indexing to hone in on areas quicker, without needing to access everything.
Category tags can be used to help the LLM do categorization and get access to stucks that embeddings wouldn't give.
