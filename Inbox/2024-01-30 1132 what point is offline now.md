Could browse the raw files ?
Could write inputs that you want the AI to process when it comes online again.

So the pattern is to write to your git repo, make a commit, then push that up to the server ?
Or, push your input to the server, it makes the commit, and gives you the worktree result ?
If the server was responsible for execution, then the client can be responsible for submission and display.

Is the singing done browser side ?
