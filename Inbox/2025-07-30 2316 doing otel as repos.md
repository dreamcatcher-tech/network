if we sample each nodes perf and spans and store that in a repo, then we can do our own otel gathering, and can feed these back into the LLM to make tuning decision, and can crawl the repo looking for proof and tuning opportunities.

perf could be stored per repo, if the repo wanted to know about itself ?
or store alongside, private to the repo.
