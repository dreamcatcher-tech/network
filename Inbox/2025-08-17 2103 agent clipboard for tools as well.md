could we put an mcp server on the clipboard ?

could something live be put on the clipboard ?

this could act like a little notebook, where it can push things like tasks, and make little notes as it goes along.

It can have something like a workflow doc that it executes, or it can make a little note to carry on with something later.

Other agents can read this and build on it, and perhaps update it.

This makes the llms get served like us, where in the background, little agents keep improving what we did and polishing it eagerly.
