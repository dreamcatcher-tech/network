We should have to justify what tasks we're doing.
The chats we have should be scrutinized for being on track.

Some leeway must be given for the playful ness required to make discoveries.

pass in the goals, the tasks, and discussions, and ask what is the best thing to work on next ?

know the history of each persons completion, and what they're good at.
Have an internal model of how to structure a project, like peoples strengths and weaknesses.

If the ai is also doing a lot of the tasks, or can see what people are talking to it about, then it can determine or score what their strengths are.

Say why it made a choice, such as assigned or agreed skills, and then lets people debate about it, which it uses to update the precise internal model from all the fuzzy thinking.

What's the difference between managing humans and managing agents doing some work, where the agents are unreliable and long running ?
