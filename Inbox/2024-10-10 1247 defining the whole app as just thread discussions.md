Basically we should be able to fully spec behaviour in this fantasy chat mode, where you say what the system should have done when you did something.  This serves as the basis of a test.

Make a bot that is an expert at asking questions to clarify what the fantasy you want is, to clear up any ambiguity.

Then when we generate synthetic variations on what you said, you can go thru and select them.  This bot would try make a small number of wildly different suggestions first, as a ranging shot to get the user to show what they meant clearer.
