If we make a tool that we use ourselves that allows some willing accountants to provide their services in a way that grows the knowledge base and earns them a royalty, then we can offer this tool to others, and use it ourselves.

Being fully transparent means that we don't care if anyone sees our books info, and we still keep some info private.
