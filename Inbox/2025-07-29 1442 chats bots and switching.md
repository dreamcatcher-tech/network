an internal chat with a bot switches bot often.
a group chat, or a chat with an agent, doesn't switch often, but the agents could still switch in and out of the chat ?

we might not know how to do all the use cases with our current design (whatever that may be) but we do know that it is better than what we had, and we'll just have to rejig it when we get there.

So not much point spending hard slot doing big design up front.

as soon as we can get bots to help these kinds of design problems, we will go faster than doing it by hand.

put the new chat and browse chats button in the chat history viewer, so it will open up the stateboard with all your other chats.  Otherwise we need a dedicated chat bot.

we have these fundamental components, and ways of interacting with them:
1. chats
2. stateboard
3. bots

maybe group chats happen in the stateboard, and the chats are always internal ?  so you can talk directly, or you can use your agents to do things and say things to the chat ?

the chat is the human thread history.  it is driven by the human, and the system and bots are responding.
