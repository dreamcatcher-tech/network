If the step by step reasoning was done to explain why the given update regex was the minimum required, then we could be more compare regex expressions.
First tho, it should do reasoning as to which is the best section to do the update on.

Try the evals with different temperatures, or multiple temperatutes.

Theory is that mini using these multiple improvement cycles might give a better output than a single large model output ?

So some reasoning before choosing a path first, then further reasoning about other things.
Some place to list several versions of what could be asked for.

Even just listing the multiple versions of what a person could have said, then choosing the best one along with the reasoning why.
Does a fan out fan in type of intelligence.

The debug view helps the user understand what the model said.
