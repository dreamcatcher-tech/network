Use the timeline components to show rudimentary UI for steps that agents are taking, so you can see how their progress goes.

Might be able to use the agents sdk and integrate that inside a frame or something, so we can start integrating these complex tools inside a frame, where the frame can show the debug of the agent, allow some control and replay, but also, separately, show the outcome as an artifact frame.

can have multiple agents with steps showing in line, indicating progress.

simple timeline components, and possibly with forks showing corrections, or back tracks.
keep a side note going so it doesn't lose track of where it is.

but hopefully we can get all this managed by the dreamcatcher.
