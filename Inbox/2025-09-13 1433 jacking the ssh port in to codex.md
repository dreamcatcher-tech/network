if we start up a codex runner, and just tunnel all its commands in to a remote box, so it is operating on the bare metal server ?

remote in to the bare metal box, and run codex there directly, as an agent, with the external tool using mcp to talk to the remote thing like an agent.

the agent that gets deployed is super cautious and makes sure to always avoid cutting itself off, and may question the commands it receives.

so even after a completely compromised hypervisor install, the attestation of the coco should still be beyond reproach.
