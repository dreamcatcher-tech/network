We could ask for an agent to be working on the same set of files as us, but we could also ask them to make a whole new branch and then work there, and then we would review the PRs.
This is good for getting multiple approaches to be taken, and then looking at the PRs.

the agent represents the state container, which is mutating the came git commit.
we don't allow this to be done multiple concurrent ways in the agent, since that is supposed to be a separate agent.

Those threads of thought would surely never need to converse ?
