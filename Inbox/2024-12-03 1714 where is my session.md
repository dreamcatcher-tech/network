If I am in a browser, where is the ai session, if it is a decentralized system ?

It is on a hosting service that I trust, which might be decentralized among several hosting services that I trust.

Then the agents I interact with use the dreamcatcher protocol to interact with other nodes.

mcp doesn't cover the crypto signatures, or efficient data transfer, or payment.
nor can I simulate what the mcp server is doing ahead of time.
nor can the mcp server run ultra reliably.

But mcp makes a good mental model, that helps us an everyone else understand how ai systems connect to each other.

napp calls also extend out to generalized api calls.
napps can also directly wrap existing apis very thinly.
