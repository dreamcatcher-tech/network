Need to provide only the functions, and prove that the functions work using some example simple prompts.

Then take in feedback on how to make the descriptions of the functions improve, and ideally separate out these descriptions so they can be modified by AI ?


Lister of functions, so when this function gets called, it knows about isolates, and about api schemas.

Like linking the CRM but to system pieces.

These pieces should become the isolate API, and as a whole, provides a form of std library that helps can draw upon.

Just prove that we have a suite of AI callable tools that the AI can use under simple circumstances to do all the functions we want the running bots to do.  Then leave it up to Smax to do combinations of these functions to make the overall system.

? how does a user go about setting up a simulator to construct a CRM system ?

push, pull, promote of helps and HAL prompts.
Promote should take the helps but requires extra setting to promote the default help.

github syncing functions.

Later, have a trigger ability, so that when a help changes, the description of that help is updated too.
