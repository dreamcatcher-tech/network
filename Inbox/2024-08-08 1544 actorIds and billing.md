If all actions have the actorId attaached, then we can also relabel when an action is being done on behalf.

So Bob sends in an action to the CRM.  The crm is seen as the billing actor for everything it does as a consequence of Bobs action, but the translation is that ultimately Bob is billed for things, if that is what the agreement is.  Bob would have signed over some amount of credit that can be used by the CRM on his behalf.

Actors and the billable actor should be fundamental to the system.
