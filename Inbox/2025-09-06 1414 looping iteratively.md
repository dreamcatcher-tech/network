for bots to solve a long running task, they need to be able to exeucte the loop of dev test repeat.

so anything where they can fully observe the output is reuqired.

have levels, where if you think the fault is at the agent level, call on the agent container debugger, and then narrow it down to different experts.

tuis where the ai can see the results of the interface and can interact with it themselves, these seem very useful.
