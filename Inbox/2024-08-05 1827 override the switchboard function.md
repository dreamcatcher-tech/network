This can be a pain, so useful to be able to set our own switchboard config in the thread itself, which could just be a straight passthru, or a switchboard with limited options.

Backchat should be able to start a new thread with a different kind of a switchboard function.

The selection the switchboard can make can be restricted based on the purpose of the invocation.
It could be dynamically altered as well.

Agents might incorporate their own switchboard, so they present as one, but internally they are switching agents.
