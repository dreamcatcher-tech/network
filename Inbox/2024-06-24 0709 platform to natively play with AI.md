We should be the platform of choice to play with NL apps.

We should have a huge token rate flowing thru at any given time.
We should be where people store all their files and all their emails - all their private data - since it is theirs and they can monetize / value it.

We should be the the first to integrate a labour marketplace where you can get help with your idea, and provide equity split tools to reward competitors.

Should be able to pull up a list of all your bots that you are working on, in all their different forms.
Hit publish on any given one, and change the publication status.

Be able to fork anyone elses bots too.
