We should be able to parse these, write a response to the posting, and possibly generate some working code, using our infrastructure and framework, and then we just attach a license to the code that requires payment.

So identify problems that can be solved using our framework, and do this as a way of getting customers on our platform, since we integrated them on.  Our reputation should grow quite well, and then we also offer internal work advertising for follow up jobs.

So someone posts a job, we do it in an automated fashion, or take it 80% the way and then say we'll guarantee its delivery to 100% for $x, and then show them how to use our platform to keep working and further improve things.

So we get paid, we get new customers, and we get future work, plus we sell compute credits.

If we do this well enough, then people will see this as the way for them to win at upwork as well as their own clients.

So they will start being participants and collab for problems, also being salespeople.

Milestone is when two strangers collaborate to produce a client output on platform, where they have found it is cheaper for them to collab and share the output, than to compete directly for the whole prize.
