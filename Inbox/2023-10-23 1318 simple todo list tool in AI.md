Human can quickly blurt things out to their phone, using something like their watch to trigger the app to start listening.  It could physically be a pendant that connects to wifi when possible and has an app on the phone.

App asks clarifying questions but bundles them up to ask all at once.  When an answer to one of its unknowns pops up in a later blurt, it can intelligently interpret that.  Blurts can contain info on many different things.

Blurts can coordinate with multiple people, so if you're looking for something, the tools will coordinate to ask this information.  It will mask info between everyone too, so unless you share exactly what you're asking, there will be noise in there to mask your true requests.
