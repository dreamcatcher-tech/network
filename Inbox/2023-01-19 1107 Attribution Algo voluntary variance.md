In order to know what optimal is for hard things like what is the value of a project manager compared with a software developer, we need data.  Existing data is a starting point, but nothing more.  To achieve optimum we need to be able to vary what gets paid.  We should give the option to put your project up for experimentation, which makes it public, but also alters who gets paid what.  The amount of deviation is computed based on mean, and higher rewards are offered for higher experimentation.

Rewards are given to those who experimented for every time the algo runs, since their data contributed to discovering optimum.
