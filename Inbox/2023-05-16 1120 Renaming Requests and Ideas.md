Request becomes Problem.  This says nothing about what the solution is.
Idea becomes Spec (Specification of Solution)
Artefact becomes Solution 
App (Application of Solution) is a Solution packaged for consumption by a Buyer
Do-er becomes Solver

When we launch, buying accumulates, and waits for an oracle call to disperse the funds out.
The dispersed funds stay on the Dreamcatcher chain, and can be withdrawn to Ethereum by submitting the current attribution calculation.

Buying should be only for forward purchasing.  Buying of a finished and released app should be done thru some other channel, since there is no escrow needed.  DreamEther is about being an escrow agent - direct payments need not be on chain.

Buyers are like a funder for apps.  Funders participate in risk, Buyers do not.  Buyers are not compelled to pay anything at any time.  If an app is released and a Buyer simply changes their mind, they do not have to pay for the app.  They will not receive contributor tokens if they opt not to pay.  They are their own QA, in a sense.  They can remove their funds at any time.  Their only punishment is reputation loss, and contributor token loss.

Realization - name for what funding becomes once solved

Buying pays funders, whereas Funding only pays Solvers.  Forwards Buying pays only direct contributors, but retail buying pays everyone.  Forwards Buying should not do ambient attribution, since it is still in Venture mode, so is an encouragement for the direct participants only.

? should the tokens be opensea collections by packet, or by token type ?
