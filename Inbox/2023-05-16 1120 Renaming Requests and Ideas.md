Request becomes Problem.  This says nothing about what the solution is.
Idea becomes Spec (Specification of Solution)
Artefact becomes Solution 
App (Application of Solution) is a Solution packaged for consumption by a Buyer
Do-er becomes Solver

When we launch, buying accumulates, and waits for an oracle call to disperse the funds out.
The dispersed funds stay on the Dreamcatcher chain, and can be withdrawn to Ethereum by submitting the current attribution calculation.

Buying should be only for forward purchasing.  Buying of a finished and released app should be done thru some other channel, since there is no escrow needed.  DreamEther is about being an escrow agent - direct payments need not be on chain.

Buyers are like a funder for apps.  Funders participate in risk, Buyers do not.  Buyers are not compelled to pay anything at any time.  If an app is released and a Buyer simply changes their mind, they do not have to pay for the app.  They will not receive contributor tokens if they opt not to pay.  They are their own QA, in a sense.  They can remove their funds at any time.  Their only punishment is reputation loss, and contributor token loss.

Realization - name for what funding becomes once solved

Buying pays funders, whereas Funding only pays Solvers.  Forwards Buying pays only direct contributors, but retail buying pays everyone.  Forwards Buying should not do ambient attribution, since it is still in Venture mode, so is an encouragement for the direct participants only.

? should the tokens be opensea collections by packet, or by token type ?
Collection by type.  Looks cleaner in peoples wallets, different people will often tend to be into one type of token.  Split by collection, and then the packet name can be exactly the name of the Packet.  Image is overlaid based on collection, and based on packet type.

Buyers can have a crude attribution table where they provide a single value: the ratio between funders and solvers that they want.  We suggest a default which is set by us automatically, and is some formula based on total funding vs buy amount vs total buy amount ever.  Because if you are buying much more than the funding, then it says the solvers were brilliant, but otherwise it says the funders carried the innovation.

Could allow funders to also fund App packets.  Apps are a subclass of specs which are intended for end user consumption, the purchase of which will attribute back to 

Packeteer could be the packet itself, where each packeteer is given a weigtht.  They can perform splits or transfers as they wish.  Each account can only hold one.
