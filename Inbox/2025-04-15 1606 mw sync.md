we should probably just clobber the Names dir oid over into the main branch ?

In the main branch, whilst mw is operational, it is the canonical source.

So we would ban any changes occuring to the Names folder in moneyworks.

Whilst we could allow editing, it would ultimately get overwritten by moneyworks.

We could show the diffs between the main branch, and allow optional sync or not, depending on what we're doing ?

Might keep the top level dir object present in the browser and always patched ?
May use structural sharing to keep it light ?
