Also being able to run an erlang app across multiple containers.

Make the napp be long running, so a relatively heavy service can be orchestrated using artifact, and can coordinate with other running napps, or other services.

So ideally artifact should be able to orchestrate its own servers.

At some point this become essential, where it runs multiple systems in consensus, then they act in unison to make changes to any individual system.

So we could offer for an easy cheap way to deploy an elixir app with no loss of fidelity, and also plug its backend into other napps.  Comes with telemetry, and can give the app knowledge of its health, to present to clients.

Can easily have mango or other AI services available to the app.

Be global, instantly, zero cost when stopped.

Make it easy to develop these apps with an AI to help, and then get generative code out, that is instantly deployed.

Deploy all kinds of databases for people to use, and make them work as a hybrid, where you are in control of the containers, or fully managed services.  You own the containers, and we run and manage them, maintain the health of them.

So develop the code, use ai tools and a network of people to improve it and pay for it, then instantly deploy it globally.
