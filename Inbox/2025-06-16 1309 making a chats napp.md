this might be separate from the actual frame ?
or could publish the built files to jsr, and then load those files as the frame ?

this is the napp that would get called when we want to interact with chats.
this would be installed in the home repo, and could not be uninstalled.

the frame would render from the formats that the chats napp supplied.
they might be the exact same thing.
