Each user has an AI that makes recommendations to them, and can take actions on their behalf.

The bots must be independent of the exchange.  The exchange should be a DEX, and the bots use an API.

Lets you say what your strategies are, and let you play around until you get something you like back.

Give you any kind of report you want, and can crunch any of the data in the exchange that you want.  Queries are free if public, cost if private.

Lets you form trading groups that have bots in there to help you.  Proves the bots are private as you can supply your own api key.

These could be the same for stockmarkets, so we could upgrade / replace stocktwits.

Exchange could be for data access, too, such as trading your personal data, or large collections of data that you have, forming a collective agreement with a bunch of other people.
