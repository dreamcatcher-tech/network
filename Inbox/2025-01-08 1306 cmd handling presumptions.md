this mic recording thing is a great example - we both just presumed that if we had good quality audio, that the commander would be better, but turns out that wasn't the case, and we should have been called out on our assumptions early, and an experiment should have been demanded of us.

Every plan of action is based on some assumptions, and we should be explicit about those.

Particularly when it comes to the rules of AI and how to navigate a rapidly changing landscape.
