this would be a separate field, that would allow either static resources to be shared, with code that fulfills the request being just standard mcapp code references.

templates would be the same, as would be prompts and other resources.
they could be dynamic or static, where it could point to just some resources.

The mcapp can also point to static files using the git scope, or it can point to urls.

? how would we do dynamic links ? how would the napp gain access to the link ?
