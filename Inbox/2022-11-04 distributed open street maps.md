If the map data is broken down into chains, then we can allow a fully offline and distributed version of streetmaps to be available to anyone running the protocol.

Can do routing by providing the computing resource to run it, rather than a complicated setup, or relying on someone elses compute resources.  Can pay for speedy resources in the same way as you pay for any resources.  Programming model may allow parallel executions to make things faster.

Geocoding can include updated responses, and more precise information, like where a driveway is, access to rubbish bin, etc.  Can include history of access with differential privacy, or direct sharing between companies who pay for the ability to access each others data.

Makes it easy to do completely offline mapping, with offline editing and redistribution to peers.
