In the branchfs, we need to copy back all the objects in the git dir over to the parent git dir.

If we used a layerfs, then only the contents of the layer need to be copied.

Often these other branches are never fetched again

so we could do a pack on it once the merges are accepted, which gets rid of the layer and does a compaction ?

Ideally each branch is its own layer ?

Pack removes the need for the small objects from the branch

So we would walk the layerfs, get all the oids that are unique to this branch, then we would set it up as a layer, and write a packfile representing the branch.

The fetching of each layer in the fs should be progressive as well, so we only get when something requests it.
