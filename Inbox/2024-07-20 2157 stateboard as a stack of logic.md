If it is a list of components to render, and then the layout is handled by html layout logic, the display can be very dynamic.
The display could write down how it is rendering, or send in a screenshot of itself.

Make a pdf viewer, so that we can be rendering print quality pdfs live, based on generative ai output.

Frames in the book can be separate markdown files that are rendered as pdf to show the user, or can be markdown, then toggle.
Do a single page at a time, or do the whole pdf.
