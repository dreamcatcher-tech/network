IF we make the algo run using AI, then we can build modules that implement the functions quickly and repeatably in code.  If we want to make patches, we first patch the AI NL code, then implement in traditional code.

Ideally we would write code with no deps, and we would get the AI to verify the code.

The AI should still sit above the running algo, as it would be the last veto check.  It could only say no to it, so it can't reverse any code decisions in the negative.
