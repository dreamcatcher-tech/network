If you're in a chat, then you should be able to select files and haul that context in with you.

So you go into files, select you things, and then either:
1. show the transclude device and so you know its coming
2. or know that when you switch to somewhere next, you're bringing that context with you

Repo button could just show a whole frame, which represents all your repos ?
