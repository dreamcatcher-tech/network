if messages could be a scope and a read or an open, and open can include a widget to show.

the default display is just the file browser

command could be navigate to, which can ask for a particular widget.

loading nested widgets is just reading data, and then relaying what the nested widgets are doing.

needed when the ui gets large, so we can work on bits in isolation.

might need some extra widget api, like allowing it to navigate to a new widget.  All else remains the same artifact api.

a serviceworker could be set up to handle all requests centrally, so no dedupe and always off main thread.
