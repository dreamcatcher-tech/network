>[!question] Targets: 

>[!danger] Depends: 

Does not mention ambient attribution
No advertising of problems and assisted matching of solutions
Does not mention the problems that occur during these ventures - technical problem
Deduplication of effort between entities solving the same problem
Not mentioning the tracking of all activity - ambient activity tracking
No portability of software mentioned
Need to solve the equity problem when partnering and working together
Also we do not want to engage in these undertakings without our tooling in place, else we will drown in the admin, but we really want to leverage this new ability to process all comms.

It is as tho what we want is layered, and we can't get our top goals without doing the minimum in the other layers, like having a working platform.

We could measure each proposed business idea with the scores it gives in our assessment tool.
Make a little bot that demonstrates the scores, and then lets you compare with other opportunities.
