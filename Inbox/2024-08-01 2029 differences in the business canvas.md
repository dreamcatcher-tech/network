>[!question] Targets: 

>[!danger] Depends: 

Does not mention ambient attribution
No advertising of problems and assisted matching of solutions
Does not mention the problems that occur during these ventures - technical problem
Deduplication of effort between entities solving the same problem
Not mentioning the tracking of all activity - ambient activity tracking
No portability of software mentioned
Need to solve the equity problem when partnering and working together
Also we do not want to engage in these undertakings without our tooling in place, else we will drown in the admin, but we really want to leverage this new ability to process all comms.

It is as tho what we want is layered, and we can't get our top goals without doing the minimum in the other layers, like having a working platform.

We could measure each proposed business idea with the scores it gives in our assessment tool.
Make a little bot that demonstrates the scores, and then lets you compare with other opportunities.

The basic premise is that we can generate apps incredibly fast, and continually adapt them rapidly, for very low cost.  We need to prove this working, but it is looking very likely we can do this.  However the

The types of network services we provide to any given venture are:
- external problem solving
	- blockchain matters here, so small contributors can be assured of ongoing royalty payments in the future, and trust the modifications that occur, by being able to see how it works
- deduplication of problem solving
- shared cost of problem solving
- shared access to customers
- ambient attribution - solving the problem of how to cut up the pie in a project or venture - this is where we want to make the majority of our money

The effects we want to induce are
- merging of business functions between businesses
- faster collaboration between people
- data generation to learn and train from, as to how people interact and what is valuable behaviour

Make a revenue projection diagram in mermaid over time showing our sources of revenue and how we want them to change.
- ambient attribution
- 
Show where we plan to spend our money over time too - platform features, acquisition so we can demonstrate and test, plus get a revenue base.
- platform reliability, security
- integrations - with blockchains, email, chat apps, common cloud apps
- acquisitions of small businesses to measure the improvements and learn from

User acquisitions reasons over time
- features
- money now
- royalties
- ethics

User retention reasons over time
- the features
- the people
- the attribution
- the private data trust

Things we think are coming
- ethics in business
- increasing compliance regulation
- private data protections
- Self sovereign data
- permissionless reuse of IP with automated royalty payments

shared problem sponsoring
shared problem solving - incentivize competiting against time, cost, and losses, not against each other

Acquisitions are a way to pump funded problems into the network.

We need micropayments - the same quality guarantees as receiving a bank payment, but for huge numbers of very small amounts.
Reliability of operation, capable of netsplit due to political reasons.
