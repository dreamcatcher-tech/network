If a database was made in pseudo-schema, and parsed by AI, then creating new complex systems becomes more accessible to people since structure is really only required for machines to parse the information.  But if the machine can parse natural language, then why bother with the painful precision of the schema ?

Storing text is the most compact form, as structure costs storage.
Freeform means that the schema can be updated on the fly at any point with no release cycles required.
New data can be ingested without any formatting or translation required.

Objects can be assembled based on some basic structures.  Collections and records, where they can be linked and nested.
Updates are trivial, even in bulk.
Indexes can be built where queries are run using AI like a lens.
Template.
Rules that apply down the tree.
Filesystem relationships in a DAG.
# Example

In the CRM, we have a minimum information requirement. We can set some rules at the top of the system that say what the minimum is required, then we can walk the collection and check each one.
