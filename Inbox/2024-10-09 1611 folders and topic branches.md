If we have a main branch, which is the knowledge base, then we have branches that are processing branches, then we have topic branches that come off main that are worked on by the process branches, then, we should have folders that mimick these topic branches.

So the anchor of several topic branches is the folder on main, as this is the canonical tip of the topic.  Topic branches seek to move forwards knowledge about that branch ?

Or, the topic branches move the knowledge base as a whole forwards.
