Write a pomodoro napp tracker that aligns with stucks.

Could give it a nice android app interface to run on.

Ideally we would have an android app wrapper so that any napp can trivially be made a native android app.

Then the stuck you work on is what you would select to pomo against, and so all you actions on the platform can be categorized as being that thing too.
