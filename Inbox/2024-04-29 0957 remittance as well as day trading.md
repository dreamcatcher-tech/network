The logic for connecting to crypto or fx or stock exchanges and make trades as a way of moving money arround for cheap and fast remittance seems the same logic.

If we build these components, then license them as ambient attribution, then we can have additional revenue streams.

Ideally we would help individual locals be registered as money transmitters so they can engage with local clients directly.  Avoids central processing and pushes out to the edge.

Participants have to pass kyc with one of our service providers first.  An insurance service takes a cut to guarantee smooth fast operations.  Insurance is a great business, like crowdsourcing the teaching of something to provide back something that no individual alone could afford to do.

Help people provide the bankrolling to local dealers in exchange for a larger cut.  So we as the central issuers take no risk, but provide mechnisms that others can take risk with programmatic guarantees.
