then we could do just pure proxy protocol, and pass raw bytes around, meaning no more proxy issues.

each app that starts should have a process manager view show for it, that might be a webpage or a tui, like the pm2 tui, and then each face is up to the face implementation.

we need tcp because we need comms between agents.

if face access was handled before the container even gets involved, then the proxy becomes dumb, in that it just passes data around.
