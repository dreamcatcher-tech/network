agents should be aware of other running tasks, and they should be able to queue up behind other things, so they basically pass the baton around between them to avoid collisions.

there should be a queue manager that looks at the jobs, and reorders them, or runs them in isolation so they are guaranteed not to collide, or compacts them into one job.

It might also break them up into multiple jobs in this queue, so we would see several commits to get a given job done.
