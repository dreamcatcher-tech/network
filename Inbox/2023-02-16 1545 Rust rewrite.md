If the engine was rewritten in Rust, then we could provide a wasm interface in the browser, and presumably it would run faster there too.

If libp2p worked in Rust, then we could use this on the server.
Or, deno with wasm on the server, to get the same amount of speed roughly, but still being able to use libp2p for networking.

BUT only js has isolation, and only deno has isolation server side, so the engine will always need to execute js to take advantage of this lightweight isolation, or use containers, which are much heavier
