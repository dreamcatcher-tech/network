Would be faster using pijul with some modifications to tendermint to allow more rapid consensus, but can make a git version first.

Set up a workflow or state machine, and then have it execute by bots doing the steps to each state, and then have messages coming in from peers.

This should be able to use our regular workflow tools to run tendermint, and then prove it works reliably, but has very little code requirements.
