Hook the repos so that we periodically push to github when changes occurred so that you always have the latest version.

Let you push and pull to other repos you own.  Control github and do things like create a repo and then push to it, create pull requests, pull in other repos that aren't artifact and just work on them in our tool.

We should be able to upgrade the db formats and not dunk everyones setup.

This is show in the UI as the backup symbol.

Then we can also rerun the logic in an isolated running, which will badge as being checked by your trusted computer.

Finally we can peg to a higher chain which indicates consensus, and can show that it has been pegged to eth or something similar.
