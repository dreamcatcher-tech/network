Once we can generate a huge number of interactions with the chain, we can train the model to know about core components like pulse format, covenants, pathing, collections, datums, and other items.

This could save a lot tokens to get good performance, and save time as responses would be more instantaneous.

This fine tuned model could be something we sell as we can command access to it.
