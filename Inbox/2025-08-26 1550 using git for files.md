right now, the speed need for files is low, so we can pull in from github, and rally round those repos for making changes and doing commits.

this mechanics should be identical to what artifact would provide, just faster and lighter on resources in artifact.

so we provide the git repo and commit by way of a github url, rather than an artifact address ?
