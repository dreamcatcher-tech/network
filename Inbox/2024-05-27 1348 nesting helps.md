If a help engages another help BUT PASSES THE PROMPT ALONG WITH IT then when the user interacts, then will be engaging with this other help.

They can jump out by clicking the breadcrumbs up to the higher helps, or using NL ?

Drill back down by clicking on the jump off point.
If you start typing in the higher thread, you can't rejoin the jump off point without losing your changes.

Snip git history off by requiring all interactions to be sequential, so you can't go back and branch and then rejoin the main line - if you go back, all threads go back too, which greatly reduces tangles.
