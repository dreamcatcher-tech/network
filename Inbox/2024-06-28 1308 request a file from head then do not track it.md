This is a way to request a file using the http GET and then track when there are changes to it ?

This would be a viewer that started up a little page with a tool that used the websocket to track and then redrew the file when new things showed up.  Like a special kind of viewer.

Would be the same as what gets shown in the stateboard, but this can be opened up into its own window.
