If we made instead an api service that did whole operations for us, that might be a better thing to host on deno ?

They might not like the direct passthru part of github.com.

So instead of proxy, it does our api and sends the results back down.

For repos this might be troublesome, but for operations like forking, this should be simple.

We definitely need openai api management to be in deno.
