if we present an mcp server that has a standard form of trade recon, then we can connect to it from anywhere.

so each clients system, whatever it is, presents itself as an mcp server ?
either:
1. the existing systems present themselves as mcp servers and are interrogated
2. the existing systems push into the central mcp and then recon is performed there.

then the blockchain mcp can be interrogated by each party so they know where they need to reach recon.
there is no central party but the auditable shared state is available to all parties without a central party.  Makes it super compatible, since for them to use this data, the format is just mcp.

mcp consensus.

two way mcp servers ? where one can query into the other ?
