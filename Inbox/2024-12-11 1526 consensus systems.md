Proof of stake that doesn't require an intrinsic asset tho.

Proof of value, where somethint important like publishing a popular npm package can be used to leverage extra verification of the chain state.

If people sign for a package release at the same time as signing the tip of the chain, or better yet committing to the chain, then this is a kind of staking that is powerful, as it leverages all the dependence all their followers have on them being correct and uses that to cosign the tip of the chain.

It could be for something simple and low compute, like checking a range of money transactions and verifying they were done correctly, rather than checking the work itself.

Separating the asset transfer from the work transfer, so that if the work is faulty, that is a different independent process to the asset register.
