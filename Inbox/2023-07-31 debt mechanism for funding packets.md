If an entity issues its own tokens, then they can be used to fund packets. The funds may be subject to clearance, similar to how credit card processing works.  This can be independent of any particular contract, and can just be lien enabled NFT tokens, which have some stable coin value but are subject to being yanked if the payment fails.  The proof of the fail would be uploaded to chain, and some possible dispute process would take plae.

Each time a customer makes an agreement to pay, the proof of this is pushed into an erc1155 issuance, and then the funds are sent to the client to do with as they please.

So they can fund packets, and it can be seen that they have promised to pay upon completion.  The entity that issued the tokens can include a percentage fee which covers legal costs of recovery, so the recipient can be sure they will receive their funds.

The issuer contract can be restricted to only allow tokens to be held by the dreamether contract.

May allow only those that hold an approved soulbound token to be able to transact in these tokens.
