Any any way to test our systems and prompts on lower powered machines such Cheers. Hey. Graphics card powered accelerator. So that we can know that our prompts operate in low power mode or high powered mode. We should be able to turn off parts of the system when we're in low powered mode. This means that we can run AI on the edge and still be confident in the quality of the output.
