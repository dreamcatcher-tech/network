If we make a blockchain that can tap the fly.io infrastructure directly, then we can dial up the machines, and spec the resources available to each one.

This means that we can have an image on hand in a location ready to go, but can quite quickly online some bigger machines when we get a spike.

Online a bigger machine first, since we don't know how long the load is going to climb for.
