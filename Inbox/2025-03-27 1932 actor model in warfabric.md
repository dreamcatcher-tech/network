So at all times we always store all the data we have available in the actors repo, that they can download any time they like.  We can block the private data branch unless you want to delete your account, since once that data is gone, we cannot guarantee the integrity of the system.

We can map out secrets to hashes, where the value is inserted only during outbound calls.
The secrets map is stored in the actor store, but it is not extractable.
