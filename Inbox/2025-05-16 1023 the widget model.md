>[!question] Targets: 

>[!danger] Depends: 

1. the artifact interface for accessing the artifact computer
2. updating the ui state manager interface, which is not a blockchain but could be
3. receiving driving instructions from the ui state manager interface

the context navigator lets the widget update the manager with the contect that has been selected by the widget, within the permitted widget scope.

? multi scoped widgets ?
scopes should just be an array, and the widget should be made aware of its scope, altho it could be limited / restricted, in that it might just think its in any old folder.  we can supply special values for repos and commits to mask this info from the widget.

the widget store, where many widgets display what they can do, that is browseable by an ai agent, so the agent can try them out.

this is the foundation of jitters, where apps are rapidly composed on the fly, and with a little longer, a custom app that suits your needs well is developed entirely by the ai since the lego connectors were easy.
