Want to provide an easy onramp for coordination with limited liability protections that doesn't use shares to measure ownership or contribution.

If no need for shareholdings, then the incorporation can be very light.

If taking on liabilities, then we can offer a shared system, but best if you purchase your own.

We would file articles of incorporation that had 1,000 share classes, and then we just map them to the trading as thing.
