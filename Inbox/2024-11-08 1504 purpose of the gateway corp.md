Want to provide an easy onramp for coordination with limited liability protections that doesn't use shares to measure ownership or contribution.

Want to get away from implicit companies and into declarative companies.  Declarative means they declare their goals, and the management towards that is external and AI managed.

Rules of the company being standardized to things like all contribution must be recorded.

The control of what the company is becomes based on external forces.  If you want to change, you would abandon it and start again.

If no need for shareholdings, then the incorporation can be very light.

If taking on liabilities, then we can offer a shared system, but best if you purchase your own.

We would file articles of incorporation that had 1,000 share classes, and then we just map them to the trading as thing.

Basically we use the models of shared hosting services to handle impact and reliability.  We also ensure that no assets are held, so teardown is easy - you just have to update your ip address so to speak, but if you're using our software, we update all that transparently for you.
