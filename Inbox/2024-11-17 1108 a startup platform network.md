Be able to go from idea to launched multinational corp in minutes.

We should use AI + humans to do all the admin tasks related to starting a company of any scale.

Humans having control is where much fault lies, since there are components that are required for any given company, such as taxation, regulation.

Introduce new ideas across the platform and have every company upgrade immediately.

Some of the human admin, like call centres or other things are done using human pools.  Some groundwork is done using human pools, where people can be audited for compliance, also their actions are recorded so you can measure their performance, much like uber.

There should be no advantage to doing all this yourself, as we would be cheaper, instant, larger.  Then this system would never be displaced since it is the best possible ideal place to launch from and all launches on this system would outpace and save cash faster than any other way, meaning they get cash posistive quicker which means less raises, less death, more reliable, then perpetuate the cycle since they can now invest and start other things.
