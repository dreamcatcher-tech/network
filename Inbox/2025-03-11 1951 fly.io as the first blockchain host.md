It seems like the best place to get our model correct, check our incentive measures and experiment with the demands of the market before we commit to the rather laborious task of building it as a truly decentralized bring your own hardware type of system. As well, we may require some extra hardware like enclaves or secure computing or something 

The Fly API is very elegant and simple, making it small enough that we can understand it thoroughly. They've abstracted computing very well, which leads to the ability for us to make a blockchain-based controller of the Fly.io infrastructure, giving us genuine hyperconvergence. 

We could maybe one day orchestrate the hardware raw directly, but for now, orchestrating the Fly API is sufficient and demonstrates what we're heading for. 

It's much simpler than the AWS SDK because the ability to make a machine that starts very rapidly like a Lambda function allows them to collapse multiple service offerings from AWS into a single, simplified API.  effectively they reduce the number of components required to offer an AWS-like service. 

Even the queue processing of Shockwave could be sold as an independent service of a managed guaranteed properties queue with very high compute attached to it.
