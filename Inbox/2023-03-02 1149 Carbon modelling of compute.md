How much does a server / application deployment cost in terms of carbon ?
The systems used to run particular apps can be tallied up and measured.
The load on the systems can be used to map variable carbon output.

Our apps, based on the standard joule, can automatically compute their CO2 consumption.

For existing systems, we can allow a simple model to be made that assesses the usage of these apps.

If you do not count your mobile phone, then we are essentially running for free.
