How much does a server / application deployment cost in terms of carbon ?
The systems used to run particular apps can be tallied up and measured.
The load on the systems can be used to map variable carbon output.

Our apps, based on the standard joule, can automatically compute their CO2 consumption.

For existing systems, we can allow a simple model to be made that assesses the usage of these apps.

If you do not count your mobile phone, then we are essentially running for free.

Model monitors in terms of usage over time, plus difficulty of manufacture.
May show that eink monitors are significantly better for the environment.
Espeically if apps were designed to work with the poor refresh performance, then
Browser app can work in this way with an overlay on top of a normal react app.
Scrolling is done by fading the portal and scrolling a blob to give feedback, then redrawing the portal once finished - basically techniques at the UI level.
