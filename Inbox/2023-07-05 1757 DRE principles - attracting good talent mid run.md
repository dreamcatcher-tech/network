Often good talent starts a project, then it goes thru a doldrums, then money starts to roll in and it can afford to improve, then it really takes off.

Based on early incentives being the same as all other stages, we should attract good investment minded talent early.  The equity rewards get less and less the older a project gets, but for us it is  continuous and invigorating.
