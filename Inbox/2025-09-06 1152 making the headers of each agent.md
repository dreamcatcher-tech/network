make a web server then attach different features at different routes.

attach the view proxy, where it proxies thru to another agent, but also where it proxies thru to a view.

General proxy ability seems the goal ? if it was just a complete proxy passthru service that is the header ?

running as a root agent seems different, as this *could* use actual proxying, but fly replay seems best there since no load, and make the redirect permanent.
