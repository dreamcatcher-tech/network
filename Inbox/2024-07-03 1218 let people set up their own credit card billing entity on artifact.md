Would be best if we handled the billing, but we might lose our relationship with Stripe if we are paying out to other service providers.

However if we were the ultimate service provider, and people just effectively worked for us, then we hold the money ?

Ideally people should be able to start selling goods and services on our platform, and we do the billing on their behalf.  Or, other payment providers can do that billing.

Probably can have a standard format for payments, using ledger plain text or similar.
