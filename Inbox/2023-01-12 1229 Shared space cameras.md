Cameras that push their output to chain based verification services, which can have access to the feed opened up in a differential privacy way.  Good for shared spaces, or multitenant offices.

Offices with open plan can give access to part of the feed to the people who the camera is watching.  So nobody can see everybody, but they can all see and share themselves.

Can share a blurred view if presence info is good to share.
