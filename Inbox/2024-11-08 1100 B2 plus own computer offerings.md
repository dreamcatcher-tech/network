Be able to hook up your own server to hold the binary data that belongs to your repos.

Then rent this space out to your friends, with some limits managed.

Set complex rules in english for how to manage the space.

Then be able to rent out to the public as well, being a competitor to filecoin.

This would be done using stripe processing for credit cards, so people pay our company to store the data and manage the money flows all round the place.

Also manage compute and GPU rentals.

Start the GPU market by just renting out AWS spot instances.  Our programming model means they can be torn down easily, making it ideal for harnessing spot.

Then as people online cheaper or green gpus, the market starts to grow more, and we receive a cut for helping coordinate.  mining pressure keeps prices good and also pays attribution.

spot is about 1/3 to 1/4 the price.
So we could run a spot monitor on artifact, and then fire up spot instances based on load.
If jobs were specified using napps, then we could also offer aws running systems, so the napps get run at good times.

Basically we need a way to trade compute resources, and storage.
