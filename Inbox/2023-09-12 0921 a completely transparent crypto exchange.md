So fraud is a huge problem for crypto exchanges.  Fraud hurts regular users.  So if we ran a completely transparent exchange, where the fraud prevention was everyones responsibility, and we required everyone to share some data, like what they were doing, and where the funds came from, then reward people to detect fraud on the platform successfully, legit users would come use us and banks would be more tolerant of our fiat activity.

Ran like a coop, where the banking licenses are the property of the DAO.
