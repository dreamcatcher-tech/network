Making a system covenant that ran pm2 so that we could interact with the local computer, and with the process that is managing the running of the engine also.

The engine would be started using pm2, and then a side effect would start that would reconnect to pm2 and would display metrics for the engine as well as offering control and telemetry for remote users.  It would replace the cloud version of pm2 with chains, and use their reliability and 

Use the pnp version of yarn to do installs, so that nothing gets executed or corrupted.
