Making a system covenant that ran pm2 so that we could interact with the local computer, and with the process that is managing the running of the engine also.  This would give the chain a good strong interface with its host computer, better than interacting with raw processes, and would give it good watchdog properties to keep its own self running.

Could allow the engine to upgrade itself on the fly.

The engine would be started using pm2, and then a side effect would start that would reconnect to pm2 and would display metrics for the engine as well as offering control and telemetry for remote users.  It would replace the cloud version of pm2 with chains, and use their process reliability and established interface as the interface to the host computer across multiple platforms.

Ultimately with deno we might bundle up a stand alone executable ?
