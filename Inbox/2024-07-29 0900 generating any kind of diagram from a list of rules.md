Perhaps all diagrams can be used to express any set of rules.
It is an inappropriate diagram if adding an important rule causes no change in the diagram.

Questionss houdl be keyed towards the type of diagram we are trying to make.  We should know about examples of prior diagrams and rules we were missing.

Make multistep examples where we walk thru a large number of example diagrams and compare what we have.

A sequence diagram cold be expressed as rules.

Bots should be made to turn observations into rules - humans can describe a scene in natural language, and then we can get the rules out of that.

When exercising something, we should reference the rules we used, ranked by priority.
