if the face is now the agent, then we would want the default view to be the ttyd view ?

the web server would still look for mcp incoming on the default path, but then it would proxy thru to the default view ?

or rather, the mcp should be at a fixed port, as a second service, and the default pretty port for the humans is done using the default view ?

so the face views needs to 

so you would be starting a new view or set of views into the agent.
then you interact with the views.
