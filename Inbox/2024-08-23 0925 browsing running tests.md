If the branch shows it as running, then we should be able to click on the tool in the thread, and have the stateboard show a viewer of that thread, so we can dig in to it ?

The user would be actively switching the stateboard at that point, and they could drill into threads even more inside the stateboard.

OR we could unfold the thread in place, with an option to display the same widget in the stateboard.

Just provide some way that we can view the execution.

Then also allow to view the files, so we can read in the json file.

Then, ask questions about the json file so the bot can do some analysis.
Possibly define the rules of the json object, and provide a class file and test file that implements those rules, so we can rapidly make a very safe piece of code to manage a data structure.
