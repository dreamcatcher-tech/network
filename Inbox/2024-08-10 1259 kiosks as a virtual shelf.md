Ideally want that to be a platform, where bots, and specialized bots can be chosen.

Merchandizers pay for shelf space and position, like if they got recommended, or what best represents.

Stores can tweak the sales dials too.

Core bots as services can be chosen by the store beyond the base one.

Can exist on the website too, so anyone can keep up a conversation.

Ideally the convo would pass beyond the store and be the persons broader assistant, or their assistant could talk to the store assistant.
