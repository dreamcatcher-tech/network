first we deploy our app, the seed app.

then, conditionally, because we are seed, it boots the default agent, with 2 machines for resilience, and some custom config.
the custom config tells the app what to write in workspace.toml.
this app contains a base agent that is prompted to encourage sign in.
When they do signin, 


we would make an infrastructure app that controls the provisioning of new apps and hardware.  This is accessible only via flycast.



simplifications:
1. no multifaced agents - one agent one face
