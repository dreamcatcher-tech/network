Perhaps we can make an automatically active listening meeting environment because as each person speaks, the bot tries to craft a statement that represents a summarized version of what they said. Other participants can make comments that can refine it, and so it seems to naturally steer the conversation towards refining this little statement from the point of view of all the participants. Once you've got it refined, you can get points or points for helping do a refinement versus just carrying on trying to make your point. And then at the end, I guess, people who weren't listening would not have contributed to the clarity of anyone else's points. So you'd get some kind of measurement for things you introduced, also a measurement for refining, where scoring high for refinement indicates an active listening score. So you can actually be told by the stats that you didn't listen.
