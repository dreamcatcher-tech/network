We should be able to return when the action has been received by the branch, and then trust that the execution will continue as planned.

This decreases the number of commits required, since a single commit receives the action, then (after we allow pooling and execution to be the same action) transmits the transmissions to other branches, as well as replies with the pierce response.

Otherwise the number of commits goes up quite a bit since all the actions need to ripple back.
