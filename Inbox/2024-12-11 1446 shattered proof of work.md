Use this as a guide to why proof of real work is more scalable, since the work can be verified before being merged in to some higher chain.  It can also be spot checked, and the workers can stake anything at all of acceptable value to be accepted.  It should not matter that the stake was native currency, it should just be enough to build a trust score out of.

We should be able to allow any consensus mechanism at all, and it is simply up to the merger to accept the PR or not, based on its awareness and acceptance of the consensus mechanism.

it would appear that the token massively distorts the chains behaviour and its community.

Think of it as applying a Bitcoin-like proof-of-work model, but at the level of discrete, independently maintained segments of the ledger, rather than a single continuous chain. Each segment—perhaps a repository branch or a standalone ledger instance—runs its own PoW to authenticate and order its transactions or commits. The key difference is that each segment’s work is locally verifiable and self-contained, without needing centralized coordination or a single global state.

When these isolated chains need to merge, they can rely on the completed proof-of-work to establish trust. Since PoW outputs are universally verifiable hashes, the merging node can quickly check the validity of another chain’s work without relying on a token-based incentive system. Consensus emerges from the objective difficulty of producing these proofs rather than from economic stake.

This decentralized, “shattered” PoW approach would allow:

1. **Isolated Operation**: Different teams, regions, or devices can run their own private chain segments, performing PoW to secure their local state.
2. **Later Merging**: When these segments need to combine into a single coherent chain, their relative trustworthiness is gauged by the cumulative work demonstrated. The chain with more total work can be considered authoritative in any conflicts, similar to how Bitcoin’s longest chain rule works, but now it’s applied across multiple disjoint sets of commits.
3. **Token-Agnostic Security**: Unlike PoS or token-based models, this system doesn’t rely on internal currency for security. It uses the cost of computation and electricity as the barrier to rewriting history, thereby removing the unfairness or distortions introduced by a chain’s native token.
4. **Git Integration**: If your chain state is represented via Git commits, you could attach a PoW proof to each commit. When merging branches, you’d not only reconcile file differences but also verify the corresponding PoW proofs. A branch with a valid PoW trail would be inherently more trustworthy. This maintains the properties of distributed consensus within the familiar tools and workflows of Git.

In short, this shattered PoW concept lets you maintain the strong trust guarantees of proof-of-work in a more modular, token-free, and portable form. It provides a mechanism for fragmentation and later reconvergence of the ledger’s state, all while retaining globally verifiable integrity.
