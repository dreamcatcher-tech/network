When designing experiments, use synths to see if the survey or data points respond to proposed experiments.

Can play very cheaply with ideas, and only commit real resources when are sure of the response.
Share with others so can double up on the studies - look for ways to pack more info into the research, and then create a marketplace to do multiple parallel studies.

Can have an HR app that models staff, and lets people test out approaches of things they're thinking about doing, and models the effects on other staff, so a wholistic view.

General platform should be using LLMs to simulate people.
