more than per user preference honing, if we get told something that might be a user covering a flaw in the model, we can update our knowledge base with it, where the knowledge augments any given model.

We can test it by testing the flop of a deprompted model on this topic, and if it scores badly, we add that to the internal knowledge of the model.

Can include htings like what acronyms mean what, etc.
