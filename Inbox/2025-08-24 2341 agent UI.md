so down the side is a list of agent interactions / sessions that are happening.
it is like the chat list in chatgpt, but just a little more fancy, with some stats on status, number of children, etc.
when you click on it, you can see the chat in the stateboard, and can browse children.

so you can jump around between them, and they're just chats with agents.

you can click on some agents to have a chat or resume your last chat with a particular agent, which brings up its stateboard differently.

shortcut will create a new session or resume the last one, dep if hold ctrl.

the agent stream is what it's doing in the background, and hat its children are doing.

stateboards are what you can click on to get more info out.
