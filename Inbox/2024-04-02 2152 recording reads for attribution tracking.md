We need to be able to know which text was read when, and how much that contributed to the overall output of the system.  Which data, and which bot prompts were the most valuable.

Then we need to model for the system substrate, like deno depoy, the attribution system, and the AI models in use.

These systems need to have encapsulations, so that we can box up a hugely complex thing, like owing all of prior history for the computer, and these can be routed and discovered incrementally as our knowledge horizon of agreed attribution expands.

We can get bots to start the task of calculating what the attribution to various characters in history should be, and recovering historical information about resource allocations to figure out who is owed what.
