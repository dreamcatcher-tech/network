if we present the exact same interface as the Artifact provider, but instead we are watching these calls and relaying only the ones that are allowed by the permissions of the current runtime.

Additionally, to help the building of these components, we should make tools that allow for the construction of easy-in-browser mocks of back-end data so that the page can be developed as a static page, making it much easier than connecting up a back-end service. 

And so a framed napp wouldn't really know if it had genuine artifact access or jailed access. It would still make the exact same protocol calls. Which are all just JSON objects anyway.
