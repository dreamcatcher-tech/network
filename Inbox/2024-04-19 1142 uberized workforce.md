Ideally want to do recruitment of staff, where we take a cut each month, but we handle the staff member.  They come with AI tools and elastic workforce training, where they are commissioned when work flows thru them to external providers.  The goal is to transform the company into an elastic consumer, rather than fixed staff members.
