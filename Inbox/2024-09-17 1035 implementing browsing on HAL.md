I wanna be able to have my browsing happen in the platform? Be able to open multiple tabs, multiple pages, and then be able to talk about the things I want from any given page, have that automatically passed should mean that the summaries are given to me live And I can see some goals for the information search I've been backing on. It should also consider other goals that are adjacent perhaps not current. And then this way, my browsing can be greatly improved. I can then pass off The browsing I've done with the summaries to other team members We can browse together where we can both be driving at a page and see how pointers on the page, and we can both add to the goals, plus it's taking a snapshot of the page so that it is available always.

This means that the browsing is happening inside of the stateboard, and the AI as aware of the page, and able to offer summaries of the pages.
