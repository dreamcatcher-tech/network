Surely I should be able to set up an agent that could go out and find songs information about them, pull down the media, curate the collection, appraise the quality of the music, make sure it's not polluted or inserted with ads, and then give me what I want in the highest quality possible while making sure the artists get rewarded in some way. Surely that's possible.
