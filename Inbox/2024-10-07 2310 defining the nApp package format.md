So in our final format we would distribute it as a git branch, where that git branch was optionally shallow checked out, and make use of that Facebook compression algorithm that detects dictionary differences between files so that the repository itself was highly compressed, probably coming in as a, actually the in-app format would really be a github pack file of the snapshot of the directory. At release time we would have to handle publishing the package, we would need to define an API on how you do that, we'd define the structure of the package and provide an app that can help you bundle, different standards of running, like how do you handle billing, API access, all those kinds of things, and I think everything in the Dreamcatcher stems from that. You consume packages as the consumer, you produce them as a producer, you modify them as a user, because it's kind of easy now for you to just say what you want, and then have some of it be generated automatically, other parts of it need some thinking from you, and other parts are handled by far away people at some later stage. Guaranteed to have blockchain style guarantees for your execution environment, no one owns your data, you make contributions, it all just gets attributed to fairly, so we need to somehow include attribution in the NAP package format.

Defining extra capabilities like consensus in nApps ? specifying what substrate they run on ?

Putting the whole thing on a blockchain that has a consensus model would be beautiful.

nApp dependencies would be git objects, and so you could cache them easily.

Must include payments deep in the network.

Mount the dependent napps in a specific location within this napp.
