Inside the globe is a magnetic ring that the base uses to clasp it and to rotate it.  The base has small wheels that give it frictionless movement.  Optical encoder so we know where it has been rotated.

Base can rotate vertically based on the seasons, then project the season down on the table around it.

Make it always show the correct time of day by laser pointer on the earth showing where is midday but marked so we know the time from it.

Control by bluetooth so can dial up a specific location and rotation.  Turn your phone around to control the device.

Battery source could be in the globe, and the base just provides wireless power.

Fast forward to a specific day, either shortcut or by doing every rotation that would occur.
