If we state what we are trying to do, then the bot can help us work towards that better, and helps our own organization so we can see what is going on.

Sync between threads so the context stays up to date, and show when it was updated in the thread so we know when it changed externally - this would update live, and we could choose to not use the latest context.

May make a tree that shows all the current work on what areas or scopes of the projects, and how many tokens are burning, so we can see at a glance how much is being done.

When we have multiple people working on an AI driven project, showing where all the tokens are burning is essential.
