If we could switch from working on customers to making each customer be a bot, then our system is talking to the customer directly to ask information and schedule things ?

Can be emphathetic of the customer, and express to us the complaints and wishes the customer might have, like if they have been contacted too frequently, or if they've been calling up a lot.
