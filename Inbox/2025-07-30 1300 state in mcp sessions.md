this could be exposed as a resource ?
the files being acted upon can be  consumed ?

mcp seems similar to what we're doing since it is exactly the api a bot needs, so it can be what a human needs, but it isn't set up like that.
perhaps a cli might feel more natural ?

we need to have a concept of the selected mcp server, and this should show up in the state or something, so that the llm knows it has navigated to something different, and now it has different tools available.

expose resources to show what napp is currently in scope ?
also show what the scope is ?
