If the pubco was raised so that it was actually the backer of the workforce, then it would be a contracting company which sold services in an open manner.

Services company that marks up the labour it sells, using the NFT system as a marketplace for it to promote itself.

We would be offering up the platform, but also managing the workforce that builds apps upon it.  We would bootstrap that workforce by using it to build out the platform itself, and seek to find customers who want work done using it.  These customers would pay for the services, where the pubco would take a cut of those payments, then as the applications earned revenues, the pubco could take a cut of that more passive income.  Support for the applications is charged for in the same way.  Any additional worker capacity is used by the company to build out its platform offerings.

In this way we would slowly progress towards having a public blockchain offering that can run AI models natively on decentralized hardware, providing an alternative to ethereum and bitcoin for decentralized compute, while competing with amazon on price point.  Ultimately, we will have enough capability and enough data to train an AI that can calculate royalties for the NFTs, and at this point we would be the fairest possible marketplace for software labour on the planet.

By using the packet system as a way to engage with customers, we are effectively taking a cut of their future revenues.
