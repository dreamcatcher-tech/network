When parts of the knowledge pool are attempted to be altered, your bot can give you an opinion on whether it things the proposal is better or worse.  Having this opinion should increase the rate of change signficantly.

Sets of questions we would ask it are:
1. what changed since last time ?
2. simulate this proposal for me
3. what was the participation level of the last vote ?
