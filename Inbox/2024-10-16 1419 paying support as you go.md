insurance pools, stake, some goes to the software producers.

Make a system where you can pay for the running of the software that includes an insurance fee that guarantees the software will run correctly and bug free.

Also the hosting is fault free.

When you pay these higher amounts, there is a pool that takes the other side of the bet, and stakes against faults. 

Some of the payment goes to profit share for the software, to incent fixes.

People don't mind to pay for the reliability to be lively.  They don't want to pay for dead software that doesn't change.  And if something goes wrong they want their money back.
