Whenever we are about to set an address, then we need to call the geocoding API.
If the input comes in, then we should geocode it automatically.

Attempt to geocode directly first, and then present the stateboard showing the component that lets them geocode directly.  This tool would have an address entry, and then let the user type in the field until they are happy with it.  Back in the chat window, there would be a button that would be live updated with the result of the geocoding that they would hit once they are happy with it.

Queries:

Show me all geocoded customers.

Run geocoding on all these customers.
