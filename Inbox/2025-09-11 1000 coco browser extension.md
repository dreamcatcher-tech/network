a small extension that provides good at a glance views of the certification of all the confidential components, like GPU and computers.

the tls termination, but also the sub agent terminations within the computer.

it could also store the signing keys of the computer you're running on, so that you can authenticate yourselve to the trusted environment.

can act a bit like metamask, where it can present operations for signing ?

actually the signing need not happen on the browser, all you need is access.

the signing can happen inside your confidential environment.

so we gift you some basic access to the system, as a way to introduce people, then they need to pay to have more coco resources.

so the client becomes super lightweight, and needs hardly any backend, since it simply jacks in the browser to the confidential computer, and at that point, all workload happens server side.

metamark has a massive backend, and a large codebase to trust.

we would have no such issue, we don't need to deliver anything to the browser, we don't need to inject into web pages.
the browser looking outwards is running inside our trusted computing environment, so a page or external agent wanted to get transactions approved is going thru server side computer, not local.

injecting scripts into web pages doesn't really work.  
if a remote entity wants to ask a payment, the visitor would expose a one time address or something for it to connect to.

> we could shard the confidentiality, so that we could allow operations that occur under another confidential environment to them be reconsumed in our environment, with the intermediate data not being visible to us.

So like an auditor that blanks its memory when it leaves.

we can avoid all the overhead of wallets like metamask having to inject things into web pages, as in this model, the browser only needs to auth with the coco environment, and then all that heavy stuff happens server side, so the client stays ultra light and very hard to compromise, since it only talks to a confidentialÂ server
