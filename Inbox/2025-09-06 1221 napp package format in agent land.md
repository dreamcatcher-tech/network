agent land is where we need config to set up an agent.

so the mcp servers that the agent has, this is what the napps might be ?

they could be services, where they are genuinely remote, or they could be code that runs at the mount point.

one could just load up the tools alone.

the tools are no longer the centrepoint.

the package io is really just files now, since it needs no special artifact code.

mutable spaces can be shared around by way of NFS.

so actually, the napp package format is indeed the agent format, since it has all the things we need ?

the sysprompt was part of it.
the config for the agent might have been actually part of the initial config, since the type of the agent is import.

the config for faces and default faces is important.

we had a notion of a default tool, but this probably applies to views and things too.

so and agent would be defined as a napp package.

the mcp tools available to the agent are really what the tools list in the mcapp were for.
