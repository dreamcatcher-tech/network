We should launch with ability to do comparisons between other frameworks, so that we have all the options people might choose contained within us.  We can remark on the attribution policies of all, and the portability.  So by being the place to maintain comparisons and be able to chat about them all, we also surface the issues of attribution, portability, sovereignty, programmablility, and show where there are capitalist incentives that will always seek to charge a lot and cripple the competition, where it relies on competition to keep prices fair.

When people chat, they are expanding what we know, since they change how our knowledge base reacts.

Probably these self creation platforms will be all that is left, since they are app frameworks that have been used to generate ai apps that have replaced every other form of software.
