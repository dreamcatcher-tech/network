These would be a stopgap before we got our own firecracker install.

We would form them to have the same napps interface so there is an internal market running with the service dimensions of transmission, latency, compute (cpu, gpu, quantum, fpga), storage.

so people could run their own hosts locally, either by running a docker container that runs docker on docker, their own firecracker machine or cluster, or whatever else people want to set up, so long as it adheres to the interface.
