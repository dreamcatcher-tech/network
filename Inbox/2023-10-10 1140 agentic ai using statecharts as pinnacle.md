If an agent group was tasked with taking in all the natural language feedback of a bunch of humans, and they worked amongst themselves to generate a statechart with actions, and a list of conflicts based on what the humans said, this could alleviate the time consuming pain of statecharts, and once the human agrees the statechart is complete, this serves as the governing reference for the rest of the application work, so that everything done must incorporate into this statechart.

"ensure that I can generate a test of x y z"

Ends up being a series of instructions and conditions and the AI works thru many generative iterations to produce a statechart that passes all logic checks, and does what the user wants.

User can lock pieces of code that they like, so the machine will work around these constraints.
