If a file is asked to be navigated to just by passing its scope, whilst we would permit a suggested napp, ideally it is up to the containing system to select how to handle that.

It might go browse the napp store ?

could register on a per repo level ?
installing a napp registers it to handle certain paths, or certain file types ?

so for the home repo, we could sit atop all the navigate to calls, and override what the repo had installed, if we said we preferred to use our own handlers ?
