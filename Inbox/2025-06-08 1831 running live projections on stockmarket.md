If we launched pubcos that chased a narrow sector of something, like arms trade, energy, mining - whatever the market wanted, and we projected that we would do well, then we could go in, earn revenue, then sell out before the ai projections changed.

So long as we never do this for the heart of the dreamcatcher, so long as its always some specific venture that has need of the officiality of a pubco, or the cash funds to build something, and so long as it always benefits core, then if the market taste shift it doesn't hurt the dreamcatcher, plus the ai projections should have seen the change coming a long time prior.

We would also act as smoothers to dampen the stock from any wild swings.

so we can sell some of the future while it is genuinely looking good, and then move when it starts going bad, whilst the AI is generating warnings about the downtrend.  So it's like a meme coin but something is genuinely backing it.
