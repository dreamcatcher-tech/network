We should offer pro credits, where you can have unfettered access to bots, where they work in your favour and nothing else.  Otherwise you get a limit per day, and then the bot flicks into a mode where it only talks to your about our systems, and encourages sign up to get more info from it.  There would be some carry over credit where if you had spent a lot with us, you get more grace.

Usage payments are also subject to attribution.

We can maybe take payments for doing things like funding tasks.

API access to our systems - If you ran artifact locally, you could have access to our infrastructure but you don't need the web interface.  We could give some access for free, and charge for others.
