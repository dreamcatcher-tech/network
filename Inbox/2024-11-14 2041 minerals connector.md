If we stockpiled ore, it is easier to protect.
The cost of refining will probably get cheaper over time.
The value of the mineral will go up, definitely.
The cost of extracting new ore will go up too, as scarcity and politics and conservation and land rights go up.
So makes more sense to vault the ore than the mineral.

make a connector system that uses AI to map out all the mineral productions round the world, and at what price, and then start communicating and cutting deals to connect up suppliers to buyers for a fee.

May make a listing system for complicated deals using AI to craft solutions and optimizations.
