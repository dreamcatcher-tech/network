Using LLM seems to make all problems be continuous time, and in fact, the hardest problems seem to be ones that are three factors or mechanical changes to a project or the pattern. It's a little hard to describe. 

It is much more useful to know what the programmer was trying to do or planning to do. Being able to constantly have the programmer shout out what they're going to do, keep watching the changes, and notice when they've strayed off course. Update the plan accordingly.

So the plan is basically broadcast every time there's a commit. The plan gets re-broadcast as to what they're looking at doing next.
