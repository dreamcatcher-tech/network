`@self` is a reserved agent id, which means you are talking to yourself.

or, you could use your own genuine id ?

but best, since otherwise you need to use a relative or absolute path, or just basic posix path resolutions.

we have our own path resolver that is posix compliant.

self is a good special way to call your own self, and then do your own face and agent management.
