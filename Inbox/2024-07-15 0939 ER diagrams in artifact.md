The diagram provides an internal reasoning tool.  The rules of the business should be listed, but they need to be listed using a standard dictionary of terms and relationships.  The ER diagram provides a way to reconcile all the rules against one another, and to present the overall extracted rules to the humans.

The ER diagram should never be editable directly, but rather, requires a rule to be added that changes the diagram.

The rules are checked each time any action occurs.  The diagram checked too, but more to ensure the relationships were maintained.

So the rules get entered in the top, and some user stories are generated.
Then when people actually use it, further user stories and stucks are generated as the users complain or the bots detect friction.

Basically systems that take the chance of hallucination and multiply it, so the reliability goes up above a certain level.

Upgrading the ERD / transitioning to a new one could be tricky ? would require rerunning testing, as well as the new types of tests that we would expect to change.  Make the old tests fail and so you work to change these tests and the ERD, then hit upgrade.

System visits every record to see if it is in compliance.
