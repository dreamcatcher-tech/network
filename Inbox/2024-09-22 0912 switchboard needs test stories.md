Without capturing how switchboard is supposed to behave in tests, we can amplify the thrashing of an already difficult space.

We need some tools to pull together research about different methods, and a way to appraise them for our given use cases.

Once we can do that, we can have an edge at being the quickest to implement any given approach, and a way for people to test and select different ones.  So even for a theoretical approach, we can mock it up rapidly in an automatic way, and we can collate the research on the area to help implementors come up with ideas.

Finally, collaboration on this topic is made more possible by our platform.
