This should be the same for all types of search - thread, agent, file

For big files, have a strategy to break / sample them and write summaries.

For directories, these should be a summary of all the files in the directory, which is rolled up from the bottom.

if we make a `.dreamcatcher` folder in the root of each branch, then this is where we store index info, `.io.json` and other files of interest.
