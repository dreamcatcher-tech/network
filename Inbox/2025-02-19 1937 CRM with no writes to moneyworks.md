It would simply read, and optionally it would reset itself back to moneyworks reference.

Moneyworks would stay syncing the reads.

What about downloading all of moneyworks ?

Reset of the crm just copies the oids of the table names straight over, or, just set an object named 'moneyworks' to the tree oid of the mw branch, giving us an instant copy.

We need not be stuck with the moneyworks data structure.

But its probably perfectly good enough.  So we'd import as moneyworks, and then modify into our own format, with reference back to the document in moneyworks that was used ?
