When chatting in real time, what I would expect to see is the input box for the command history. Should be continually updated to allow me to correct the things that I've said. So I'm really using the voice to compose intelligently a message and I might expect it to go through some diffs. 

The diff should be communicated to me either with selection changes or color highlighting or some kind of fading into the distance indicating what the changes were. Since it's real time, I think the fade effect is suitable here. And basically I chat back and forth until I'm ready to send the command. In some cases I would expect the bot to decide that this is the command to do. This might be a case where the command is known to the real time bot so it can simply execute. 

In other cases I would expect to see the stateboard alter. I would expect to see selection on the stateboard alter. And in the background I would expect to be able to click a button that pops up and shows the genuine voice chat that's happening in the background. So kind of like a mini sliding modal that comes up from the prompt. Maybe it's underneath the prompt to show me what was last said. This should also have a scrubbable timeline so I can jump between speech segments and replay them and then select them and play them back. 

Or we could choose to show this thing on the stateboard. It might be able to be shown underneath the prompt. So the prompt represents a membrane in time where from the very bottom of the page real time speech is coming up and up and up and then ultimately being transformed into the prompt. And then the prompt is going down and down and down away from the prompt in the command history.

The realtime could tear and cancel calls to the deeper agents, if it felt it needed to update or alter what was asked, or if the user recognized a mistake and wanted to redo their actions.
