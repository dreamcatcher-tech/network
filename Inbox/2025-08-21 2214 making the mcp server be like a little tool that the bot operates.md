so give it a dedicated panel.
flick a mode where the model will fill it out and stop, but the human presses go.

human can fill out the model and can browse around the tools.

This is basically the UI of the mcp.

so the state of the mcp server is snapshotted at each point, so you can see where it was at each time.
the state might be represented as a single hash, so that it can be retrieved, rather than being stored in two places.

so this little computer that it goes racing around the world with, it takes a snapshot where it was at, at each point, and we can recreated it if it is an artifact compatible mcp server, which means the state is represented by a hash.  possibly a branch, so if you want to fork.
