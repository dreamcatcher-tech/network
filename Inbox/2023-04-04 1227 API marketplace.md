If we provide API wrappers that are blockchains, then people can make and publish apps that do not require the devs to run servers at all, since the client is responsible.  Servers also do not need to hold any secret material, since the client handles all this.

Seems a better way to let devs build apps, since they get paid anyway, and get paid when people remix things as well.  NFT tooling is a good way to get blockchain familiar people involved in the project.
