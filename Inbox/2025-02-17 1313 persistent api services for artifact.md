To be able to do something like torrenting, we need a long lived tcp / udp connection.  We could make gateways that handle this and then turn the packets into napp actions, so that a long lived connection can be held, but in the background it is a serverless swarm.

Like torrents.

But it might be better to do torrents directly, and then just use artifact for the data.
