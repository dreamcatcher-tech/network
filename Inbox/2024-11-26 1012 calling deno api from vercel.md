Could generate an api key which is treated as a secret on the vercel infra, and is required as auth in the deno infra.

So deno would reject anything that was not verified.

Deno would store the account balances, and would deduct from those balances.

Additionally, might be able to call vercel from deno to get arbitrary code execution ?
