If we start a particular task with multiple efforts at parallel, we can periodically run cheap calls to a logic model (O3MiniHigh) to ask to rank all of the submissions wherever they're currently up to so that they can be stack-ranked.

The importance of each one in the UI would show this as the proposed changes having winning and losing props. There would be a best one and then an idea of how much better than the other ones. As the generation continues, these will jiggle around until ultimately one will be seen to be the clear win where we can stop all the others. 

They should probably be permitted to flop before their presentation and taste is altered in any way.
