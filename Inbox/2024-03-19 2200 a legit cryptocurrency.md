If we could run a ledger of accounts, and have many vendors that handled local kyc and compliance in a uniform manner, then we could make a currency between them that was backed by bonds and other assets in vaults in different jurisdictions.

Then we could do credit card processing and other transfers that were instant and low risk, and intrinsically compliant.  Govt may not be able to achieve this, but a private enterprise that was opt in may do so.

Can offer payments with no minimum, and no percentage cut.  Offer stable banking where you will not get debanked instantly, because we were actually paying attention the whole time - you will receive definitive answers on all activities.

Then can start netting balances out in countries to avoid FS exchanges.
