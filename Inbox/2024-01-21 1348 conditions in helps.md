We should test the helps for relevance by specifying some context.

Context would be when to use this, or some pre-requisites.

the problem is that the context of the question is only available to the goalie, not the help finder.

So the goalie needs to know how to pass on some summary context to the help finder.

We have so many options for constructing a system in this way that we need some form of top level evals to see which architectures perform the best for the end user results we want to see.

We need to be able to keep multiple parallel architectures going so that we never have to commit to a single one, and may be able to switch to different ones depending on the context.
