It would not be a script, since scripts are fallible, but rather it would be voice authenticated Q&A session with the student.

It would know to probe at areas it suspected weakness, so hoping you wouldn't get asked about something is a waste of time.

The exam could be continuous, and would be happening as you worked with the AI every day, and it would ultimately say that you were ready. 

It would test competency on a regular basis during professional career.


Can use this to run company quizes so we are constantly testing staff lack of knowledge and mapping areas of weakness.  Based on emails, instead of correcting, it asks probing questions about something, massaging out dissonance in team members.

Dissonance is a chance to reach a deeper understanding, so should be debated thru.
