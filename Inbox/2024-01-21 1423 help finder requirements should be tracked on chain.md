As we learn more about what we wish certain things did, these should be placed in files and linked to the help files in question.  So that feature requesting happens on chain, and is subject to some AI discussion and some back and forthing.  We would use the email format for messages in this case.

We might be able to use the email format as a way to manage session files, since they could be more easily summarized and grouped, and also have threading ?

Whenever a new feature is requested, we should engage a bot that helps to define what that is.

We can also run assessments in the background that draw our attention to areas that failed, and give some light feedback to the user that we have noted our failure and are working on it.
