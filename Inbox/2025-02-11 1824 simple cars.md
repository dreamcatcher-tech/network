Make it with a very small battery that charges quickly, maybe with high super capacitor ratio.

Have a lightweight generator block that can be used to run the car, or generate any other kind of electricity.

So for short trips round town, just leave the generator at home, so lighter weight.

Can also insert battery packs that would otherwise be used to drive your house.

Make generator run on multiple different kinds of fuel efficiently.

Cost is greatly reduced, so is weight.  Battery capacity is useful as a home battery during most of the time, then can swap them out at home if you need extra range, or if you don't want to charge.

Plus can carry them all off to a supercharger and bring them back.

Make the car cheaper still by removing the brakes, and just using regen plus motors.
