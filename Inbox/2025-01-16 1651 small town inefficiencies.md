I wonder if we could generate a set of equations to estimate the inefficiencies in any given person's data. So if we took a very small suburb like Davenport, and estimated what the purpose of all the car journeys was, then we should be able to show that there's some inefficiency factor which must be similar across all cities. And if we have a fix for that, then in general, due to the increased quality of life and lowering of cost, if we can supply that type of service, that highly coordinated, highly efficient service, perhaps people would prefer it more. These would be options like, instead of each restaurant having its own stores of cold food and beverages and things, there would be a central repository in the main town that does automated rapid deliveries between all the businesses, so that they share all the costs of ordering refrigeration. The wastage is reduced. And then when stockists come, they simply load up crates into this large store.

If we could implement smart drawers here, then the residents could tap it directly too, and so we have a cloud kitchen type set up.
