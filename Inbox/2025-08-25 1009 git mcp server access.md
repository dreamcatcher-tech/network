this would let us have an agent that specialized in creating PRs by browsing the repo, browsing the issues, looking at branch history, and only then deciding on the feature to implement.

It might try a few things and give us some options.

we could detect when tools have changed and add some status into the prompt so the machine is 'jogged' to know what's going on.

hook in the discord server using an mcp connection.

add the fetch server, so pages can grab things in.  bots can negotiate with each other until a reasonable view of a page is established.  Can use consensus algos like casper.
