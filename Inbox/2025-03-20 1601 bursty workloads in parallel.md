A major advantage of our platform is being able to run multiple versions of a codebase / problem, in parallel, and compare them all.

All current models we know of use a single user model.

We would model a team of workers, all trying to solve the problem uniquely, in a git branch, with the winner being selected.

This can be leveraged for parallel computing, but also parallel problems solving.
