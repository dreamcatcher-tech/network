the boundary of an agent should be the mutable space that it thinks within ?

So there can be an unlimited number of sessions, but there is only one mutable space, or working context.

if the repo is the same, then the agent spins up and might be restricted to a cone within it.

at the top, there is a root agent that controls everything the container is doing ?

the key is to hold a model where the mutability bounds are set by the agent.

so an agent is a container.

if you need different mutability bounds you should start a new agent instance.

the countainer is the unit of mutability / transience / pooling.
