If the attachments button was used as the way to open the chat context window, 

The issue is that if you add a folder, and some urls, and some artifacts, then how should the model handle this context ?

Embeddings are bad, so being able to read each file and decide, in parallel, if it is relevant, seems best.

May digest into short summaries, which are not embeddings, but act in a similar way.

The model should be able to loop to dig for more context, and the context digger should run while the progress ai is describing what it is doing, sort of like how o1 does its reasoning.



corporations in the gateway companies would be the first prototypes of the AI operator, where they let you do anything at all, you are instantly compliant, and it can talk with you about why.  We all add to it and learn from it, but it allows you to start a company instantly. 

The shared gateway model means that costs are reduced greatly, but also various services can be shared across all companies, like filing annual reports.  Makes shutdown easy, and dormancy free.  Mergers and forks are easy - like github but for companies.

Might also help obscure individual success or failure if we have to declare profit and loss.

Trading partners can have confidence the system is reliable to trade with.
