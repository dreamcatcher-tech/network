If we integrate livekit, then we can also have video and voice calls, and SIP telephony, as well as the realtime api.

PLUS we can connect the realtime bots up to SIP calls, so we can telephone in and talk to one of the bots.

Could make a service where you just phone in and ask for things to be done, and get back some pricing or whatever.

If you have an account, the phone call could do jobs for you, like prepare messages, or read your emails, or something else.

TRiggering a phone call when something important happens.

Driving in a car would need a GPU based model that could handle responses when offline, and queue up deeper intelligence for when your can send and receive these heavier messages back.

Bot would always get given the running task list each new prompt from the user, or the bot can call a local function to check the status.

Basically turns the live interactive into async heavy operations, that are well suited for offline intermittent network use.
