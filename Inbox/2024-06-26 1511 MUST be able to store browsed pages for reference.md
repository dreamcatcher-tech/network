We should be able to store them in a shared place, browsed using trusted isolates.

Use the fast version to get something going, then if we want, escalate to be a trusted version, and possibly a waybackmachine version too.

This locks the info, and makes it shareable.  Plus we can point to it when we want to make references, and everyone can know they are seeing the same thing.

Any new readers can be alerted when their browsed view is different in some way.

This should accrue attribution for these things when they get used.

Do a scrape using puppeteer and store the rendered html too.
Also store a screenshot.
Then use image recognition to transform the screenshot into markdown.
Or use something like turndown service to attempt to transform to markdown.
Then use a scraping service as well to see if better quality is returned.  These reference options should be sufficient to work from or derive things.
