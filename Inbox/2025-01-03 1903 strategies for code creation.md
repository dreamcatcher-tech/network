Make a math spec
declare how to create files for this
make a project map out of this list of files

As the code files are rendered out, we would observe faults or wishes, which would then go back up the top of the funnel and might change the math formula, or the readme or something else that is top level, then it would get reconciled down to the outer levels.

So basically, as we start talking, we would start attempting to generate, and only when the approach materially changes would we start a new thread.  If we find that threads started earlier are now invalidated, we cancel them.  This is full speculative mode.
