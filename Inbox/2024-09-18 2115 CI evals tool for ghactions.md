We should make a continuous integration evals tool Well, as long as you can expose your box to us far an API, we can allow you to write and help you write tests that exercise multiple iterations against your bots and present the output in a TPS report. That includes thousands of variations of things that your users might use against your system. Every time there's a change to your repository of any kind, we can automatically fire up your repo in in a a using our multi threaded system, it can also act as a load generator if you specify the number of servers or services that you wanna run then we can hit it with enough load and record the saturation. Acting like also a benchmark as well as A Correctness tool. Finally, we may convince you that writing your bots on our platform is better We can allow our platform to integrate with GitHub based workflows So that the publication still goes through standard gatekeeping checks. To review a PR is actually an independent process that should be done by a machine as well as some spot checks on some test iterations before running the expensive full suite.

This is a viable product that we can offer for consumption.
