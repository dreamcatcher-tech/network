use 1inch and others to place orders, and just earn from the oscillations the price does.

work out an optimization for how many oscillations are required to make a win.
If we think it keeps oscillating a bit, but we want to catch a breakout, we can structure our position accordingly.

we can use the 1inch pools to know a proxy for how the overall market sentiment is moving.

earning 3% per week is pretty good ?

we can look at how much we can afford to lose, to set the pricing agressively ?
make models that tell us the chance of particular movements.
