thepennyinc.com allows royalty payments to be sent to a large number of cards, so we could use them to do payment processing for royalty payments.

If we paid on chain using a coin we issue, then redemption can go straight into peoples card balances that can be immediately spent on the card networks.

We could do an entirely credit card backed NFT, where it was funded using cards, paid out using cards, and then royalty payments went out using cards.
