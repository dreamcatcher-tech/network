thepennyinc.com allows royalty payments to be sent to a large number of cards, so we could use them to do payment processing for royalty payments.

If we paid on chain using a coin we issue, then redemption can go straight into peoples card balances that can be immediately spent on the card networks.

We could do an entirely credit card backed NFT, where it was funded using cards, paid out using cards, and then royalty payments went out using cards.

This can allow a cut for the people making the proposals.  Means we can have a distributed team of people making proposals, and if the proposals came from on chain, we can be assured they had some level of quality checking done.  Can run an AI checker over it, or can have human QA.  Investors can pay for QA and proposers to generate these things, in exchange for the upside cut.

Can use LLMs to generate proposals based on all the other proposals to date, particularly ones that have been successful.  Case studies are live packets.
