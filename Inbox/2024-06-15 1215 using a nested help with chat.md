If writing an email, and HAL asks some clarifying definition questions, then you would start the definitions piece in a child help, so as not to pollute the session.

When in this help, you would be conversing about a dedicated topic.

HAL would present the things required as a series of uninvoked / unclosed helps.  The help agents are intended to conclude, but not change the state of the agent.

The sessions are ephemeral, as in they do not have a change on the state of the agent that is running them - they are single session agents.

An immutable agent is one that will not accept changes to itself ?

Switches the UI to now send in prompts to this session, which then concludes and passes the result back up.  We could re-enter it later to continue on.

HAL would treat the conclusion like a file output, and it needs several of these completed before it does the final mix, so you could jump back in and continue where you left off with one of these sessions, and then the output would be different but no need to recalculate everything.

These finished knowledge nuggets go into your filesystem.

The key is treating files as bots, and you can modify the bot, and then include these bots when you want to do something.  The bots track when they got used and how, so you can keep working on them to refine and make succinct under different angles of interrogation and consumption.

So for a DAO proposal, the proposals would be these bots that people could come and work on, fork them if they are materially different.

So instead of files, you have these stateful agents.
