Even tho the DreamEther contract is open, we want control over who we use as the minter, 
So that means that a proposal should state which minter it wants to use as well.

We need some way to make it open to anyone to use, but still control what gets listed on opensea and what carries our brand name.  Or, just control it all.

It should be able to mark some funds as credit card uncleared - so a lock, a reason, a timeout, where that timeout can be set based on blocktime, or by a second transaction.
