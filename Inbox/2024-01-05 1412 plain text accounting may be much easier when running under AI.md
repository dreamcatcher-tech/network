Means we could scan receipts, have discussions, import complex docs, and all the while output a format that has known good parsers and report generations.

We could use this ledger in the CRM, since we know we can write to the text files easily, but we have in them a format enforcer.

Each customer could have a ledger entry for their own balances.

Probably report generation could be componentized too.
