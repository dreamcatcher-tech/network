relies on the effect of a rotating cylinder to have air stick to it, so it can be forced to go thru a narrow part of the tube, causing compression, then fuel is added, and mixture expands.

So a sort of jet engine, but going round a high speed cylinder.

Hopefully more quite, and far simpler to make, and more durable.

Change compression ratios by altering the combusion chamber geometries.

Another similar design is to use the spining to push air outwards, sucking in down the centre of the tube.  As the cylinder rotates, the opening is covered, and then ignition maybe ?
