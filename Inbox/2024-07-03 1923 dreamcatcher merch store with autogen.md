By using the print on demand service, we can offer merch with our branding, but we can also attach custom AI generated art, or text with style.

Can get the NFTs of tasks made large.

Make each item have its own NFT and QR code for provenance.

People can make their own stores and own items to be sold.

Can sell them with the NFTs attached as collections, like the card, the shirt, and the coffee mug.

Ideally we would then support buying and selling any service under the sun.
