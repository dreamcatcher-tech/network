If we allow commits to start execution as fast as possible, rather than waiting for all executions at a certain ring to complete, this would be faster, but we now have different commits depending on timing of the computers.

If we knew that there was tension and we set keyframes when each tension ring was complete, we could compress the commits down once the keyframe had completed, even tho we could start running tasks quicker than that.

This makes it important to deny any of these tasks to make any decisions based on the state of the tree ?

Theory is that if we have waited for all tasks, it should have had the exact same result back.
