Make a bootloader MD file that gets loaded up with the sys prompt.
Make some base files that are in the stuckloop directory, so that they can be pulled in.


Replay of past AI interactions by rolling forwards commits in the chain.  This should be hooked into storybook interactions, so you can do this dynamically, and make changes / add new steps.

Provide our own version of interactions in the tool itself ?

? how we make little functions that are ai based functions, that can then be composed in libraries ?
Each one should have a format including some tests, some config, some context.
Are these little functions all that is required ? if we can tell it to load a file, and run it as instructions, or run instructions and load up another file, or create a loop over some range of files, with the lens function, then we should be able to do anything ?
```js
lens( glob, functionPath, outputFile )
```
Then what a function is, is some info about how to call an AI, and what to prompt it with, and maybe some session info ?  Or is there a different type of call that includes session ? Or is there not really any session info, and its just a conversion process from md to json calls ?

How does a commit get related to a function ?
how many concurrent executions should be allowed before a commit occurs ?

Globbing should let it tweak its globs until the list looked right, and then pass that on to the lensing.

Should the session file itself be parsed by AI to present it as the prompt to higher models ?
This would then create an external action that was enacted by the tooling to call the actual AI?
Means anything in this sequence is tunable - so whats the minimum needed to ensure everything is tunable right from the start ?

The bootai is a gpt3.5 turbo version that simply parses the bootai.md file into the sysprompt that gets used in sysprompt.txt which serves as a caching mechanism, and will be regenerated if a change is made to the `bootai.md` file.
Provide a safeword to reset the system back to default, or to last known good, or to some version in git.  This would pop up a modal for the prompt runner

So the prompt runner is a guaranteed stable concept, and all that matters is how we handle this.
The concept of git is inescapable, and so the git tooling is provided at all times.
The stateboard is always present, and is handled by its own file which is rendered out to then be rendered by some dynamically loaded components, that are pulled in as required.

You can reset the whole system to its default state by rolling back head, or completely wipe the git repo and start again, losing everything.  Modal lets you walk back thru the bootloaders until you see something you like, and then use that.

## Sequence
Load up the git filesystem
If no boot repo, create it.
See if any tension is in the system - side effects not yet executed.
wait for the users input.


When the user says something, use goaling to use the stuck loop, which is set up in the boot loader file

The first app should extract out the sysprompt from the md file, so we can have comments, instructions, and the like out, and then we can use this as the sys prompt in a clean session.

??? where is a session stored ?

Might need a loop to ensure json format for parts of the tooling that need to interact with the outside world or call code in the system.  The amount of code we should need to run the base system should be incredibly limited.

It it one file per message, or is the whole thing a file ?

If using git files, then each commit represents a message, so we can show branching like when a tool does something, so you can see inside these paths optionally.

## Standard form of function specs
Might have a link to some actual code that we can run
Might have some NL instructions

Prompt can get piped to other locations, based on config.
Can be given a template to fill in for the prompt, to allow text files to specify the format of any other place we would like to pipe the prompt into.  Can be used to make AI calls out to any location.
