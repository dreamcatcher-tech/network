Make a bootloader MD file that gets loaded up with the sys prompt.
Make some base files that are in the stuckloop directory, so that they can be pulled in.


Replay of past AI interactions by rolling forwards commits in the chain.  This should be hooked into storybook interactions, so you can do this dynamically, and make changes / add new steps.

Provide our own version of interactions in the tool itself ?

## Sequence
Load up the git filesystem
If no boot repo, create it.


See if any tension is in the system - side effects not yet executed.


Might need a loop to ensure json format for parts of the tooling that need to interact with the outside world or call code in the system.  The amount of code we should need to run the base system should be incredibly limited.

It it one file per message, or is the whole thing a file ?

If using git files, then each commit represents a message, so we can show branching like when a tool does something, so you can see inside these paths optionally.
