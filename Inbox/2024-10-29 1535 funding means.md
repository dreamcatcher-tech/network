If we ran purely off revenue, rather than an entity that is selling its stock, this might be a more peaceful path ?

The NFTs would let us raise capital, and incent others to do work.  

Sell the NFTs with no transfer rights until the output is declared as decentralized.  So the NFT sale for the things we're trading would be on chain, and the funds come in with this lock condition that you can get your money out, proportional to what has been spent so far.

So you put money in, and you can either pull it out, or wait until the platform is verified as decentralized enough that it is no longer a security, which makes it openly transferrable.

We get more movement if we are pure NFT, since we can do whatever we think is most important, without answering questions about revenue for the quarter.

So perhaps the corporation should only be for ingesting existing companies, and turning them into AI first companies, then listing their equity on our internal stockmarket.
