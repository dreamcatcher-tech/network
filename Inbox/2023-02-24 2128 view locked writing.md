Interpulses are sent targeting the latest of the chain, whatever that might be.

The intent of the action might be lost if the chain has altered, particularly if years have gone by.

We should allow setting some conditions, like min config fingerprint (covenant, validators, state the same) or ensure the chain has not moved on at all.
