So basically, we could make a set of tools and strategies and evals that can make pretty good voice recognition systems for dictation and various other things. We could package that up into a standalone app to allow people to use it like a competitor to Wispr Flow. But we can also add some extra features where the AI from your voice is actually doing some additional processing and triggering our function invocations on Artifact rather than just being a purely transcription tool.

So you might be able to start to give it commands where you're in an app and you say "Hey, here's what I want to do". Then you have some speech input and whatever else you need, and the app knows how to dig through whatever app you're in (like email) using the accessibility layer most likely. It then goes off to the Dreamcatcher system and does a bunch of computation on it. The benefits are that the costs will be low, the quality of the app should evolve very quickly, it's easily customizable, you can own and see all the stuff going on, including all the recordings and infrastructure, so you can see how it works on the inside and how your data gets treated.

But it may also allow us to do real-time operations on the voice, like compressing arms and arms having video calls or voice calls with others where the voice is compacted or modified by AI for efficient communication. Or even censored for the sake of acting as a unified group like a company. 

The real-time thing could even be answering questions, making suggestions, doing lateral thinking for you, doing some side calculations on costs, doing several background tasks, adapting your preferences and tastes. There's a lot that can be done beyond just trying to get a clean stream of speech and then format it right. You really want to be able to work with the stream because it contains intelligence (not always directly intended for the tool at hand).

Secondly, when you start doing corrections of what you wanted it to say or do, we can process those and make sure that instantly the system has adapted to your preference. These preferences become stored and ate at the pool comparable between other people and popular ones are elevated to the level of defaults. All these changes in the effort required still gain people attribution if they independently make it better and in other people start to find it useful then they will get paid
