We should be able to take any model, and get it run by the system on a per call only basis.  The hosters handle all the optimizations required to make that cost effective, the users and the devs only need to make a function call and get charged per payment.

HuggingFace requires you to run a whole set of servers to be able to have this model work for you.  It shouldn't be that hard to do.

Then the cost of running should be paid out to the model contributors using an AI attribution algorithm, which incentivizes people to make better models, and to encourage other people to use the models too, since it pays people proportionally.
