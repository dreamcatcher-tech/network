If we control the transfer of the packets, then we can allow direct purchase using credit cards.

If the funding or buying is flagged as credit card, then it doesn't get dispersed until after the chargeback period, then things should be good.

The purchase with a credit card cannot be traded ?  Or can only be traded once a lien has been released on it.

We can provide the same power using a gateway company, where you send us cash and we will purchase platform credits for you.  But we will also maintain the quality of the spend, for a fee, so that we do not get in trouble with the purchasers.
