Need a tool like codecoverage to show how well tested an agent natural language interface is.

The tests and the variations need to be expressed in some kind of coverage.

Standard tests against exploits or other types of behaviours need to be listed.

Coverage would be how much of the sysprompt was exercised ?

Can be done by breaking the sysprompt apart, and running the tests with pieces removed, and seeing if the response was similar or not, so we know what parts of the prompt are covered by what parts of the tests.
