If people want to have debate contests, then we should give tools to let people contribute easily to these debates, and let people contribute as much or as little time as they have.

Each side is always summarized using these tools, and some kind of score is kept where each side agrees on the AI to use in arbitration.  Ultimately arguments could be occuring between the AI directly, and people can watch the summarized progress.

Can be a great way to have genuine discourse about topics with commonality and differences separated cleanly.

Reckoner keeps peoples advertised opinions up to date with what they say.

Everyone is free to select their own LLMs, but if you use an LLM, you have to publish it so that others can query it, to expose any biases that might exist in it.  The format by which the system processes ingested arguments and rolls up summaries should be very standard and not really changeable, since we need to agree on something, at least.
