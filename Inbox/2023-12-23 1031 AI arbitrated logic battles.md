If people want to have debate contests, then we should give tools to let people contribute easily to these debates, and let people contribute as much or as little time as they have.

Each side is always summarized using these tools, and some kind of score is kept where each side agrees on the AI to use in arbitration.  Ultimately arguments could be occuring between the AI directly, and people can watch the summarized progress.
