If we had an easy way to hook into someones schedule, to know if they were busy, we can allow people to have bursty jobs.

Like weather dependent jobs like swim coaching.

Also resource sharing, like pools being available or not.

We would take a small cut, but it lets people work more, and more flexibly, where they just paint out their availbility.
