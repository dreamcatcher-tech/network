What is the smallest form of a packet ?

Could all computational tasks be modelled as a micropacket, and have optional funding applied ?

The QA could be a specific machine, or it could be any machine.

Packets for computation include an action, a target,, and some boundaries like execution cost.  
They can include code, or anything that can fit in a hash.
They can be done for free, or be funded by many people.
They can have an NFT generated for them, but this may cost more than the cost of the packet.

Packets can have large amounts of funding put against them.

Packets can earn funds back, so the computation can be perpetual if people find the code useful ?
