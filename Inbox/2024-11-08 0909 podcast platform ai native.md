A platform that monetizes podcasts where the podcast is voice cloned and responds to your personal information.

If you enter things about you, then the podcast is an agent, and it represents many angles on a particular topic.

Means you are influencing it by what your personal info is asking and shaping it.

Your small steering is content creation, and it happens using your personal data and your tokens, and so you get back profit share plus content tailored for you.

Get some good hosts, and then grow the platform.
