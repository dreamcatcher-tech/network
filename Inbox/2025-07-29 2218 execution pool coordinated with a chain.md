they all fire up and log in to the chain that manages them all.  This is where they receive their jobs from, by witnessing this chain, and sending their results back in.

When pressure is high, we start more machines of this class, and they pop up and take over the load.

They start to kill long running jobs to cause a restart when they need to shrink down.
Watch long jobs that have been killed before - these must be allowed to finish.
Unless we can freeze the state of something in a gvisor kernel, and transport it over ?

So the machines that manage the chains are separate to those that do the execution.  The chain managers provide the storage like a form of network storage.
