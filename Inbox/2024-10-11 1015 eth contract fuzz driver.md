If we had a model of a contract, could the AI make NL scripts that interact with it for far better coverage than we could ?

Could we curate a list of all possible combinations of interactions, and it would then drive these scenarios in the contract for us ?

Could run these tests inside a docker container, so it is controlled by artifact.

So if the eth contract was decorated in an AI model, and even within its own usage it could generate tasks, then we seem done.

If the QA function was handled by a quorum of AI processors that can all be queried and run for theoretical outcomes, then the mechanical process of escrow release

Is an agent operating on behalf of someone actually them participating ?
If the agent was supplied by an independent vendor, can we ever be accused of securities ?

The creation of the stucks can be up to anyone, but is linked to an issuer.

The funds are handled by being present in escrow.
