If we had a model of a contract, could the AI make NL scripts that interact with it for far better coverage than we could ?

Could we curate a list of all possible combinations of interactions, and it would then drive these scenarios in the contract for us ?

Could run these tests inside a docker container, so it is controlled by artifact.
