If you say "i want to add a customer" then the response should be to start using the CRM.  Then when you're in the CRM, everything can be interpreted in that context.  If you want to jump out, we can do that, but the branch would close and you could come back to it later.

So you would have multiple branches going, where you were doing multiple things at once.

These threads can be summarized and processed.

Might need to engage in long running discussions, so you should specify that.

Must be able to run the actual bot inside the stateboard, so that we can use the commissioner to pass comment on the responses that were given.
