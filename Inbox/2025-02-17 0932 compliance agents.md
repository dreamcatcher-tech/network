compliance for products in different countries is costly and time consuming.

If we do it once for one product, we should be able to offer a general solution to anyone.

Then manufacturers can use the same platform to ask questions and check about the compliance when they are making things.

The idea is that regulation is complex, and that the same agents can service multiple customers, but its better in an AI managed platform.

Can offer returns service, address contact, and other things required by the regulators.  Can be done as simply a portion of sales, and the insurance programs we offer will be proportional to that, so if you falsify amounts, then the cover is voided.  We would know this by seeing the shipping and distribution processes, which need to be overseen for compliance.

What's good about compliance is that it requires full visibility, so we know exactly what its worth to you, and can calculate a fair price based on that.

We should offer things like shipping and clearing agents, where we run a marketplace that can be switched between with independent QA providing the service triad.
