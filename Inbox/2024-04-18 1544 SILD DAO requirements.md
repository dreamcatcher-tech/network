self sovereign data
repeatable AI, so we can inspect and repeat the outputs
path to decentralization
path to offline ability
internationalization
summarizing changes in AI, with interrogations
talk to the river, or the mountain, or the driveway
island wide voluntary inventory with no overhead
task definition and costing
contribution management
automatic bookkeeping / compliance for business on the island
identity management
profit management - calculation of fair profit for enterprises on the island
simulating the dao future outlook as well as the versions of the dao
connecting up to 
generative ai proposing, with iterative improvements from anyone
checking off rules against all proposals, so no humans need to be involved, and proposers are guided
accounting for the DAO so all the planned things have a projected cost in many different dimensions
ambient coordination - if your interests are known, then we can coordinate on your behalf
finance management, like community based mortgages
automated realtime project updates
dispute resolution
2D mapping first, where the DAO can describe its situation
3D where it can act on the unreal engine version



It starts with a strong knowledge base, permanent data

We need to come up with a name - generative DAO.  Basically putting the A into DAO.

Daos are a proposal queue.

If we set the bar at blockchain native AI, that foundation is hard to approach, whilst being completely transparent.

Show a model of STC attribution for island usage.
Set a small tx levy to pay to STC holders.
Show how earnings of dreamcatcher worldwide would pay a small fee to STC holders.
So for simulated earnings, show simulated payout to STC holders.
Experiment with any kind of land levy
Put forwards all plans using these simulations.

Making a spec tool to define the requirements, and distill down some key usage scenarios is key.  The scenario tool should run lots of similar simulations, and determine if the outputs make sense.
Should be able to digest conversations and use that to build out specs, and generate a concise list of questions for the owners to answer / decide upon.
