Absolute effort is very hard to estimate, but relative effort seems easy - this is harder than that, this is much much harder than that.

With a number of comparisons from different people, with strategy on why they thing its hard, we can repeatedly assess things and figure out something closer to true difficulty.

If we concentrate on can a task be broken down any further first, since we want to deliver in modules that reflect a task, beit a patch on a module, or a new module, the work is managed in modules.

Complexity and architecture become the new coding - they become the hard parts.

If the fiddly bits aren't hard since the AI grinds, then we need to identify the other parts that are hard.  AI grind time might become significant enough that it matters too.  AI should be able to estimate this based on prior projects so it can give some data to its answers.

Choosing what paths to grind down becomes the key skill ?
