Automated stuck detection can come after manual stuck detection.

Transclusions can come after direct stateboard.

Chat quotes and replies can come after initial chatting.

Function calling is the most important thing - getting the website to display as a jitter.

Get to the mint - be able to mint tokens for stucks
## Goals
SM working exclusively inside of the Dreamcatcher
Generate NFTs on polygon from inside the Dreamcatcher
Hosted chain with multitenant
Public chain


Once we can mint, and mint from within the Dreamcatcher, then we can start asking for money to progress with stucks.  Lets us rank what they want, expose and hoist what they want, but also start asking for funding in a dedicated way, which will show thruput in the Dreamcatcher.

They can start paying more to get things done faster and to upvote the features they want.
