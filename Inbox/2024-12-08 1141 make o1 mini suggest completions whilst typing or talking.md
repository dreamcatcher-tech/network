Any time we want to type manually,  o1 should be trying to correct thigns and auto complete things.

When speaking, o1 tries to tied things back to context, to give you updated versions as you go along.

Periodically looks at everything as a whole, otherwise just considers small chunks of new inputs.

Builds up a list of topics or easy to mis-type / mis-hear words so it is contextual.
