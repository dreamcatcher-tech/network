Of the public chain, we should take system snapshots so that we can roll back to these points in time if something goes wrong.

We might just take the last fully scrubbed tree ?

So the snapshot doesn't really matter, its just firing up the chain, doing a scrub, and rolling back to some point when things were good maybe ?

If the data was all in NL anyway, does it really matter ?

We would want to walk it to make sure things were of a current format, but wouldn't be required to.
