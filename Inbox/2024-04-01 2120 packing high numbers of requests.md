If there are too many requests to fit in a single atomic tx, then we can make a second tx to batch them together by their keys.

We can batch the batchings and so on, until we can always be assured that we can fit things thru the process regardless.

Or we might set an upper limit, and set the chain thruput to be a certain value.
