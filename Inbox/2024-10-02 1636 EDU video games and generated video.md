Video games using intelligent conversation to progress to the next game. If the gameplay could include intelligence tests or some kind of information exchange, the demonstration of the assimilation of knowledge, some type of a calculation to reinforce a particular type of thinking, then the game could be sort of anything, but playing it for a long time would cause the child's knowledge to expand, not just pure mechanical interaction like a shoot-em-up. If we could get multiplayer that also needed these kinds of intelligences, then these games would be supercharged, so in a way we could use models like Sora, S-O-R-A, to generate video content that was relatable and excitable to the child, as well as requiring a constant dialogue with them to keep the show going, so that they start to learn while watching and we learn what they like to feed them with more things that entice them. This knowledge-based conversation could be included with some sort of a geometry manipulation, like a controller. We could even take these models and make them in control of physical things like little mini-diggers and other such tools, where the bot is constantly teaching them how to improve or do certain tasks in a need-to-do things in a coordinated group to progress to different levels and unlock different powers.
