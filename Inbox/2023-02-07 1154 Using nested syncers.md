Sometimes when fine grained control is required of the syncing mechanism, disposable syncers could be employed.  Specifying fine grained and dynamic control of the syncing is too hard from the top.

So long as they had access to the engine using `useEngine()` or some other context hook, then they could start listening at any point.

This can be used to reduce the load on the engine by disabling some path at the top level, then using dynamic syncers to sync specific paths once we know what those are based on user interaction and application logic.

Since the pulses are the cache, all syncers share the same cache.
