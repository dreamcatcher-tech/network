I want to make a list of stucks that are required to create the CRM app for the trucking guys.
Ask me for more details for whichever ones are missing.

1. making the vercel ui be able to take on standard widgets
2. billing in the ui
3. privy accounts in the ui
4. automate the ability for o1 to generate code without copy paste
5. napps execution environment for a pure filesystem
6. stucks data structure
7. stucks management agent, so we can chat with it about changing the stucks
