Dreamcatcher as a set of software tools, management practices, and professional services that allow apps to be built rapidly, safely, cheaply.

Not just paying for apps by only your usage of only the code you used, but getting paid directly for this usage, at the instant it happens.

Make a complex product with transparent operation, then watch people build on top of it.

As a standalone blockchain, if taken to conclusion as best we can see it now, it might be good enough to be a solution to the general purpose blockchain problem if we're super luck.  However, it is good enough in its current form to better solve the innovation problem.  If it can cause a rate of innovation rate increase (ie: innovation on innovation rate), then that innovation power will improve this model to be the solution to general purpose blockchain.

Internet was made like a phone system with computers plugged in to it, however the ideal model is it acts like a computer, with people and things interacting with the computers.  The survivability has always been about the phone system, with each computing service left to its own devices to survive computation faults in all their forms.

Focusing on DX and BX, where BX is the business experience.

Innovating on innovation.

To pull in those struggling in the commercial world with almost popular software, and to lift up those struggling in the open source world with almost funded software.  By offering a business model to open source that aren't working yet, and commercial ones that don't have a good model, we can increase our ranks.

The only price we ask is fair attribution to all.

To build the dreamcatcher is to use it.

Multiversal applications - applications designed to operate with multiple conflicting views of reality.

Metaverse as shared imagination anchored in a shared reality.

Effort spent building a universal attribution tree is never wasted - when it eventually unfolds, that effort will be rewarded, as surely the builders of the attribution machine will themselves be attributed to.  As a form of meta attribution.  Meta-attribution is our revenue model - a fee for paying out to everyone worthy.

The app is never in an inconsistent state, and can be recovered from any point.  It is always atomic.

If you can make an unstoppable computer, then maintaining a ledger is trivial.

Chaos model of development.

The Joule as a unit of computational energy.  This can be used as a form of intrinsic value peg for a stable currency that is uncensorable but based on real value.

Blockchain gives data redundancy normalization by default.  Consistency is still the designers problem to solve, but because the chains can be shared easily, consistency between organizations is now possible.

Binary layer is by reference, Action layer is by value.

All the worlds attribution in one hash.  Making a universal attribution table for everything in existence, representing as a single hash.

Micropayments dispersals vs token inflation

Inverted Airdrops - drops to everything ever.

Will the problems of the future be solved by the behaviours of today ?
