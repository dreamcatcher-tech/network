Designed to watch the progress of a competitor or project, and score each change they make against some rubric.  Keep updated as their website changes, and accept input from others with rumour submissions, counter factual data, or top level other ways to compare projects.

Eg: set up watchers on Solana.

Track changes over time, so we can forecast rate.

Guess at what the end state of each project is, or as high in the rubric as they are ever likely to go.
