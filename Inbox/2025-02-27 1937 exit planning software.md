If a site was made where the purpose was to make an exit plan, then:

1. When you just start, the hook is to tease you with what a plan can look like and what it can do for you.
2. Once you've committed, the execution of that plan begins.

This software platform will chat with you, it'll help you out a lot, it will give you all kinds of advice and stuff. But it also acts as:
1. a secure repository for your files. 
2. It acts as a marketplace for services that can help you execute on these plans. Some of these services can be provided by AI agents, human agents, or hybrids.
3. And it acts as a marketplace for the business sales themselves. 

So, there are two kinds of people or archetypes that want to use the system:

4. Business owner looking to sell
5. Buyer looking to buy

Both of them are looking at different kinds of appraisal. The seller needs their plan in place, and the buyer needs to see what parts of the plan have not been completed because that's how they can price it in their deals. If we can get the platform used to coordinate multiple services together, the platform is sticky and is not going anywhere. The clients or the end users (business owners, business sellers) would prefer for the operations to go through this system because it means that they can inherit a lot of data as well as they can stay in control of these different services that they may choose to pay. They can switch out if someone doesn't work well and they can have a much more burstable interface to the system so that they can pay on a jobbing basis. Additionally, we can tackle the existing exit planners and see how we've got better software for users. That's free but we'll handle the transaction processing for any new customers that we bring you and that lets us tackle the exit planning software people too.

In this system, our relationship to the large model providers would be that we'd take a base model, augment it with verified knowledge, some coding tools, some vetted search, and allow some expert human assistance on demand. We would then become effectively the dominant base model for anything to do with exit planning.

Interestingly, to occupy some of these roles in the environment requires a lot of background knowledge about the particular business. So apply some documentation and things like that. This model would be very much aware of what docs you need to have or should have in particular or in relation to a various jurisdiction. It would be connected to various registries like companies and land registries 

We could probably sit down and map out what all of the available spaces in the base model space are. There's probably not that many. They are likely region-limited. They will, by their existence, erode the boundaries between regions.

So likely it's simply the use case (e.g., law, exit planning, genomics, fairness, invention, stock valuation, real estate, trade tools). These models would be viewed as a single large agent that would be connected back to a marketplace of services that can enact the will or recommendations of these agents in the real world. 

Also these base agents that set the majority of the utility can then be helped by highly tuned specialized agents that do things which are even more context specific, or involve performing a tasks, or being in connections to other massive foundational models.
