So the template would include mappings - ls would give info about files, and the template tells the AI what each field means, so it doesn't have to guess, nor must we pollute the output with information about what the fields mean.

In traditional UIs, we try to stuff this info into the command itself, but with AI, they don't have any issue with lookup being held out of band.

Means that we could have a fairly standard representation of a file, and can plug different things in to it, like remote servers, and other items.
