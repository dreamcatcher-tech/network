If we just give it a scope, that wouldn't help us select the widget we wanted.

Need to tie this to the page routing, so that with a router present, using hash routing, then we can see the url bar change when the user moves around.

navigate to should be just a scope, and then UI handles how to render that scope ?

to specify a frame, we would need an addressing system for frames ?
then the frame has to be installed, and the user has to be willing to run it ?
could handle that by passing a hint to a frame idendifier, which can be sloppy or can be hash based too ?
