By securing tokens tied to a house, a more pure marketplace for real estate opens up.  The real estate market can now be entered with a very small amount of money, and renters can begin to earn equity in their home.

People can freely trade these tokens, to own some of the capital gains across multiple homes in multiple areas.  Ownership can be liquidated instantly - no refinancing required - no bank account required - put all your money into your home, then sell off equity whenever you need more funds.

Financing can be provided to help you buy tokens.  These tokens can earn an interest rate at market rates, which should be below what the banks charge due to the incredibly reduced overheads.

Lending tokens can be traded amongst people who want the yield locked in by others.  People are free to choose if they want less equity and more interest.

Renting can be handled with automated inspections of houses, a marketplace for inspection and appraisal suppliers.  Owner occupied requires a certain percentage of tokens, else you may need to vacate based on the other owners.  Renters earn equiting in the homes they live in, which incents them to look after the place.

DAO based voting on improvements and renovations cut down the response time for changes.  Marketplace for quotes and contractor management services.

Security cameras double as inspection devices which are periodically switched to open up the feed to the other owners as a means of inspection.
