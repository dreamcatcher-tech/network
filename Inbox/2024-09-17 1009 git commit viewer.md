Can make just unordered list items, and then nest them ?

This could be rendered in markdown too, making it simpler to display ?

How would the diff viewer work ? how to select the files for comparison ?  Need to be able to select multiple files.

If the selection was never wiped by just navigating away, then we could hold multiple files across multiple branches.

Branch explorer would link to the commit graph navigation, and allow rapid branch display.  Branch display would be in a chonky display.

Stack the views for branches, commits, so they can be composed any way we like.
When stacked, exiting out of one takes you up to the next higher dimension.
Or, if they are layed out on the same page, we can click around and see them load up.

Or, an api can be locked to some config and shown next to some other config.

Toggle tracking, in case the tip moves forwards and you want to stay in sync with it.
