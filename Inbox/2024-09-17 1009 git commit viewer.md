Can make just unordered list items, and then nest them ?

This could be rendered in markdown too, making it simpler to display ?

How would the diff viewer work ? how to select the files for comparison ?  Need to be able to select multiple files.

If the selection was never wiped by just navigating away, then we could hold multiple files across multiple branches.
