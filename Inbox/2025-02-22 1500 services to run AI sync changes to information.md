If you change some top level reasoning, you want those changes to ripple out thru everything you do, so we shoudl sell the ability to make these automated workflows.

Eg: commit some code, and it will auto check that the docs are updated, and if not make some reasonable guesses.

Or if you change the docs, it will check against the code, and update the necessary.

Can handle jobs like, if you have some repetition in your codebase, but the complexity of making tooling is too high, then you can use AI to do this manual copying work for you.
