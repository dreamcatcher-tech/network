Schedule a time to trigger some further action using deno cron and timeouts.

So a reminder to do something, which gets written to disk and then a bot branch started with a follow up delay written in somehow.

Ideally want to get these composability tools up to be modifyable using NL chat.

Somehow list out the use cases Smax wants, and show different ways of this working.
These tests run in isolation and with variances, but we can generate an exemplary case, based on the users question, and run it in front of them, step by step, so they see how it works.

Then our docs are able to draw on the use cases we are using to exercise the system.
