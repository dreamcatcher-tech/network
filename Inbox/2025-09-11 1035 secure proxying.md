typically, you have to trust the proxy to faithfully terminate the tls of the remote site.

in coco we can trust that the tls was done right, so in my browser, I can have an extension that guarantees me that the coco was done right, and therefore the remote tls was terminated right.

it can share back the cert chains in the coco, so the extension knows provably that it was talking to the right remote website.

the remote thing could also be another coco.
