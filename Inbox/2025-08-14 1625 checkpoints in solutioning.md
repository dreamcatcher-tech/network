continually stop and see if we think we're better along or worst, and then switch to some other checkpoints where decision points were reached.

So decision points should be hoisted up, and make into things that the user can twiddle with.

The points should be reviewed too, since there might be more options once you know more about a specific path.  Human might want to point at those decision points.
