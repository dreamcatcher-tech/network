If each worker wore glasses that could give them instructions using voice, and maybe a hud.
we see what they see.
we can read barcodes.

so we can scan the barcodes without a laser scanner, we know their location, and their orientation, and we can give them clues as to where a box actually is.

we can have fat ai at the edge that does interpretation of images, and we might change the barcoding to be QR or something.

also have voice where the staff can chat to the main system, and the system can talk to them with instructions on what to do next.

plus can help them with talking about anything else they want, relaying between multiple parties - so long as your performance was maximum, then we don't really care, and in fact we would want to supply you with intelligence to keep your day interesting.

might be cheaper than robots, and certainly more reliable.
