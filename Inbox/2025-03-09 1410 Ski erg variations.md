Ski-Erg is a brutal piece of exercise equipment. 

We should be able to set the points of the Ski-Erg in any location, and the Ski-Erg handles should be able to work independently of one another.

So, you could do the regular Ski-Erg (down crossed with a cable's crossover) or put it on the ground and do an up Ski-Erg where you're lifting both your back and lifting forwards. Bench press Ski-Erg. Basically any angle you can imagine, including lying down on the bench, should be Ski-Ergable. 

And to this, there should be something like the what-bike peanut to allow you to see where the power is coming through during the duration of your stroke. The angle that you're pulling on the cable, the balance between forces between arms. All kinds of stats like that in a nice shape that you can target a kind of an ideal shape to go for. 

The same exercise equipment, you should be able to then combine the handles, and now it has become a rowing machine. You should be able to row vertically, row sitting down, row any direction really. Sort of like a universal cable machine. 

As you come in with your personalized scanning ring or some other kind of ID, we can track your progress with your usage on the machine. We can track the progress between people who are using the machine regularly in a normal way. Using a motor system to provide the resistance, we can provide rapid shock loading so it feels like a rapid-fire machine gun going off, but it's really just causing the peak load on your muscle fibers to be significantly higher than your peak mode in regular 

The idea of this extra stimulation is to promote the growth of muscle. By comparing the data between people using the machine in this vibrating mode and normal mode, and seeing the growth, we should be able to estimate the effectiveness of the shock loading during the training sessions. it's like vibratrain.
