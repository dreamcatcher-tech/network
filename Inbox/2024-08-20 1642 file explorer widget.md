This could be wrapped in a git navigator to lock to a specific commit, or a specific branch.
Filesystem stays open at its affinity path, but then if not present, stays open but shows that there is nothing matching.

So can browse the filesystem, the branch tree, and the commit history, and see how things changed.

File explorer can look at a specific file as well.

May allow you to jump in to an editor in this view ?
Or just use the selection to indicate that you want to do something about it.

Bot can clear the selection or modify it at any time.
