If we do nothing else, we can at least collect evidence that indicates the potential for a case to occur.  Then we can also receive funding from those who would benefit from the case progressing.

Search for other cases that are similar, so can fund commonalities between them.

If we can transform two cases into mainly one case, this is halving the price of each.
