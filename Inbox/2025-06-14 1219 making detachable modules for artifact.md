Detach something like the mic service, so we can provide a little tool that handles all your transcriptions for you, works across multiple devices, can trigger pipelines.

means we can connect in different pieces of data.

ultimately sensors on products would follow this model.

but it means we can avoid all these little point solution apps, and we start instead building just sensor connectors and little mini uis.

the sensor being connected to a broader system means that the solutions are far more general, adaptable, and customizable.
