The blockproducers, who charge for blocks produced and transmitted, could also run speedtests.

Speedtests can be provided continually, rather than a dedicated test.  Any snippet of any fetching can be used as a speedtest since the payment receipt for the service also includes latency of the pulses that were transmitted and sizes.

To make something a speed test, only need to request guaranteed blocks, rather than having the block producer go fetch.  

Tests can control the parameters of the test by setting what blocks they want to fetch.
We can use common blocks that all producers are guaranteed to have locally.

Multihop tests, where we pull thru other producers to get link speed.

Remote speed tests where we test between two block producers on behalf of someone else.

Results are guaranteed since they are paid for.

Speedtests can be used for moving large amounts of data cheaply.  Queue up info that we want moved, to subsidize the speedtest, then the speedtest becomes cheaper than moving pure data.
