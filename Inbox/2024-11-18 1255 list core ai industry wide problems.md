If the things you are talking about hit this list we can say why it is a hard problem, and reduce your problem down to this standard, well reasoned about form.

Stake against these problems to assure the correctness, which means you get paid a small amount each time it gets relied upon.

Any statement should be able to be staked against, so that if you get proven wrong, you lose that stake.  This makes people trust what you say more.
