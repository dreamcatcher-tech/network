like if you have a wine growing agent, that specializes in wine growing in a particular region, that could represent the knowledge of a small group of expert farmers, then every other agent should be able to ask questions of this agent, treating them like an oracle.

And so they wouldn't integrate in directly, but rather, the accounting agent might occasionally ask some question of this agent to get an opinion on what to buy, or why we're spending money a certain way.

So its like an expert that is always available.
