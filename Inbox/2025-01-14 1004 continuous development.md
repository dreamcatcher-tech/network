Picture a **reasoning workbench** where you continuously talk through your coding process—creating new interfaces, jotting down ad hoc ideas, or noting documentation needs on the fly. As you speak, **background tasks** spin up _speculatively_ in response to each spoken hint, each potential adjustment, and each reflection you vocalize. Multiple **code change options** might appear for you to review in real time, and you can verbally discuss them—accepting, rejecting, or modifying ideas on the spot.

Here’s how it could look:

1. **Streaming Speech Recognition**
    
    - Low-latency transcription (e.g. Vosk, Whisper) captures every detail of your spoken process, including spontaneous remarks on interfaces you just created.
    - Any natural-language command or offhand comment feeds the system continuously.
2. **Task Orchestration**
    
    - Your orchestrator dispatches these transcribed snippets to “agents” specialized in refactoring, documentation, interface design, or even experimental tasks that proactively try out code changes.
    - The workbench always shows which speculative tasks are running, letting you watch the system “think out loud” in the background.
3. **Agent Execution**
    
    - Each agent works on ephemeral branches, producing diffs or patch sets for your interface or other code.
    - If you casually mention “I might need better docs for that method,” a doc generator agent jumps in to propose docstrings or inline explanation.
    - Meanwhile, a refactoring agent might run parallel experiments, especially if you mentioned wanting to tweak the interface structure.
4. **Real-Time Discussion and Selection**
    
    - Proposed code changes pop into a side panel in your **reasoning workbench**. You see multiple suggestions and can verbally compare them.
    - In a running commentary, you can clarify your needs: “Actually, that second diff looks closer to what I want—can we reorder those methods?”
    - The system captures this feedback, refining its proposals or spinning up new agents.
5. **Conversational Flow**
    
    - The entire coding session becomes more ad hoc and conversational. Instead of pausing to formally invoke a command, you just speak your thoughts.
    - Your continuous commentary drives background tasks to adapt: they speculate on likely next steps, so when you do need them, they’re ready.
6. **Adaptive Context and Version Control**
    
    - Agents track changes in real time, committing them to version control in separate branches or saving them for reference.
    - As you accept or reject certain proposals, the system learns your style and context, becoming more aligned with how you code.

Overall, this **reasoning workbench** approach fosters a fluid, real-time interplay between your spoken reflections and a suite of AI-driven helpers. Instead of rigid commands, you get an ongoing, open conversation—your speech shapes the speculative tasks, and their results, in turn, shape your coding.

Once we get that working with team mates, we can all be working on different sections, and can see when someone else is working on something, and can listen in, or talk to them directly.  Like a google docs style thing, but you're either muted (same as if you're both typing on the keyboard) or collarobative, where you're talking to each other and the bots are grinding.

Snapshots get taken so that when the speech is made, the exact context is available to the bot so it knows what you could see at the time.  If it also had your gaze info, that would help it a lot too.

And further, as I progress my way down through the file, I would go line by line and my comments would be reflective of what the cursor was on at that point, and then below the file, the bot should be regenerating the code so that it matches what I'm saying as I go down line by line, so more important things need to come at the top, like functions that would define how everything else works, and so as my comments go in, as I review it from top to bottom, the bot begins trying to fill in the blanks underneath.
