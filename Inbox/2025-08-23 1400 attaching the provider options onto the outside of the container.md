something has to be used to carry external instructions, without a target / scoped repo location, so that anything at all occurs.

this is the thing that makes sure that all the things have a target scope.

then inside, there would be a class of actions that have access to the system scope, which grants access to the db.

a user level action that calls system functions would transmit those using actions, so that it can cross the isolation membrane.

we might as well use the same function message calling code, but do not think it is the same, it is just reusing something convenient.j
