Be able to change what a company purpose is very rapidly.  For the Dreamcatcher, we want to often rearrange the pieces based on how we want to present ourselves, and so we want to rapidly regenerate a website to explain what we do, pitch decks, blog posts.

Reprioritize what the company does, then auto regenerate all the published material about the company.

Make a tree that starts with top level purpose, then lets user work their way down the tree, making edits and rankings that affect what gets generated lower down.
