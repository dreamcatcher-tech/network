We have these items:

- helps - has a default format
- isolates - has a default api / functions method. functions called by help runners
- runners - has a default function that gets called with parameters
- artifact - the running thing that stitches the helps and the isolates together

Possible additions:
- stucks ? 
- goals - might make a list of things the system wants to do


We will build these primitives manually, and then use AI enhanced NL programming to ratify them and extend them out further.

To run the help is to call the runner as an isolate function with the parameters the runner expects.
