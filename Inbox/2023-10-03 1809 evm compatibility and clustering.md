We could let people deploy evm code to our chains to be run publicly pretty easily.
We can increase the thruput if we designate clustering, which is a set of addresses that each contract will depend upon.

Groups of clusters can run in parallel, and where their interfaces touch, we can synchronize.

This can make them run very much faster.
