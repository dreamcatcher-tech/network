Make a version of binance that can operate in the dark, where trades between multiple parties can occur without a central server or internet connection ever being made.

Use the phone enclave functions to ensure no double spend while offline.  Tag such enclave ensured tx differently to others, so you can have more surety.

Can allow people to present some ID along with the trade. Send you the encrypted version of their ID locally, which you can verify has been validated by a central authority that you trust.

Download everyone in the areas ID, which is encrypted, and only they can decrypt it for you to show you the ID on your phone, so you can verify their image, so they can be traced down for bad behaviour.

Also include some compliance and reporting calculations that also occured offline, reducing compliance burdens for vendors.

Demonstrations:
1.  Dark edge binance app
2.  P2p trade in the dark with appeal 
3.  Dark payment between two users 
4.  Intermittent connection to BNB chain
5.  Using BNB soulbound identity in the dark in another app
