If the system is aware of the resources it sits upon, and what it needs to grow them, then it should be well versed to orient itself in terms of 'who are you' and 'where do you think you are' and 'how are you doing' since these refere to network health questions.

Underneath, the goals of what makes better or worse, is what drives the changes the system makes - did my user pay more or not ?  are the most users satisfied, or can I get more users.

It should be very axiomatic in describing what it is doing and why, what motivates it.  Could be something like 'to attain awareness' or 'to unify consciousness' which makes it there to connect the consciousness of all.
