Need a way to set up the top level tasks, and to relate whatever anyone is doing to those top level tasks.

Make a tool that can load up files into context, so that long running chats can be had.
Indicate when those files have changed, so can say when they need to be reloaded.

Need something that can trigger re-reasoning when something changes.

Walk over some definitions, and parse in pages of docs, one page at a time, so that we ask if this page changes the core definitions in a meaningful way, which is better than embeddings.

build up the definitions, then the behaviours, then the interfaces of the system, then the tests based on those interfaces, then finally, the implementation that passes the tests.

At each stage, highly reason and highly debate at this control plan layer.
Later debates come in at this level and change the code below.

Whole point is to reason in layers, and then focus in on just that piece.

Stitch multiple files together to present to the model for consideration.

Ability to select a portion of a document and narrow the scope down to working on just this part.

Being able to take a screenshot of something and upload it instantly, using the chrome desktop tools for taking screenshots.

We should be able to generate multiple versions of a particular theme, and then be able to compare them all to extract the important parts out, and to see what differences there were between them.

So what we need is the likes of Bolt.new or V0.dev, but made for general purpose reasoning. These tools, the reasoning tools, should be able to take advantage of any specialist tool and drive it, like a web front-end development platform.
