Each time I do some research or converse with a bot, what I would expect is that in the background another agent is working to reconcile against all my other knowledge. While I'm searching, this same agent is reasoning based on my prior knowledge base to try and give insights and thoughts. These should be popping up at the side as they stream in and be re-ranked constantly in importance with visual feedback on the thresholds that each one is reaching.

Because this is a dynamic change in the UI, the human should be able to step back through it at each point and see where it was.
