if we had an mcp server that could publish to jsr, and knew about how to make that work ?
so it could run the actual publish command on the server side ?

we could allow the server to run with overridden descriptions of tools, if someone wants to play with changing the prompting around the tools.

then we can allow running with altered code files or message signatures, by pulling down the repo and making the changes in there ?
Or by downloading the jsr package, and modifying those ?

Have a dedicated agent that gets passed a mock thing that works, and its job is to reduce that down to the minimal patch, submit it, then notify the caller.
This again follows the principle or reducing the load on the caller, so they don't have to figure out all these things.

We have high level universal agents, then we have teams of specialists, where the specialists are the platform selling point, and include people, and are there to provide very good functions that fulfill intent in well evaluated, reliable, fast, cheap, high quality ways.

So you can have whatever universal agent suits your needs, but the quality of the output is high due to these specialists.
