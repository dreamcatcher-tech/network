This seems the key for nApps.

If it was a structured output, this is really just an api call.

an NL call is something different plain text in, plain text out.

nApps are the way we bridge between the software world and the inference world.
nApps are how AI is connected to the rest of the world.

Need to call it with background options, so all nAapp calls have a specific format.
