If we could make a modular game system, then in VR we should be able to pull in widgets that were made off-game and imported, and just viewed in the game environment, which would become like a browser. The widgets would have standards for how they can be presented, what things they can do with graphics, and they may be watched by a visual AI that looks for glitches or bad behavior. If they were made to match physics, then this is even easier since they can limit the surprising things they can do (e.g., suddenly occupy the maximum allowed volume and other types of rules).

We can implement change restrictions on them. In this way, in an environment with your friends, you can pull in widgets that you made, had made, or purchased. Talk about ones that you asked to be made. Discuss differences in the objects. The objects should be optionally allowed to listen to what you're saying about them so that they can be improved. 

The objects can be connected to external information sources and computation. So you could, for example, make a computer screen that was made to be a physical computer that had program controls in it that you could adjust on the fly.
