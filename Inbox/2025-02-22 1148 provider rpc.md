Its almost like the provider interface needs to be action typed, using zod ?

If the provider functions were all action capable, the the provider implementation could be derived from these types.

Then whenever the provider functions are called, we can quickly do a type check.

The provider could be defined as a napp.json ?

The the provider instance is like a thing that inverts the action creation part ?

? how to nest the action calls tho, since the provider is well nested ?  Segment by napp ?

Then we need to intercept some action calls and do some caching on the local browser, or the deno isolate.
