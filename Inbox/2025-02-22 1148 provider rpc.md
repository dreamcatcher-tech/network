Its almost like the provider interface needs to be action typed, using zod ?

If the provider functions were all action capable, the the provider implementation could be derived from these types.

Then whenever the provider functions are called, we can quickly do a type check.

The provider could be defined as a napp.json ?

The the provider instance is like a thing that inverts the action creation part ?

? how to nest the action calls tho, since the provider is well nested ?  Segment by napp ?

Then we need to intercept some action calls and do some caching on the local browser, or the deno isolate.

Could flatten the provider interface, so it is a single set of napp calls.

The ability to call the function should be removed from the provider instance, and become part of the context instance.

By making the artifact RPC have the same format as what its internal napp api expects, we could theoretically run it inside of itself, since it doesn't care at all  about whats on the other side responding to those actions.

The problem of transforming function calls and returns into actions is the same.
