poe.com provides an aggregator of all popular bots.  We could do the same, but provide programmatic access, and possibly public and verified access.

We can mint an NFT for every prompt you send.  We can allow the system to wait for the mint before the submit, or do both in parallel for the best response time.

Allow your training data to be used between all the different bots using transformations.

Verify using the https responses of the api calls, so that later verification can know that the certs were valid and the outcome did indeed come from the API in question.
