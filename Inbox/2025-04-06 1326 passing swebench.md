We would need to be able to present our scores on this task, and to watch it go up.

If we can thens how how we improved in this benchmark thanks to contributions of all, then this proves the dreamcatcher.

We should have the highest score, be the first to improve when new models come out, and be the first to place improving trends on benchmarks.

Ours should be the fastest growth rate - any new bench, we should be fastest to grow.
