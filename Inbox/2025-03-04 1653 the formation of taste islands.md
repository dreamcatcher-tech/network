When models are being shaped by humans or through usage, what we should start to see are islands of preference that are exclusive of each other. Typically, a company will pick one island and push that strongly, but we should allow a system that can have multiple islands that recognize their differences, which allows us to serve a greater number of users because we can find which island they belong to more quickly.

The islands can be part of the backing data structure of the model, such that when you talk, you talk to all islands and we quickly identify which island you belong to.
