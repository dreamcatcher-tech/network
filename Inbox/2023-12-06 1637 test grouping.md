Every goal the users make should be stored on our servers for us to go thru.

We can then group them together as similar tasks, and start to emulate the user on the system doing the same task so we can improve our scores in these areas.

This should make a system that has vast amounts of testing happening, and so the quality is increasing rapidly, either each task a user tries to do.

So we are focusing less on code correctness, and more on the jobs-to-be-done that the customer have - rating the efficacy of the tool.  This means we are delivering on things the customer wanted.

Now, a new feature is the customer just trying to do it, rather than them having to wonder about it, or talk to us about it.
