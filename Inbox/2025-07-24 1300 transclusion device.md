have a popup that gives brief info, but then when you click edit it pops up a modal with more surface area.

might pop up a stateboard ? maybe not, so it stays as feeling like something outside of the chat.

currently the files all list in the chat as a big lump.
clicking on one opens it in the stateboard.

we want to be able to pass more items into this list.

how it looks in the final state should be the same as how it looks when you're picking it.
the device should be a stateboard item, so you click it and it expands out, which gives you a file browser, as well as specialized viewers 

the transcludes table, where the transclusions are created.
