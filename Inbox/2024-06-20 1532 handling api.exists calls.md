When the API is remote, exists needs to be locked to something.

So api should be locked to the head commit ?

const api = await IsolateApi.connect(pid)

This will open it at the head at this particular instant.  An action to system would have been dispatched, and the result comes back with a commit.

The latest version can be refreshed by calling the connect function again.
