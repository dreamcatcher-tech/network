**High-Level Concept**

1. **Hardware Setup**
    
    - A dedicated push-to-talk button integrated with a “privacy mask” containing a built-in mic.
    - When pressed, the hardware sends a signal (e.g. via USB HID or Bluetooth) to the local machine, indicating that the audio path should switch from “Meeting” to “Bot/Agent.”
    - On release, audio goes back to the main meeting mic channel.
2. **Software Routing**
    
    - Implement a virtual audio device driver on the local machine (e.g. using Loopback on macOS, VB-Audio on Windows, or custom ALSA loopback on Linux).
    - The meeting software is set to receive from the virtual device.
    - A local daemon (written in TS with native extensions if needed) routes real mic data into either:
        - The virtual device (to pass into the meeting)
        - A separate channel that gets processed or uploaded to the bot/agent.
    - The daemon listens for the hardware button event to toggle these routes.
3. **Privacy Mask Mechanics**
    
    - The mask physically dampens sound leakage, preventing meeting participants from hearing your side conversation.
    - Pushing and holding the button overrides mic routing, so meeting participants get silence while the bot hears the audio.
4. **Bot Interaction**
    
    - If the device is pressed, the daemon streams audio to the bot (local or cloud STT).
    - The bot processes the audio and responds, possibly via text or a local TTS channel (played back through a different output device, e.g. headphones).
5. **Advantages**
    
    - Ensures meeting privacy without manually toggling settings in software.
    - Minimal leakage thanks to the mask and hardware gating.
    - Allows seamless hands-on control with physical feedback from the button.

This approach uses simple hardware signaling plus OS-level virtual audio routing, so you can easily divert or resume audio flow.
