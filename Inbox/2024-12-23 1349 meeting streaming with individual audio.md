Take each audio stream, and send it in to deepgram for transcription.

Then keep piping all the timestamped audio into o1 for processing.  It will define a cursor, where it knows a particular topic ended, so it is constantly bundling up topics, and detecting topic switch.

Show these questions and points live, during the talk, so we know what's going on.

Generate questions beforehand, and tick those off the list as they get answered.
