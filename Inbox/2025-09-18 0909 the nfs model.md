if each machine was unique only for its image, and we always have some on standby, so when called on, we just deploy the agent.toml to it.

so then a machine is assigned a dns name purely dynamically.

nfs needs to be shared between all users, else it becomes inefficient.
so we boot up the root app, which should hold the NFS server, and does the auth, and uses flycast to point traffic in to each individual user app.

so it does auth for the browser requests, but also auth for the users apps that want to talk to other apps ? sends a replay or something ?
So the only way that machines communicate with other machines, is using this service.
it also has a whoami service.

renaming an agent tears down all running connections and issues a redirect ? 
or, it keeps the existing things running, so you can stay pointed ?

agent booting has access to a particular workspace, which is based of of a git repo.
the git repo is stored separately, and the folder is checked out as a workspace folder.

agent space is the fiber tree.

so its a special part of the NFS store that is used for managing agents.
