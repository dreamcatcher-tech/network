Could the bot appraise its own performance and decide to have another go at making things better too ?

If the realtime bot was processing the conversation, and was saying that someone had started to repeat themselves and starting sounding warning bells, then this would help the meeting move forwards without anyones feelings getting hurt.  If we all agree we're here for max rate forwards, then we all agree to be issued improvements by the bot.
