Be able to dump a large number of arbitrary docs into a bot, and work on extracting a particular output, like a curated list of options for a proposal.  Learnings from the discussion are stored in another set of pooled facts which can be drawn upon later.

The specific docs plus the pool is what comes together to produce the output.
