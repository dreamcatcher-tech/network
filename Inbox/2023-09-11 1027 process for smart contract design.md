Sketch out a statechart.
Work with stakeholders to ensure all user stories can be mapped out using this chart.
Select some paths as key indicator paths that we will focus on building, in the context of the overall statechart.
Connect the app up to the statechart.
Do exhaustive path testing on the statechart.

Deploy.

Model all user actions as flows in a statechart, and ensure that we are covering them all - most can be condensed down as a reptition of some simpler flows.  

If all possible user actions are contributing to the statechart, then we can know we have exhaustively tested the total system.
