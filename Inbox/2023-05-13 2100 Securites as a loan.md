If we make a pool of funds where we use those funds to build packets, but we treat their money as loaned to us, then we pay them back some interest rate where that rate was reflected by how much return we were getting from the ambient attribution, then could the funds not be considered a security ?

Idea is for people to place their money in a pool if they do not want to perform any of the managerial work required to manage the Packets.
