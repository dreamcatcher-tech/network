It shouldn't be me that has to name the snippets of the notes that I take in the Inventor's Notebook. I should be able to just pick up the button, indicate that I'm taking a note, and then have it automatically name a file and refine it whilst keeping the original text in tact for reference, as well as possibly the original audio being stored in the Blob library.
