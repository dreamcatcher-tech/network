I will be able to digest a book, particularly one with rules, like the Clean Code book, and then be able to run through all the code that is given to assess it against these rules and make the necessary changes to it. In this way we can take a book of knowledge, modify the book to suit our own purposes when necessary in an ongoing basis, as well as apply all the knowledge of that book against code.

We could scrape large numbers of books and extract all the info we need from them.
