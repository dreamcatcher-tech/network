click on special button and will open the transcludes frame to analyze it more deeply.
clicking on a selection item will open that frame with the current selection items.
x on a selection will remove from selection
x on a frame will remote that frames selections.

How to pass ephemeral data around between napps ?
maybe with the index section, like the files that haven't been committed yet ?

? what if the same file path is selected using multiple frames ?
this would be deduplicated, and so only one goes in the context ?  Or just send both in ?

x on the transclude itself resets it.

transclude frame shows the raw text that goes in there.
