Be able to share screens with anyone on the team instantly.

Everyone working on shared screens, anyone can see what anyone is doing or what they were doing.

We can achieve this using just browser tabs, and then show it as a large number of screens in a virtual world.

If we work on just providing browsers, then this can avoid having a full blown computer.

Eye tracking so it knows what you're looking at.
