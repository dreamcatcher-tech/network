We should be able to rapidly go with half a dozen strategies, and the bot should know how to switch strategies if it isn't getting anywhere with a given approach.

The strategies need to be in plain text almost.

They should be nestable.

We should be the place where people come when they want to test out a new theory, since we can offer no code ways to test things out and eval them, tweak and tune them, without having to code.

Because they are in NL, the bots can help to suggest things for them.
