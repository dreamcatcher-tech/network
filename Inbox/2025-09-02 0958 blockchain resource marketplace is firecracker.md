we would be selling firecracker vm resources.
availability, start times, calculations.

insteado f one host providing all the firecracker instances, it is a continually switching marketplace.

so to sell into the marketplace, you need to provide firecracker resource.

it has to be like this since if we want to offer general computation, it has to be contained.
the smallest way to contain general compute is firecracker.
it is also very fast, so it can act like a FaaS.
