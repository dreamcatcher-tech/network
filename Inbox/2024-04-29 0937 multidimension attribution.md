If we find new dimensions later, we should be able to recalculate those, and back calculate.

We provide the anchor point, where people can add different dimensions and multiple competing views of what the amounts and dimensions were, but at least they anchor around the same event ID.

Means that total attribution can be calculated depending on what views you hold.
People can know what your views are before they engage with you.

So the key is that our attribution calculations are not exclusive of others - we offer one view, and the substrate that supports accessing that data, and allows debates with the core logic that can upgrade them.

Even other viewers of our data can be constructed, for relying on our logic, but seeing it a different way.

charged / costs is a separate dimension that measured what the project cost to consume.

Contributor cost could be another dimension.

blocking - what this project stopped from happening ?

losses due to inferiority - what flaws or deficiencies have cost its consumers ?

Innovation unlock - what things were enabled because of this ?

Revenue enabled - how much did this project allow other projects to have significant impact ?

Presence - did someone keep the flame burning at a location

Communication - were comms enhanced ?

Carrying capacity of the biosphere ?

energy, food, water, shelter - were these things increased or decreased.

Some of these are dimensions we want, and others are pure impact regardless of anything else - absolutes.
