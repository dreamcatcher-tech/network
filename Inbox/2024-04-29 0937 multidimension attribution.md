If we find new dimensions later, we should be able to recalculate those, and back calculate.

We provide the anchor point, where people can add different dimensions and multiple competing views of what the amounts and dimensions were, but at least they anchor around the same event ID.

Means that total attribution can be calculated depending on what views you hold.
People can know what your views are before they engage with you.

So the key is that our attribution calculations are not exclusive of others - we offer one view, and the substrate that supports accessing that data, and allows debates with the core logic that can upgrade them.

Even other viewers of our data can be constructed, for relying on our logic, but seeing it a different way.
