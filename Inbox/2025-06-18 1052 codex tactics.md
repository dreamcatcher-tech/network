the key is the rate of pull requests, provided they are all of good value.

so always push on when processing a diff would result in a merge.

send out tasks even if you know there will be conflicts, and then rerun the tasks rather than fussing with merges.

periodically, go thru each module in the codebase by hand, and hand pick and hand test, to make sure it all holds together at the top.
