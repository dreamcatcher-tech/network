the key is the rate of pull requests, provided they are all of good value.

so always push on when processing a diff would result in a merge.

send out tasks even if you know there will be conflicts, and then rerun the tasks rather than fussing with merges.

periodically, go thru each module in the codebase by hand, and hand pick and hand test, to make sure it all holds together at the top.

Just knowing what the prompt descended to codecs can be half the job, so it always makes sense to work away on those and have them lined up in a queue ready to go. These in a way represent one part of the decision tree of programming, the other part will be the response from the model as it tries to act wishes. This tree planned or desired tree and it is the reality tree reconciling these things is the program's job or art.
