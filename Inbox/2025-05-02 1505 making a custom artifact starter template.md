We could let people make little demos where they log in as themselves and can then have their own Artifact repo and own controls over it. They can then open up the Safe default page that we publish and they can delete any repos that they don't have or want to get rid of that they were playing with. Within their default set up, they could click an Edit in Stack Blitz option and it would fire up a starter project that was provisioned to point at some particular repo that they had chosen. It could include their actor repo as well. It can have the ability to make new repos. 

So then we can hand these tools off to other people to try and prove or express the things that they want to make within it. 

How do we allow for the running of arbitrary server-side code in the system? 

Start by making your own applications run where you have trust and control of the system. Then you would allow them to supply packaged code or run code that gets loaded from the file system during runtime in a sandbox. 

In our standard viewer, we would provide buttons against each of your repos that would allow you to fire up a UI against it. If you want to make a more generic UI, then you'll need to use that particular starter which we'll reference separately. 

The pitch from us is that if you move the server keys or move the repo with a prominence chain intact, then you can start running that on any infrastructure that you provide. So you can pull it down to your own computer, move it to a competing hosting provider, leave it with us, run it across several anything like that.

The whole point is that the applications you produce and the data that they rely upon are portable to any way you like and modular, and that they can be split apart and treated as components. So you can publish different kinds of executable code that are themselves their own package as it were, which is able to be consumed in no matter what environment the hosting provider gives you.
