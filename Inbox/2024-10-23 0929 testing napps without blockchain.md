A very lightweight version could be set up, without account management and all the other issues,

This would provide a mock api, and could allow control of the time and other aspects.

Might be faster to just use actual artifact for this ?

In test mode, the napps could be loaded from the fs, rather than from the published versions, which is what the deploy version would load.
