Use a wrapping service, and then allow an algorithmic lockup to be performed.

So a stock can be smoothed using a DEX.  This DEX can allow anyone to put their stock in it, and do things with it, like ensure it is taken off the table.

The formula by which the stock is traded can also be published and be done on chain.  Someone has to pay the gas for invocation of the formula as required, but it can trigger big orders in its favour.  The service provided offers publishing a certified ticker, which can come from a group of publishers, which the DEX uses to trigger.  To execute the DEX, you have to pay the gas to call the ticker.

To trade the stock you have to pass KYC - your account has to be soulbound.

Means that we could be selling and buying founders stock without the suspicions assosciated, since we're stabilizing the price.  Everyone else trading would know the stability of this system.
