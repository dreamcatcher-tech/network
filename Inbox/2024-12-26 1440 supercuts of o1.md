I think another good use of the supercut algorithm, sorry, method, is to let us have conversations with O1Pro and all the thinking time that goes into it is removed and so the consumer or the watcher simply sees intelligent questions very intelligent responses and then as a result O1Pro can also sort of explore what these other questions might be so that when the next round of questions from the human is chosen they are very considered and innovative as well.

By filtering out idle segments (thinking time) and stitching Q&A sequences together, a supercut approach yields a concise conversational flow with O1Pro. The method can then index conversation nodes (questions, responses), cross-reference them for context, and generate “next round” prompts that build on previous answers. The result is a more streamlined experience for viewers and better-grounded future inquiries.

We can then publish these videos, and can handle a diverse range of subjects, and invite guest speakers, and push the knowledge frontier forwards.
