Could it be that the request toggled, in that it was something, become something else, toggled back and that triggered an exe ?

But exe should never trigger unless it can be actually executed upon ?

So if there is a whole bunch of requests, then some are pending accumulation, 

The error is definitely a genuine raw request is firing off TWICE.
Twice kills it, since buffer is not the same.

Another test is the origin action is the same, but there is nothing further to do.
So if there is something in the exe cache, then you MUST have something in the accumulator.

How to know when an exe has been triggered ?
How to ensure that it only fires exactly ONCE ?


How can we force this error to occur ?

Under what circumastances can this happen /
