We could strip our core right down and lean on audits of SES, the trusted computing base, and strip down isomorphic git.

These audits could then certify our plumbing, and so long as the LLM we engaged was operating correctly, then our system is trusted.

Probably the oracle db isn't audited, so we'd be doing pretty good.
