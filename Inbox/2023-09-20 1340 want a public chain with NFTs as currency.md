Have no token, but rather have a set of NFTs that get paid royalties on the transactions of value that occur on the system.

The public chain sells compute resources publicly and privately, including LLM execution.  We make the chain be a cloud provider equivalent.  Build on the fact that turning workloads to be local is generally cheaper than cloud.  Also people with private GPU always have spare capacity, so we can rent that off them.

Each request can be modelled as an NFT too.
