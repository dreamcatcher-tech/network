hardcode the actor.
hardcode the repo, which has been created beforehand.


could match the bearerAuth to the repo ?
allowed users should be a section in the config.


need to block actions from some actors? like the crm actors cannot create new repos, and cannot make new actors, cannot delete any actors or repos either.

Make a separate UI that is purely a file browser / git browser.

Then use this to do admin level commands.
