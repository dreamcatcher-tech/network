since we can run arbitrary programs reliably, we could do the user rollout upgrades using agents, rather than using coding.

each user rollout would be handled specifically, as we focus on them to make sure everything is working.

would be less coding, better customization, better direct fixes since we pay attention to that specific user rather than using these shared things.
