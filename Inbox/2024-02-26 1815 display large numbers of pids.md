Be able to see manys pans in new relic as huge parallel processes trip off.

Show as an explorer tree with infinite scroll in the webui, so parent and child branches trickle in, and disappear when closed.

The tree would prepresent the current snapshot, and we could walk backwards to see any other point in time.

Server side it would just walk the io channels of all the child branches, filling in the ui with more as it found them.

The explorer tree shows the tip of all the branches and their relationship to each other.
