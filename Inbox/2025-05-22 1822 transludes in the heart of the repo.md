>[!danger] Depends: 

should they be actually in the soul branch ?
are they part of the network comms ?
can a regular branch talk externally only by going thru the soul branch ?

should they be separate per branch ?

or are they global per repo ?
if they were stored in soul, then they could be referenced simply from anywhere.
soul could store them in a merkle tree, and they could be shared without fear ?
they would have a simple number ?
