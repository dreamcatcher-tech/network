Make a system that can describe how we expect the stuck loop to function, with stuck generation and funding.

Set some dials in the simulator where a certain percentage of types of actions are taken.

Make action classifiers, where we try put actions into buckets, to be controlled as a group of similarity.

Should be able to show the stuck loop actually operating in the simulation.
