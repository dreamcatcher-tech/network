If we line up a collection of classic sayings about startups, such as "break up early, done number long, cut deep" - all those kinds of classic wisdom that are not obvious at first or that are painful to see and so we avoid looking at them - if we do that, then the bot can start to surface these classic, simple things. By looking at the state of the company, or even just conversing with you. They can tell anecdotal stories about other popular startups. So that you can draw some inspiration. These can even help you convince other people. Also can pull in some stats to back up things, you know like learning when it's time to quit. When to spend your time chasing a particular customer. All those kinds of things that could be like an adornment strategy that runs kind of inside like in your notification bar type of thing.
