should the target scope just be a transclude, rather than a scope ?

the selected transclude can include arbitrary information, like what napp to display / what napp is being displayed / which frame can interpret this transclude for you.

translcudes could include the napp that was used to display them, so that anyone readin gthe translcude can have a hint as to what frame to load up to view it with.
