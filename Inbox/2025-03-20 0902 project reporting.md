Based on Git commits, we could even fine-tune how to recognize what areas of a project a person was working on by identifying the changes to particular folders that are minor, benign, or the result of automated tools such as renamers. 

Then we can account for rather accurately down to the day what was being worked on in any particular area. We might additionally correlate this with clock-in clock-out times to get a more accurate read on how many hours was being spent on how many hours in each area. 

Finally, we should match this with the plan. What a bot thinks you're gonna do next, what you said you're gonna do next, what you communicated to the other stakeholders you're gonna do next, how the progress is currently going. And it could ask you proactive questions like "you're supposed to be working on this particular bit but your not, that's fine. What are you doing? What's your goal? What's the hold up? What are the issues?" 

Then it just makes for a very smooth project management experience where we keep everyone updated. 

We should be able to debate with the bot what the plan is so the architectural overview should be constantly making sense to the bot and being argued about. It should also be doing background research and then telling you when a particular path may or may not be in your best interest Asking a range of different questions and using architectural strategies to figure out if best practices are being adhered to and also whether the design will meet with its final goal plus other stakeholders can give feedback on this planning and the resulting outcome of the project as well without necessarily bothering anyone directly just talking to the bot and expressing their concerns.
