this could be done with params in the url, or give you your own subdomain, or point real domains in.

let users store these things in a given repo, then dns link to the repo and a specific branch, and have it be preconfigured with napps.

This is in iteself a napp maybe ?

makes for much nicer urls if they name it to represent scope and jumble of napps with different settings.

So this is a scope / napp combo.
A sliver of overlay config.

sharing a scope that has napps configured is even easier, just share the dns name.
