When backchat starts a new thread, it might often put in some initial prompt to get things started.

If it does, then it needs to call run, rather than just start and let the thing sit there ?

Or, should we always call run, so the bot gets a chance to start saying something ?

The summarizer of the threads can also be generating memory palace pictures so the user can remember things.

Also can have a memory palace of the day, or all the threads combined ?

Can do this for customer records where a photo shows key things that we might want to see at a glance, like history, latest calls, current pickup schedule.

Might have a little name for the agent made up on the fly.
A one liner sentence summary can also be used.
