Need a protocol to determine how names can be mapped to public keys and other resources.

Also need a way to handle strong relative lookups, based on connections to friends, or context.

This social lookup service can pay a small amount to all participants, but also helps fight spam and deceit since whatever all your friends use is what you will use, without any prior experience with the thing.

You and your friends would also pull down copies of what you looked at last and share them amongst yourselves.
