Set up opposing teams, and each tries to prompt bots and models in an open world game to defeat each other, like border control vs human.

People are effectively racing bots against each other, and the game platform is skimming the token burn and in game items purchase.

the bots see it like call of duty, and then they get let out in the real world.

simulating real world games, with hacks and htings, start in a dojo where it's all simulated, then see it happen in the real world.
