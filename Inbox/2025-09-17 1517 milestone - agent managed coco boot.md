we should be able to deploy a codex agent on a box, and also pass off measurements of its state / wipe the box repeatedly, as the system learns, records its learnings, and ultimately produces a coco vm that is attestable, so we can, remotely, release keys to it.

The project would seek to develop the smallest amount of software required to connect to a bare metal host and have that host join the coco pool.
