May need a UI component for this.

At the very least, a markdown editor with preview should pop up.

Managing sessions should be with a dedicated viewer too, rather than just pure text in the chat session.

Pattern should be start with the in chat version, generated using the bot, then move on to a more finessed tool to make the selection of items easier.

Can use the standard selector component for this.

If a viewer component had 3 modes - edit, diff, view - then the user should have all the tooling they need.  Maybe a file viewer ?

Select a block of text and indicate that this is included in the chat, so the bot will try to only change this individual paragraph or selection.  It may change other things, but it needs to do it as a two pass, where it changes what was requested, and then makes notes about descrepancies, and then fixes up the overall document as a second pass.
