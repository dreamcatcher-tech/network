May need a UI component for this.

At the very least, a markdown editor with preview should pop up.

Managing sessions should be with a dedicated viewer too, rather than just pure text in the chat session.

Pattern should be start with the in chat version, generated using the bot, then move on to a more finessed tool to make the selection of items easier.

Can use the standard selector component for this.
