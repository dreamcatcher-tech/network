We use it on our base chains, and we only allow calls from that isolate, but it is possible that a dev could use it on their own system, so long as they ran their own DB as a side effect ?

This means they could emulate artifact internally, completely ?

Should we be allowed to attach repos into the graph at any point, and perform repo level actions on them, and should we ever need to talk to the root chain for that ?
