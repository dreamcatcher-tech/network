This seems the key to our system, this dynamic tool loading, this roaming tooling type of thing.

so we have a very small number of minimal system functions and then the roaming tool allows it to load things up.

We might need ai assistance to get the core model to pick the right tool, by giving it a bit more thinking space, but that will shrink in future models and that seems easy to do on our side.

the call to laod tools goes out, and then the response comes back, but importantly, the notification of the tool change should go out before the tool response goes back.
