If we link to the actual help in the session metadata, then we can show the help, including the functions that are added in to it.

But what about showing the extra files or templates that might come with an agent image ?
That might be a browsing option.

Helps seem now very different to agents ?

Make a dictionary reconciler first perhaps.
