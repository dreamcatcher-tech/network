Be nice to be able to send a friend a news article, or tweet about it, and have paid to have no ads in it.  If you could just auto generate a paid link, and then it goes out and is valid for x amount of time.

Or the publishers also use the system so that people can pay directly.  Then if you found it useful you pay for yourself or pass it on to others.  Like a payment network / standard.
