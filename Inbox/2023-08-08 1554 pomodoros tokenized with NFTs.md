If the pomodoro app was always selecting a packet whenever work was done, then we could broadcast what tasks we were spending time working on.

If the work you did, as in keystrokes, and screen pixels were minted into an NFT, then the things you did during this session could be included.

The NFTs could be included as funding for the packet, merely using the packet as a way of storing information.

Offers a way for people to see what packets you are working on, to avoid collisions, or offer advice.
