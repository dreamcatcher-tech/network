We should be able to start multiple threads going concurrently, so we can update the UI and then also make a list of function calls.

This seems related to the ability to do a for loop or a while loop.

Cron jobs come later too.

So parallel runs of the test functions would be the most striking example of this.

The sooner we can get into workbench mode, the sooner we can stack our tools atop on another.

Make a vscode plugin so we can have good text editor but also run the AI with visual feedback.

The vscode in browser option could work here.
