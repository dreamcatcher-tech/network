In the Jitters store, the areas of functionality are AI assigned, and can also be altered by the user, so what appears is highly dynamic and not chosen by humans.

We would list stucks, by groups, but we would surface end functionality such as the CRM, or the blockchain components.  

So if you browse stucks, you interact with them using HAL, who groups them to things you want to see.  During searching, it can create things that need to be done.  HAL can sometimes know that you have asked for something unique, and can file on your behalf.
