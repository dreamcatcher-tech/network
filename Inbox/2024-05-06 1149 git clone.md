With auth, we would require the PAT, which is held by the github auth repo.

When something wants to clone, it needs to be done by the parent that is commissioning the repo really - a repo cannot cause a clone to go into itself it seems ?

Pull can be done into something with shared history.

We should always make an artifact branch that is for execution, so we never change the base branch.  When we want to commit to main, that should be an explicit action. 

ghauth needs to have create a branch to store the auth and interactions of a particular user.
So when it does the auth loop, it results in a branch that stores the PAT in the fs.
When an authenticated actor makes a request to do a clone of a url, that actor would supply a PID and the url ?  The act of cloning creates the repoId, else permissions need to move with the request somehow, and clones need to be blank at the start.
