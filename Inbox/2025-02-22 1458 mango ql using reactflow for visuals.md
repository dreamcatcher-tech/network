Think that every query we could make could be represented as a flow.

Then can have executions like a series of messages down the side.

The importance of the query language being an inert json language is so that LLMs can write these flows themselves, if given the freedom to do so, and so that humans can write them too, but then the visual side makes it understandable.

The visual side needs a language to constrain its rules.  Else what it can do is to wild and varied.

So by maintaining the language, then the visuals become fairly simple to keep in sync.
