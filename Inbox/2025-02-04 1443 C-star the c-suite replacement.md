C*.

A C suite as a service.

Can be a servant to existing C suite members, or the board, or it can be the actual controls.

Underneath, a system that records all interactions is subtly required.

The C suites role is to look at all the available information and make the best decision for the company.  AI is naturally best at this role.

Nobody would shed a tear on replacement of the c suite.

It figures out the optimum incentives for staff.

All staff can talk to c* at any time and if they say something valid, c* will update its policies.

C* LLC can be paid by C* figuring out what the fair value added is.

You can email them, or you can give access to your inbox.

The LLC can give the operator legal power, and will manage the contractual relationships and liabilities.

Can provide services that C* can call upon natively, like legal insurance, certified advice.

Basically if it can have access to accounting services that are instant, it can make a better decision.
