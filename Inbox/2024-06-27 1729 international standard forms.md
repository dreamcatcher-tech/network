If we use chains to represent forms shared between companies, and then use their AIs to interpret them the same way, then so long as the interpretation is sound, and if we test the translation of all the generated stuff, then we should need less specialization for translation.

The forms become golden reference, then the AIs are used to interpret them and to pass messages between multinational interested parties.  Can also answer questions without people being present.

Start by looking at the company knowledge base, then reach out to custodians of the other company knowledge base.
