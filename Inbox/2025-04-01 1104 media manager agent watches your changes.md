Each time some change occurs, it gets on social media and announces, as well as comissions articles to be written about the change and why.

It bugs other agents for material, if a roadmap item is approaching completion.

When it gets the long form articles, then it breaks them up into little twitter chunks.

Also communicates the roadmap, and handles feedback on that roadmap.

Posts across multiple media channels, and responds whenever someone messages.

Corals all comms into a single channel and filters them so humans can answer.

Deduplicates all questions, so that it only asks a human once, then stores the response, and uses this to immediately get back to all other question askers.
