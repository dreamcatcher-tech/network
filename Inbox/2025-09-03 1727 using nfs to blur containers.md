If we had, say, one massive mega image that contained everything we wanted, then we can make the images super light since they would just be this super light thing that every time you wanted to do something, it would pull in the code from this nfs layer, so the booting image stays minimal.

the nfs setup can code capabilities, and it only locally caches whatever is needed.

mounting nfs as fuse.
