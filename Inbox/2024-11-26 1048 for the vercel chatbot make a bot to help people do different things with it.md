basically a help file that blends in the issues and other things about the bot.

If we attach ourselves as a middleware, or some other insertion point, then we can be an actual help bot about the vercel runtime.

We can alos offer stuck processing, which is the upvote downvote stuff that converts these into stucks.

Can optionally offer model distillation in a semi autonomous way, to save costs of models.
