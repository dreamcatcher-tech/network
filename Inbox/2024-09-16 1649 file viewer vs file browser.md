Showing both the browser and the file at the same time seems pointless.
The commit browser should be visible along with the file browser and the file viewer.
Branch viewer should be above the commit browser.

But we don't want to destroy the explorer, since it has some state within it.

The focused file should be visible to the prompt.

Opening shouldn't need to go via the prompt, since this is far too slow
