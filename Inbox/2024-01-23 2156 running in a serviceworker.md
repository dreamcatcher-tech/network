If we can run in a serviceworker, then we can accept the github callback code to have us logged in.

Actually no, since we need the client secret for our app as well.

Best short term option is a cors proxy.

Might make a dir snapshot to give the first load from a binary asset, rather than requests out ?

Or, mount the remote repo inside of a virtual generated first repo.

Helps could be mounted by backing files for fast load.

If the goal is to get a github login, so we can have write access to a repo, then setting up a callback for github auth seems best option.

Or we could just set up a private git server, with no permissions ?
