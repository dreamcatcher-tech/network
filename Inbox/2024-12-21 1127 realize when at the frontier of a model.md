If we run multiple tries on the model and get wild variance, we can say the model is not sure.  This means we are at the frontier, and this is a good place to do work to attempt to stabilize the context or the model or both.

Without context, the smartest model on earth is dead, so context is actually the value, and to use the models to generate context as fast as possible is the race.

So the dreamcatcher needs to be the place where people prefer to store, access, and create their context, and share it with each other.
