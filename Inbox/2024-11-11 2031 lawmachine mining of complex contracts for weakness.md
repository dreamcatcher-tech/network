If we could reason about contracts strongly, we could find loopholes and race conditions.

Lawyers are programmers, and they aren't doing it right.  If we can reason about loopholes then we can exploit them.

Ideally find them in public law so they can be patched, and we get paid out enough to find the next loophole.
