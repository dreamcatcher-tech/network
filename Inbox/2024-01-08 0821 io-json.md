might need to register the io objects in procman using symlinks so that the format is always assured.  Else what would preserve the format ?

The procman is a form of git commit trigger.

This is what makes the io file special, in that it is registered with the procman.

?? where is the right place to trigger the procman ?  in a commit ?
After a commit seems right, since io could have come in from anywhere.
