might need to register the io objects in procman using symlinks so that the format is always assured.  Else what would preserve the format ?

The procman is a form of git commit trigger.

This is what makes the io file special, in that it is registered with the procman.

?? where is the right place to trigger the procman ?  in a commit ?
After a commit seems right, since io could have come in from anywhere.

Piercings have to be committed before acting on them, else we can't know what we were starting with, so cannot reproduce in some cases.
Internal actions do not need to commit, as they could have kept going indefinitely.

If the proctree was the actual channel files, then where they got placed on the filesystem can be the symlink.  Could just use a flat PID system to track them all ?
Putting them in a specific place seems best if we ever want to cut that piece off at some point, which means the actual channel should be in the location it is being used.

The procman can be an LLM for some of its work.
