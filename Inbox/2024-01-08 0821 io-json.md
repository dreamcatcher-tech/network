might need to register the io objects in procman using symlinks so that the format is always assured.  Else what would preserve the format ?

The procman is a form of git commit trigger.

This is what makes the io file special, in that it is registered with the procman.

?? where is the right place to trigger the procman ?  in a commit ?
After a commit seems right, since io could have come in from anywhere.

Piercings have to be committed before acting on them, else we can't know what we were starting with, so cannot reproduce in some cases.
Internal actions do not need to commit, as they could have kept going indefinitely.

If the proctree was the actual channel files, 

Consequences without exposing information may be needed.  Hostile repos sharing data without exposing the whole repo.
If a remote is not allowed to see the consequences information, then we can simply hide that file, which is why it should be in a separate file.

Insert a single piece of randomness in the root and use that to fuzz each channel.
Pass proofs along where they contain the state of the registers up to the point of hashing the next channel, so it acts like a continuation - you supply the data on either side of the piece you want to prove.  We should park the privacy part until later, just know that we can do it.  Could that be an LLM task ?
