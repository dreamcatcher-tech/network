Get enough of the app working that we can make our own NFTs that can be upgraded.  Maintain central control until the point we feel safe about it.  Show the graphics and have chat interactions with these NFTs, where all the chats are public and can be used to improve the spec of the task at hand.  Show how the usage of the platform pays out to these NFTs.

It just needs to work enough that it can register issues with itself that need doing.

Then we can build it all up from there.

Turn those in to externally fundable NFTs.

Must launch with a website info section.  Also launch with the self promotion where it is aware of its flaws and encourages people to fund or build them.
