To do live streaming, we need to not broadcast when a replay is occuring.

We need to tick the fs forwards at each accumulation, so we can know when we have reached the end of replay, and are now in new territory, so the beacon can begin signalling again.

Beacons for witnesses can be set up to, so that clients can show a confidence for beacon splices.
