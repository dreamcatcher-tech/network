If you all agreed on the updates, but the rules were just english, then you could still maintain useful consensus.  Indeed this is how political systems work.

So what need have we of a blockchain if we have a git based ledger and consensus on what the next commit is ?

how much scrutiny we put on checking the commit is entirely up to us - it could be just plain english rules.

then we run message passing techniques so that all the entities know how to message pass and not get fooled, which is what humans would have to do anyway.

then we can all talk and chatter to reconcile differences in git, and vote intelligently.

So then these agents need not have any hard coding except some prompting, and they can still all agree on the next commit ?

diversity is important so they all don't get conned ?

they might figure out their own structure of deeper governance.
