Thread store some state which can hold the switchboard summary of agents.

Attach this as part of the state.

So have the description of the agents stored in state.

Or have a tool that updates the descriptions at built time.

Set what the switchboard can toggle between.

System boot needs to ensure the thread state is prepopulated.
