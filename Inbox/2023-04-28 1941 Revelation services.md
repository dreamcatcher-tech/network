Timed revelation as a service.

Blind betting in a casino depends on the gambler keeping their bet secret until they claim a win.  The gambler may fall offline, or their computer might die, cheating them of their winnings.  A Revelation service can be used to place the bets thru, such that the Rev service will only trigger the gambling service once it has received and distributed the gamblers private information.

Reveletion can be conditional, based on the execution of some logic and some external events.

Revelation needs to be widely distributed, and it needs to have an auditor so that if it failed in its obligations, then it is punished.  It can be protected against clients divulging info by encrypting the private data onto the chain, and only offering payments if someone can decrypt this stored info.  Whilst the service operators could intercept the raw private data, this is impossible to separate from the actions of the client, and this data should be deleted immediately.

Allows casinos to be constructed that can give their clients security of operation whilst separating responsibilities to remove themselves from liability.
