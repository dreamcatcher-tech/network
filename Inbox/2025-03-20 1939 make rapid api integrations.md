Many systems are being forced to open, like banks.  We should make integrations with them so we can push out other api companies, since they used to be needed, but a cheaper, lighter, more responsive, AI generated system is coming there way.

If we already have a base userbase, then we can invest on a per conversion basis too, which increases the chances that an integration will get done, and offers more breadth, which is like network connections in terms of value delivery.
