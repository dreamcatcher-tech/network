Just as there are a list of governance models for voting, there are also a set of AI boosted governance models, where AI handles much of the smoothening, and humans provide the final votes.

Eg: if you have a house and a factory is going to be built next door, then your vote should matter more than someone 100km away, and the AI handles the weighting based on some principles, rather than requiring some concrete system programming.

All the previous voting systems can be considered mechanical, whereas new AI models can be far more natural and intelligent, approaching a benevolent dictator.
