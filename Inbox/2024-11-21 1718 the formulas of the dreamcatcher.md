Describe them as sum of all the individual contributions.

We might be able to make a normalized equation which works out relative attribution.

If we compare everyones contribution with everyone elses then after several loops, the change should not be much ?
Basically generate relative numbers.

Sum each individual contribution, then segment to the people that did them ?

Formula needs to be easily understood by everyone, easily interrogated.  Must be very simple. 

We could probably make some eval rules for how this works, as in going thru some real world examples, and then having a guess at the relative weights.

There are potentially many formulas we could apply, but the core general formula is that we take all the contributions recorded, and then
