Describe them as sum of all the individual contributions.

We might be able to make a normalized equation which works out relative attribution.

If we compare everyones contribution with everyone elses then after several loops, the change should not be much ?
Basically generate relative numbers.

Sum each individual contribution, then segment to the people that did them ?

Formula needs to be easily understood by everyone, easily interrogated.  Must be very simple.
