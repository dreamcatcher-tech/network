Describe them as sum of all the individual contributions.

We might be able to make a normalized equation which works out relative attribution.

If we compare everyones contribution with everyone elses then after several loops, the change should not be much ?
Basically generate relative numbers.

Sum each individual contribution, then segment to the people that did them ?

Formula needs to be easily understood by everyone, easily interrogated.  Must be very simple. 

We could probably make some eval rules for how this works, as in going thru some real world examples, and then having a guess at the relative weights.

There are potentially many formulas we could apply, but the core general formula is that we take all the contributions recorded, and then work out relative value, for a given usage, then attribute back to each person based on the sum of their relative contribution values.

Harnesses that valuable contributions happen a lot.

In the evals, can try to game the system, and produce odd results.  Test bias towards certain types of contribution.  Detect long running frauds, like gradually changing the code and then ending up back where it was before, but having defrauded the original contributors.

Test against different classes of value.

First step is to compare the relative value of all the different classes of contribution.

Basically we can black box the basic algorithm, and treat it like a magic function, then try out different wants of fulfilling those requirements, with fairness being the goal, and cost, understanding, and explainability being the balancing goals.
