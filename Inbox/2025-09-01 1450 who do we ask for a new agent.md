what about for a new app ?

what if it's just the self agent ?

it HAS to go thru artifact, but ultimately the execution of it could be the self agents ?

but we might defer this restriction ?

artifact could run on your home app ?

artifact provides recoverability, so we can probably skip that for now.

self agents can have a deploy key in their secrets.

the home agents would have an mcp server that they would allow other agents to access, as well as themselves.
when they call the right tools here, they would be able to create new machines, and store their mapping somewhere.
Probably just on their permanent disk for now.
