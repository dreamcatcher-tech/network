If we make the runtime, which is always permanent, and then that connects up to the provider interface, then we make some parts of the provider, which implements git, and then writes out to 

But then, the provider interface almost doesn't matter, since it gets implemented anyway ?

But then we split it to do web server versions as well as local versions.

The web proxy just presents the same interface, but uses a web server to then connect to a local running instance of the provider that talks to the db.

For testing, we should make a ram based logging version of the blob stores?

Provider should do caching of the calls ?

Provider client should cache calls.
