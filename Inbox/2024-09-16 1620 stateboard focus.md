If the stateboard focus and widget was written to disk, then we could adopt a default of being the current target branch, but if something different is given, our focus changes.

The api should be dropped in at the top of the stack, and stateboard should not display unless we have at least a branch to focus on.

If the stateboard was showing without any pid, then it defaults to the current thread PID.
