If the browser cannot connect to any of the preconfigured chains, then load an inbrowser version for demonstration purposes.

Preconfigs are chainIds and multiaddresses.  Each one can be a separate instance to display.

If the loaded chain fails the version check for the UI components, then display the default browser UI.
