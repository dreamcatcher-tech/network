Often we hear of struggling startups that want our help, and we have no formal tracking system for them.  We should provide a tool to model them, and to broadcast their status to anyone in our network.

We can put some privacy limits on this information, and allow our networks of people to see these status flags.

Pull in info from company registries and other sources.
