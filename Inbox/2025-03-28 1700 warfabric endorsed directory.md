Have a friends of friends mapping, like a social network.

sort of like facebook for war.

have directories that are published with difference clearance levels for different people.  You can be searched in this directory, and added to cmd controlled projects in this way.

Being command controlled means that permissions are handled using our list.  You can override this, but the basics are these contracts.  They might be tied to legal contracts.

Solves the problem of discovery of other participants, and solves the adding the wrong person mistake.  If the repo is controlled by cmd, then you can set a clearance level, and you can't make that mistake.

Lost credentials can be automatically broadcast.

You can determine good trust by friends of friends.

Friend requests let you link up and network, so that adding people from outside your friends list raises an alarm.

Can vouch for others, and give them trust credits.  Can be multi dimensional.  If you sponsor people who do good, you get kudos too.

Once we have the social net, we can do things like prediction markets, weighted speaking, classified info disemenation, delayed info disemenation.  share differing degrees of the roadmap.

Credits sharing, funding, staking using money.

Repos could be controlled by the cmd agent, which would oversee all permissions changes.  It could also report up the chain to keep higher levels abreast of activity.  Provide effort dedupe across multiple repos.

Could run in isolated mode, where it doesn't actually transmit any data, but just gives advice and takes management actions in confidential mode.
