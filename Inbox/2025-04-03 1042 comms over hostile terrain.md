drop little radio beacons that can relay signals back, so that RF jamming is less effective.

put them in trees so they're higher.

Or lay a fibre cable out to an end station, auto pilot the drones to be in range of this transmitter, then have multiple drones in range, all using the same fibre spool.

Stil, the ultimate is if the drone can do its decision making on its own.
