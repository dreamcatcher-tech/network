to allow artifact to be invoked directly, without mcp is still valuable ?

this should be a layer below, which is the direct invocation layer.

if we make the server actually occur within the client, then the server translates to actions that hit the remote chain, that might avoid much of the comms overhead, and make it be purely artifact protocol ?
