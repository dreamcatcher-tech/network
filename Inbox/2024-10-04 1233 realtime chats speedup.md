Currently our chats go off to artifact base for processing.

But with realtime chat, we cannot afford to do that, which breaks our computing model.

So if we do heavy and serious things in the message history, and we have a more dynamic, transient conversation with the user, then only the commited things go in to the message thread.

Progress on this completion should be fed back in to the voice model, so it is aware on the progress of long running tool calls.

We can also play back the audio speed faster than realtime.

So the realtime voice becomes more like a way for the bot to then generate NL inputs into the heavier system.
