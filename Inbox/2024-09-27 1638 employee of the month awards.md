We should set up some scoring metrics for each of the agents, like the number of times they got called, total input and output tokens, so we can measure highest earner, number of error corrections that each one had, number of stucks it generated, number of successful outcomes, number of tools called, and then we can give employee of the month awards to each of the agents. This could also be used to show which agents are worth improving, because they'll earn you more money.
