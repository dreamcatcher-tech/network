if you solved a problem and found it was useful to other people, that would earn you back funds or tokens ?  You could opt to consume the prior solve or something ?

from smax:

> Could it work if it was free at the point of use with the aim being to maximise the production of Stucks, and take a skim on all escrowed funds against stucks?  I'm thinking about the network effect and maximising for that.  If the generation of Stucks is the valuable stuff, and the solution to stucks shows demand, then escrow alone could be the revenue stream.  It would cost in the early days so would need funding, but above a trigger level, with enough escrow and say 20% skim, then it possibly could be zero cost to use, more expensive to solve something that you care about (but you want it solved), but importantly has a larger base of talent/demand/stucks to draw on.

I think that's gold actually.  Free might not work, but subsidized would definitely work.  That's vital because AI will always cost money, and I have not yet seen a model where the tokens cost less than vendor price - but being even slightly cheaper would get far more users than competing with the same price as all the other AI platforms

In some areas it might be able to be free, like in say, cafe or restaurant management software, we could give the software and the tokens away in exchange for a cut of whatever supply chain purchases get made thru our marketplace

could score people on their stuck production or induction - if you generate auto stucks a lot, that can pay for your usage.

but if you just play around and you find genuinely new stucks, you should get subsidized by the innovation gains

that's almost like an internal currency peeking out there, based on the balance of trade between stuck creation, escrowed solving, and ambiently attributed value creation as a result of that solving

ultimately ambient attribution should ensure that most people, if they behaved innovatively, would have free AI

so you could set up funds that will sponsor token costs up front in exchange for the ambient attribution that results
