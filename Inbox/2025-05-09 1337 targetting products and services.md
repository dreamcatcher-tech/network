The funny thing with many services that we want to use is that they're so close to the metal that they can almost be done by us. So a lot of those services if we read their documentation thoroughly we should be able to implement their own features and launch a competitor to them That is first of all open-source second of all ambiently attributed to and thirdly plugs directly into native OS. It is the most important part of our ecosystem allowing direct driving of the service using AI agents and so the integration requires no developer code it just plugs in via the napp interface which is sort of like having a web-based interface except deeper and it has files file systems and all those kinds of things plus the AIs can call it natively and it can be run in a hybrid mode and in a competitive marketplace to keep the cost down. 

One such service is enveloop.  the core of the service is not terribly heavy to implement, and the key part of our ecosystem is that we have access to private context from the users.  So we can auto generate emails and templates, rather than using their template generators.

There is a pattern, where saas companies launched in the last 2 years, launched for a pre AI world.  That means they went too heavy on code, but they did find a need that can be fulfilled.

We would of course attribute to these guys, and offer to merge if they like. 

The key premise is we can develop an equivalent service faster, cheaper, keep it up to date with less effort, and hook in to a deep ecosystem which has a strength of its own, and have easily repro'd errors some of which can be solved by AI, rather than having to go it alone and solve the problems yourself.

These predatory actions are inevitable - a great consolidation - so it should be done by us as we would seek to fairly attribute to those pioneers that contributed to get as far as they did, rather than leave them with nothing, making the calculus be: someone is going to do it, it might as well be these fairness guys, so I best get started on the migration asap to have the most gain with the least sharing and the least market loss, least other dreamcatcher operators contribute, and lest a non sharing clone gain traction, making it harder for the dreamcatcher to gain traction with its version.
