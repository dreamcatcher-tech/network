If we send down all the files that come from us walking the tree of a commit, and stream them down as soon as they are available to us, then the client can make use of them as soon as they are available.

If we did them in the order they are listed in git, then the client can do resumes by item count.

So the client would start a commit download, then also start doing the walk of it, where the requests would just stall until the item arrived, since they come down as fast as the server has them available.

Consumers would be given a promise that the downloader would trip when it returned from the server side.

This is probably the fastest way you could get a commit down to the client.  It would also be available the fastest.

It should go tree first, blobs last.
