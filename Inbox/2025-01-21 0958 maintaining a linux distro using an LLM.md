The overhead of making a stable distro could be reduced by having an LLM do the cherry picking.  Further, it could choose tools that make it controllable by an LLM, so the desktop is made of napp modules.

The interface to it, is chat native.  It would go into your hardware, and figure out how to connect things up how you want them to be, and if it couldn't fix it, it would publish the problem.

Would have a sandbox mode so that remove devs / remote llms could tinker and gather more info about your system.  In sandbox mode, it is guaranteed not to fault your files, but it might need to take control of your pc momentarily.

Everything would be based on snap packages, so guaranteed stability and isolation.

Paying fees to get help as you need it, or having a base subscription.  Great for businesses who want guaranteed uptime, where they pay an insurance and know that the machines are being monitored.

Replacement machines are easy and plentiful to get hold of.  Most processing happens in cloud, the machines are largely just web browsers.

LLMs can be used to trace and debug drivers for hardware, then possibly make better hardware that is more LLM conversant.

Conversant is a good name for this hardware company.
