Uses a web view so bundle size is small.

We could make it provide artifact as a system api almost, and then coding an artifact app almost instantly works on tauri.

So we'd make a shim to go from artifact to the OS hooks plus a dedicated artifact node.

tauri could be used to discover other peers on the local network.
