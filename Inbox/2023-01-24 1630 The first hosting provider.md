Make dreamcatcher.cloud as the first public host for dreamcatcher chains.  Touted as the cloud killer, this is the last cloud service you need, and is a transition service to help migrate away from cloud hosted infrastructure.

Provide the tooling for anybody to run their own public cloud.

Offer differing privacy, security, priority, and edge distribution settings.

Nobody is likely to pay for the dreamcatcher pieces themselves as they are too esoteric, but with specific products we can use the dreamcatcher as a means of enabling these pieces.  Some of the funding can go towards the underlying pieces, and can be shared with other companies.  Probably the more this shared infrastructure can be spread around, the better.

The [[Public Company]] can act as a bit of a catch all, where it has some dedicated apps it seeks to build, but it also contributes to the underlying infrastructure too.
It is identified by the people that manage the funds distribution, capital raising, divident payouts.

## Hosting Blogs
When long form content gets published, have a link to the DRE chain that contains the content within it.
Convert popular pages into git page commits periodically, so that there is no load on the hoster itself for popular links.
Have a version of the attribution map present, so people can see where the attribution goes, if any funding is received.
Having the public host up and running makes it very easy to start using and developing the apps required to use the chain, where we can decentralize the operation of the chain later.
Run as one big lambda cluster for compute, with a bunch of docker containers acting as the front line for managing libp2p connections.  When you pass initial auth, then you can move to more performant docker containers.
