at page load, we could supply a json object as a url header, which we could decode, this could serve as the default data ?

then if new messages come in, what would they be ?

messages out would be in the format for the widget manager.
The would include context changing, and some free form data.
so a standard format for scope, and some freeform json for anything else that might be asked for - like state.

So the privy widget would send up typed messages with payloads
1. state
2. context which lists selection order and names primary selection by integer
3. 

send a navigate to message.
or an artifact message.
artifact messages would be provider messages, which would be filtered by the parent.

artifact comms out would be just provider actions.
artifact has some ping methods.
