In git, complex merges can easily occur.
Writing code to do a recursive merge strategy is painful.

Instead if we had an AI to do the merge management, then it can be aware of what the user was trying to do, and should be able to generate nicer outcomes anyway, as well as intelligently handling conflicts.

Conflicts should be graceful, and going back to different versions should be trivial for the AI to navigate around.
