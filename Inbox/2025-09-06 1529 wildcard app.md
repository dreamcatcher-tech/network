this receives all the wildcard traffic.

is this simply the default app which receives this traffic ?

it then looks up its registry of computers that it has which match the name, and then it does fly redirect on that ?

this computer is just set up a special way, it isn't different in terms of code.

everything missing goes back to the default computer, which starts up its root agents to chat.
