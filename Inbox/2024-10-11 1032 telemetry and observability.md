Is there a way to calculate our own span metrics within the system by using all of the commits to store performance information about how long it took to do individual operations? So then to assemble a span report we would simply walk the commits and get the information about each individual commit so that we can generate a Gantt chart showing how each item progressed. And then when you click on the Gantt chart you go to a different commit, you see the exact action and you can start digging into the performance of the system more there.

Beats having an external telemetry service since we would end up digging thru commits anyway.
