Being able to pay and receive local currency, or overseas, to conventional suppliers.
Make sure that all island related activities are auditable by the citizens.
Ensure that all interactions with conventional companies are reputable, and do not bring the island into disrepute.
Share the knowledge of dealings with locals with all Island businesses.
Be able to change in and out of STC or other currencies easily.

Basically setting up a business on the island should require nothing more than a click, and then you are a mini company of the major DAO.  The major DAO provides rules that makes sure you cannot break any local laws at any time.  It owns the bank accounts and can send and receive payments, plus can enter into contracts with local suppliers.

Basically regulation of business should be in software only.
