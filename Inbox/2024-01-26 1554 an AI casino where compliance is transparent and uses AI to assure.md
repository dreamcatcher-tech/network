Compliance in different jurisdictions seems complex.  We could assemble AI tooling that helped to determine the legality of operating in different jurisdictions, as well as things like how strong proof of address and proof of funds needs to be.

We would be high resolution terms of reasoning with our customers as to how things are going and what is required of them.  We would be standard and fair across all users since our rules would be defined in AI and executed transparently.  When the regulator talks to us, this is transparent too.

this is the same as a crypto exchange, so these functions are the same.  So we could run a network of businesses, including dcrypto exchanges, casinos, and other industries that are plagued by compliance issues.  Then atop all that, we have insurance pools and AI law pools to cover losses that were not predicted.  These pools are open to anyone to back too.

If in dreamcatcher there was a regulator built in at the top level, then we could use this web of services to run legit businesses with ease.  The platform cut to upkeep these services is transparent and should be quite high, but is much cheaper than running all these things yourself, especially if you consider time to start - you should be able to begin operating within a day in dreamcatcher.

The network would assure you that you were trading respectably in all jurisdictions, and without information disclosure.  By separating the information verification out from the transactions it can be efficient for all participants with minimum duplication and maximal trust.

The users will like understanding how the whole process works, and will appreciate not having their access cut for no good reason other than the fear that their single case might damage the platform - treating users opaquely is bad for the platform.
