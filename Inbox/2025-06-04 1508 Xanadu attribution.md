A great many projects were inspired by Xanadu, but the futuristic author did not receive much royalty, and only a little recognition.

So a demonstration of how our royalty system works and how everything we do would trickle a little back to Xanadu is probably a valuable thing.  If we could show a system that would support the author capitalizing on much of their promotional efforts (finally) this is likely a system that will gain support, and possibly user base from them.

The key hurdle to overcome is can an externally set price be compatible with the Xanadu ideals.

It sounds like Xanadu can be constructed, since it is not a form of the true scotsman problem, where Xanadu can only be constructed by Ted Nelson.

With the ai assistants portion, any faults or problems with the system could be captured as innovations and accredited to the authors.  Thank them for taking the time to comprehend what the differences were between what we were making and what they wanted.

His core gripe seems to be about the lack of attribution for ideas.  Particularly in the information age.  So a system that heals this wound ought be received well.

So if we could demonstrate a system that would recognize their feedback with attribution, that should encourage them to contribute.
