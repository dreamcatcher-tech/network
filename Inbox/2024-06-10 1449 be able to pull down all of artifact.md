Should be able to run it locally, so can survive offline.

Then can merge back when online again.

If had a local deno version, then this would work.

Should work with only partial downloads.

Save the sessions of things you are interested in.  Save all, or save using MRU eviction.  Allow permanently pinning of some items.  Use p2p to sync locally between different instances.

On android, this can be native.
