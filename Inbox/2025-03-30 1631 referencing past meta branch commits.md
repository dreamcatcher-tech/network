When talking about a scope, we might be talking about a branch that had been deleted.

So we would need a way to talk about the branch at a previous meta state ?

permit to be reset or altered in any way because, if that gets reset, we would lose the state of all the branches across the repo and would require resynchronization. It would effectively push the whole repo back to a prior state.
