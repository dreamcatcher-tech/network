Every reasoning domain has the same basic pieces

- a list of outstanding questions that need answering
- ingestions - source material, like the ingested transcripts, meetings, and other ingestions
- corrections, which are useful when ingesting, that can be per ingestion or across many ingestions
- base rules, that define what a reasoning domain is, what the purpose of the process is, and how to behave during the session

There may be more efficient ways to talk when reviewing these materials, to make the ingestion process better.
Ideally it would be happening in realtime while we chat.
