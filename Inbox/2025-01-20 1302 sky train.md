Making the SkyTrain system using a large ferris wheel type device, or really just an arm, that can catch the incoming planes and can also rapidly launch the outgoing planes, because the efficiency of an airtrain is that the drones keep flying, and as long as they maintain a certain amount of speed, the wings keep them aloft. We don't want to have to invest enough energy or motors that these devices can land anywhere, because there's no point touching down. They're meant to be very cheap, be able to carry a very large load a very long way with very little energy. And so you catch them out of the air while they're flying, and then you launch them again so that they're in the air, and they should be able to carry quite a lot of payload, and so even if you were doing water firefighting, you'd kind of fill them up and then fling them, and then catch them again when they land. And so you end up with a near steady, like if you could get a launch rate of like one every five seconds or something, that's like quite a heavy amount of load that can be delivered somewhere very cheap. You could then have some specialist devices that can do vertical lifts, and they can do like ferrying jobs or like pick a drone up, get it up to speed so it can fly again and then let it go, but in general the efficiency comes from using wings.

Basically ability to deliver huge amounts of constant mass efficiently and cheaply via air.

Might tie the planes together so they pull on each other reducing the need for power ?
