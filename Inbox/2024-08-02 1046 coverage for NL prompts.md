One NL bot could assess and test for the impact of particular parts of the prompt to calculate coverage.

If you remove the suspected low impact area of the prompt, then measure the outcome, we can figure out the importance of each part.

If the prompt is built up incrementally, then increases in test passing can be used to measure the importance of a particular piece.

zero coverage lines are those that the AI thinks can be removed and when removed the test results are exactly the same.

When business rules are set, the tests should be automatically generated and saved, that execute each scenario.

Full immersion tests are a complete story, which should then be able to be done, but this doesn't test the business rules, it rather helps the business rule authors and test developers get an overview of the system.
