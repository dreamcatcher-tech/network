As we move into the age of voice transcription, auto-correct, or being able to go back and check the text, should allow you to go back, touch on an area or a word, and then the voice transcription alternatives can pop up, plus when you correct it, it can say that it's going to learn a new word, so it becomes like a voice keyboard. You should be able to scrub the words like a timeline, and see what it said, and people should be able to do this retrospectively, so that when you enter some text, the voice comes in with it, so that it can be modified later, or at the very least learned from.
