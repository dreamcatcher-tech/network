If HAMR could be built in a way that the set of changes to the accounts was in a constrained format, and had a bunch of logical checking against it, then we might be able to make a pretrained model, that was continually trained, which could take a bank export, and automatically propose what the changes it was going to make to the accounts would be.

Each time it gets corrected, this would be transformed into a set of learning data.

Key is to make systems that take in strictly structured data and allow an LLM to try multiple times to get it right.  Helpful human readable error messages will help the LLM reach conclusion faster.
