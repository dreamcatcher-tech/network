add a second field, for the full path.

we could return the full path in the meta object, or we could just return the immediate name like git does.

seems cleanest to change what ls returns to be just the name

in sharding, the name should be the legit name ?
plus raise a flag that it is a sharded object ? or provide some extra shard info on meta ?
