Given a spreadsheet of care label details, we need to check the info made it into the images correctly.
May have a range of other checks we want to run.
Can ultimately have an 'as printed' photo attached by a person, which is used to check the samples are correct too.

When the human notices an error in the comparison, we can use this as a stuck.

New models and new approaches to the tooling should be rerun on these past errors and if it has a lower error rate, it gets committed.  If it disagrees with a previous known good result, we would want to look at that closer to approve it manually.

No exception is treated as a good result.
