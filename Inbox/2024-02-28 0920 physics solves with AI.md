The physics models would always need to be fronted by an LLM.

We may never have a physics AI model, but we might approach it.

But, we could train it inside of a FEA environment, so that it sees many operations occuring and develops a base understanding of the parametric moves it can make and the outcomes.

We can make an interface where an LLM knows how to manipulate a physics simulator, and can compare outcomes.  It can do these in parallel, and can evolve a design using broad parameters, as it starts to hone in on good designs.

Using deno as our parallelism, we could have this run in parallel in many places and so it would appear near instant as it presents the best option it has found so far.
