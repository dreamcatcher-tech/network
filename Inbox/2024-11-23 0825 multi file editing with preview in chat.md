Needs to have a way for the model to demarcate what the edits it needs to make are.

Then put that in to some kind of viewer.
Possibly reparse the text to check that the boundaries are right, so that we can correct them and patch them after the fact.

Then click on it would show it up in the main view ?  Or show all the edits concurrently ?

Pulling up in stateboard makes it seem more official and cleaner ?
