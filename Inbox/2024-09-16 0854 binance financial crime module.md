Make it both tooling and a service with humans backing it that detected financial crime.

Make it work cross entity, so it could sniff out banks dealing badly as well as crypto exchanges.

Banks must be trying to do the bare minimum, and so this tool would point the finger at them too.

Publicize detections, which is damning for the senders and receivers.

If the crime was made public, and the entities it occured in made public, and it linked to on chain transactions, then we haven't really done anything wrong.  Provides pressure to get banks to use the tooling, but also puts crypto in the clear, since it is where the laundering ends, and the banks cannot be as transparent as the blockchains.

Unbundling of the exchange makes it easier to build up pieces rapidly.  Keeps everyone honest too.

Seems all these big exchanges rely on financial crime for their models to work.  So if we had a legit one, and just waited, plus built tools to track financial crime across entities, then we would eventually be in prime position, especially if we find out how to be compliant and profitable.  Compliance must be costing too much to do legitimately.
