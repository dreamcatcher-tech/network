Give it a drone function to generate a summary in a structured format, rather than reading the whole thing into context, since it could be huge.

When running, it could cut or sort the results back.

The reporter bot can be coded to generate a good structure that we like, as a basis for the requester to pass back and comment on.

It would pass back a file link to the summary, which it would show in the stateboard.
If the requester gets asked questions about it, then it could read it into memory, or it could generate a query that gets asked to the summarizer drone.
To ask follow up questions, we would use the commit that ended the drone last time, and restart the thread, so we get all the context.
