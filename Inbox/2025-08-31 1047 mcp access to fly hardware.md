only the special case app has access to the function 'create app'.

everything else has a coned command set that lets it only ask for a new agent.

this hides the creation of an actual container.

ultimately, what comes back, is on the proctree of this app, there is now a new agent.  Its running state is one of the lifecycle states.

the browser can be connected to the agent face now, and we possibly show some connection status animations, like creating the container.

as soon as the face is up, we connect to it, and show that there might be some commands still running, like the git setup commands.

then it clears the screen and the tui takes over.  just like a linux boot.
