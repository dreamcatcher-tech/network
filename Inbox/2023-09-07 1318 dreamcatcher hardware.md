Wish is for a chair that if it breaks in any way, can instantly id the part in a 3d model, and request a replacement for a set price.  Locally the best route is calculated, including notifying local owners that a deal that meets their thresholds is available.  So the cheapest and fastest option is chosen between scavenge, repair, build replacement.

If the parts are all 3D printed, this can be even quicker to make.

Also if you want changes, put up a job to make and test these changes and optionally fund it using the dreamcatcher.

Saying that the supply chain is independent from the design studio.  The supply chain is cloud like, in that it can be anyone anywhere, and local modifications and compromises can be made.

If these devices contain sensors and network, then we can rapidly gather usage data to refine the designs.  We can gather more data than an in house lab since the real world users are the testers.  The Factory is the Home.

Each home would have a small set of special production capabilities, and a matter transport network is set up between them all.  This would have a faster response than a large factory half a world away.  It would be more responsive to disruptions due to climate, and would be more stable for pricing since it is affected by less.
