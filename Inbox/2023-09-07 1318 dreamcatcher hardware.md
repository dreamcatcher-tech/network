Wish is for a chair that if it breaks in any way, can instantly id the part in a 3d model, and request a replacement for a set price.  Locally the best route is calculated, including notifying local owners that a deal that meets their thresholds is available.  So the cheapest and fastest option is chosen between scavenge, repair, build replacement.

If the parts are all 3D printed, this can be even quicker to make.

Also if you want changes, put up a job to make and test these changes and optionally fund it using the dreamcatcher.
