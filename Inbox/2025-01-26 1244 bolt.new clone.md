Given that this tool is open source, we could snip it and fork it.

Could probably use the tool on its own source code, and then use o1 to merge in any upstream changes.

Then we can use the same interface for our own things too.

So we should find a way to insert o1 calls in as reasoning steps / architectural guidance.

Be able to do refactors by passing off to o1.

Like any task may start with a refactor step to see if we need a refactor before proceeding.

Check files if their functionality is broken the guidance for single function in a module.

Do a learning pass where the bot learns about a new library, by parsing its source code, so it can have confidence in how it uses the library, rather than relying on training data.
