we can call all these services from many agents to be sure we didn't miss anything.

basically the highest quality.

plus our own knowledge base about what sources of info we are starting to find more useful than others, and also requests for some commissioned work, like aggregating all the case law, or parsing some other large colleciton of knowledge in some way to make it more useful.

Merge these queries with others.

Find ways to do these queries lazily, so that only the requester does as much as they need, but push the overall forwards.
