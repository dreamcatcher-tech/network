if we go thru things like https://github.com/heidihoward/distributed-consensus-reading-list and we make an arena, where we make the pluggable versions of each algo runnable in the browser, and let you drive it and play with it graphically, as well as behaving in a byzantine way, plus let an LLM help show you how they run, or do big numbers of runs.

Then we can provide a central place to talk about and compare the different algos using a standard interface, AND we make it pluggable into our main networks.

Using AI generators, we could walk that list, organize it neatly, and then produce implementations of each algo that would mostly work.  We could start with TLA+ implementations of each one, and allow the model checker to run.

Can do sampling of properties when the run numbers get high, and showcase our worker based systems to do large calculations quickly.

perhaps quantum compute could help with these simulations ?
