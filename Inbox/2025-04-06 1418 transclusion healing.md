With the advent of AI systems, we can start to guess at what transclusions have already occurred in the mess that is the url web.  Some of these will be genuine discoveries, others will be guessed at and assigned a probability based on timing, connection webs, and models of information disemenation.

Going forwards we need a form of fuzzy transclusion where Transclusions that were used as a basis in RAG to generate some responses.  Not directly being transcluded, but knowledge being referenced.

Also we need a way to indicate transclusion in training of AI data, and hopefully some way to know when this knowledge contributed in inference in an attributable way.

The body of knowledge should be what the AI gets trained on, so as new knoweldge is ingested, multiple forks of AI are trained on what the factions of humans think is important or correct.
