this currency should be used for purchasing compute resource.

it should automatically pay out to all who contributed.

It should also be used to purchase and pay for software based
consumption.
The utility is in its intrinsic nature, lowering friction, and ability to make micropayments.

so long as we don't promote that you will make money from this decentralized attribution we should be ok ?  since it is not guaranteed, it is dangerous to even mention it.

So actually the currency is the key to the attribution agent, since if we operate using this agent, then we set the substrate for good behaviour.

you can purchase this currency but it smooths based on assets so you can't really expect to hoarde it.  There is no preminting, it is purely created thru usage, like how bitcoin was.

It is generated whenever you contribute anything and the minter, which is the attribution agent, sees that.

It can be created in negative amounts, which you create when you contribute, and then the agent runs.

So the currency, IS attibution.

Contributions can stay tied to an actor identity and cannot be moved or traded.
You can offer to give an actor money, to help with a certain thing, and all you'll get is a marker of your contribution.
