IF we let demanders pay workers directly, then we are a freelancing platform and subject to strict money laundering rules.

If we are the entity responsible for the work, and we fill those orders using crowd sourcing but we are ultimately responsible, then we should be able to have good banking relationships, since the responsibility ends with us.

We ensure the quality is good, so that genuine work effort has been expended. 

We take in payments using credit cards, and then we pay out the workers, using strict KYC to ensure we are compliant.

We can take care of their taxes for them too if they wish.
