instead of specifically giving a branch name, we could make it so it is to a PID, with the instructions to create it if it doesn't exist.
If it doesn't exist, then fail, but if it doesn't exist and `create` is true, then create the branch as part of the transmission.



arbitrarily deep branches could get created ?
