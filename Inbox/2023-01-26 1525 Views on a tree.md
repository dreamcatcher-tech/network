We need to store snapshots of the customers collections whenever a manifest is generated, so that when viewing the customers we can use the customers as they were at the time of creation.

Can make a tree that is a subslice of each of its children, so we are not storing large amounts of historical data.  We could also use this as a way of detecting changes we care about vs other changes that make no difference to us.

The state tree is one such view, and we might need to use that as a means of preserving data sizes.
