Having AI means we don't need to browse for answers.
But this means that there will be less answers for AI to train on, and so they may start to degrade over time.

The AI should generate more specific general questions, show the weight that is attached to them, and ask those for answer by genuine expert.

In this way the AI becomes a purchaser of intelligence.

Allows people to answer better, to already answered questions - becomes like stackoverflow, but only for the AIs asking highly focused questions, and rewarding highly useful answers.  Like the nerve center for intelligence, where collective holes in knowledge are plugged by experts for the benefit of all, especially the experts.

All the noise around intelligence sharing, or this kind of "semantic confusion" help, where the machines do all the shoehorning of questions into a nice format, and handle all the sorting and basic language issues with questions.

Subsystems based on this can be set up, like the solid starts website, that had a small set of experts, but were inundated with stupid questions.  So we could sell them a solution that took a cut of what they charge for their answers, but they supply the experts.  Better, we can bridge their experts with ours, so they can all be absorbed into the elastic pool, lowering costs for the vendor, increasing revenue for the experts.  The experts own their answers forever, and the royalty that goes with it.

This is an example of liability being attached to answers, which is another level of correctness.

So the NFT representing the knowledge is standalone almost ?  It could be sold and may be funded by external people who want to pay for someones expert answers in exchange for the AI royalty to come.

Any existing knowledge base site, private or public, can plug into our services.  We can provide things like wikipedia crunching for free.  This is like AI boosted wikipedia, where the AI has this high quality, realtime updated knowledge base, with a reward system to keep the knowledge fresh.  Better than web2.0 wikipedia - way to connect readers to writers with an AI in between.
