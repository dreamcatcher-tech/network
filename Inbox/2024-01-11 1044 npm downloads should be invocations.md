For a particular code that is in our format, we should be able to post stats on how many times it has been invoked, which indicates how many people chose to pay to use it, and burnt cpu time on running it.  The revenue of the item should be obvious, and the hot paths shown by the summation of coveration on the executions.

So the global public invocations post their coverages, which shows where it gets used a lot.

When you make a change, we can run all the prior calls on it, and can assess the outputs for improved speed, reduced bundle size, and other score metrics
