At any given point, we have questions, that are related to the context provided.

Forking should be natural, where we often fire of a lumpt of questions.

The bot should try to break apart questions in to atoms anyway, and add these to the knowledge tree.

Probably that extracted context is part of the long term learning memory, since any time you talk about that topic again, these questions should be part of your private context, and the questions and answers should be part of the broader knowledge base.
