Connect up B2 to allow binary to be uploaded.
Provide a way to browse and arrange these.
Have multiple views on the files, so people can arrange them however they see fit.
Store the backlinks so we can know when all links have been removed.

If we can offer complete file storage, and it is AI searchable, plus can make it available and synced up locally using a fs type adapter, we should be in business.

If we use the OPFS in the browser ?  This can allow for offline usage to occur too.
Harnesses the distinction between large binary files and repository text files.

The binary files could use bittorrent to replicate amongst local clients.

Then can track who has what pieces, so we can know if we are sufficiently replicated between all sites.

Then make an email server, so can take in the emails they are being shown.

? What if we could have all the browsing of the org go thru
