There is currently no marketplace where I can sell my computers CPU and GPU resources to do specific computations on as as needed case - I cannot serve other peoples applications in exchange for serving mine.  Single blockchains don't achieve this, as the energy is not used for useful computation.

Any time electricity is used to generate heat, this should instead by done using computational waste energy.
