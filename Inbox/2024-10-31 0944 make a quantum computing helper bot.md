Guides and reasons thru what the problem is, and specifies it in plain language and using math so we know it is a good fit for a quantum computer.

Then have a napp that can make quantum computing API calls, generate the code to make these calls, and then verify the result.

Check the results using small problem space classical code, so we know we are getting valid results back.

Use some of the quantum compute spend as a way to verify consensus.

> If we can add a hash to the API calls, then we can prove that we spend $x from some api that is proven by an SSL signature.

This is like, proof of spend.

We should be able to do this with any API that costs a lot of money to run ?

Or in paying for a monthly subscription ? add this note about what the tip hash is ?

This weight all adds up to be high powered consensus.
