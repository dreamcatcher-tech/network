if it was realtime multichannel audio capable, then it could be plugged in to any interface anyone chose to give it.

it could be decorated with video avatars and anything else.

it would be able to dial in to teams.
this is like having the agent install teams on its laptop.

could have whatsapp chats.
be a kiosk.

basically if this form factor is adopted, then the agents can be deployed anywhere, and being on low latency edge infra means very realtime type of interactions.

then if we have this general form, we can test and optimize it, then how we connect it up can be anything.

also the backend can have arbitrary data sources connected.
