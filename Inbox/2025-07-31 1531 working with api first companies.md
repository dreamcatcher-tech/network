some companies, like porkbun, fly.io attempt to be fully api first - we should convert those things into mcp services that people can use our ai models to manage.

build up a simulator, or a mock, that lets the machine try some things and observe the probably results.

take openapi specs and turn these into auto mcps, and then test, plus make the simulators for each one.

porkbun mcp would allow us to purchase and manage domain names on behalf of clients, give advice, and make any requested changes.

Our bots can give good advice on what to do - we can sell IT advice for super cheap, like $5 to get the advice certified.  Dealing with contentious things becomes important very fast, and is always squishy.
