So if we were making a deno module, it would insert a prompt and some context of examples of good modules that we should copy.

Maybe ask the human to provide some of these.

These are used to reflect upon when we consider if our output job is done.

It would say how to do imports, and what imports to use in the first place.

The structure of the task should always be to ask what the imports are and get the docs for those imports.

When working in a monorepo or workspace, can use the import map, and the shared vendor-docs folders

Vendor docs would be a configurable param for the concat file
