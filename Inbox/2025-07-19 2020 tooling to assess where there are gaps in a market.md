typically gaps sit there, and people go "surely that isn't right" and just look at the gap rather than doing something.  Then someone balsy does something and they assume that proves them right.

We should be able to spot and analyze all holes.  And project them, and project the compound effect of several of them, and get the timing right, too.

then juggle all the tasks required to get any one of them working.
