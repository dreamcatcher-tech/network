This single view defines the architecture of the whole system.

This defines what a bot actually is, and how does persistence work system wide.

### "show me my bots"

Some would be owned by you, others shared.

### "find me the ham CRM agent"
Finds a specific agent from the catalog, and once you are sure you have the right one, can start a session with it.
As permissions are hoisted, can merge in the main branch of the repo so you can now see all the files, as opposed to being in the login screen, or the customer portal screen.

### "show me my images"
This shows all the agent images you have used, or have running.
You can edit them, which makes a new fork.
You can opt to restart existing sessions with the modifications, or you can replay them from start.  Or this might not be possible since the branch could have changed.  Can start again from the last branch off of main.
