Benefit to us is far more thorough testing of our app, for far less effort, with the capabilities described in natural language, which can be agreed on with our customers.

So we're sort of dropping down with a platform, and app, and a project management technique.

Could simply start with time and materials, and we will try find others with the same problems to split the costs with.  Place a spend cap and see where it goes.  If you stop paying we might still provided fixes, but no guarantees.  We want to invite others to solve the problems instead of us as we have other things to do.
