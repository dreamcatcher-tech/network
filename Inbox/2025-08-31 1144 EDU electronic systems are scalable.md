if we can make an electronic teaching environment for one pupil, then we can scale this to many, very cheaply.

if it took up every room in the house, then we could use it as a child minder.  Parents can come and work from the same house, or we can have 1 parent watch 5 kids.

making it multi user seems easy.  discipline needs to consider who else is present.

parents with problem children would pay a lot for this system.  We can calculate market rates, what people can afford, and positive impact on the overall operation of the system - having extra pupils is good, for example.

Largely we'd just want to pay someone to make the meals and things.

integrate robots later, but having other kids around and watching everything closely with ai cameras seems ideal.
