the artifact protocol can be used to create registry services in the dreamcatcher network.

The napps registry is the same roughly as the stucks registry.

multiple registries can exist with different types of config and source nuances.

napp registries just store a repo, a commit, and a path.

feels like we need a way to deploy a repo with some napps installed by default ? like a bootloader, to make sure it is clean ? or, just have the napps being installed be able to do a sanity check.

stucks cannot be created with broader permissions than their repo allows.  same with napps.

napps can be published from any location in a repo, just like npm packages can be, but most likely it will be from the root of a dedicated branch.
