If we aquire companies with good recurring revenue, and we measure the engagement with customers, then we can remove the dev costs and increase the profit.

Then, list these companies on a pseudo stock exchange that we made.  Forecast based on diminishing returns as competitors catch up, but in the short time, take the cash gains and start paying dividends, which lets us sell the stock for higher.

Engagement measuring can tell us if we are undercharging for the product.
