So I think the trigger point for us is when we can have a system of being able to ingest or take on any new task as an AI-assisted task. So at that point, all of the administrative tasks that would typically just take hard labour or employees become a challenge to solve. Like, how can we do this using an AI system rapidly, and how can we get even better about it? Once we've done that, we can package up each problem we solve as a unique, dedicated solution for its specialised domain, which means that just the general side effect of our operations is product.
