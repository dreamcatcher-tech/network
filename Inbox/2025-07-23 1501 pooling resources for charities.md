if we could turn multiple charities into an uber style resource, where pariticpants can switch programs they can deliver, can save on travel time, and can utilize humans better.

Issue is that each new charity that springs up, they are always spread thin and always minimum wage.  Making it uberized might let people charge a better rate, since it unionizes all the charity workers, and makes them rapidly responsive as well as highly efficient due to low travel time.
