Can issue soulbound tokens, then wrap other ERC20 tokens, so that they can only transfer to other soulbound holders with the specified traits of the person who did the wrapping.

Cheap on gas soulbound transfers, where all the assets move with the token.

Can put some global flags, like approved contracts only, safety check on gateway, etc.

Means that we can publish contracts that aren't fully secure and then start using them, with safety on the exiting of funds.
