If you run a session as a child, then you can still type into it if it asks for some input ?
But if you ask to chat with something, it can drop you straight into it, as tho it was the new HAL.

The difference seems to be how you would expect to interact with the system in each case.

If we start by making versions that work for simple tasks, on a case by case basis, hopefully a more unified model will appear ?
