Could use cloudflares zero trust model to shield all devices from the internet ?

Means that so long as we have strict access controls on deno deploy, so that nothing but the cloudflare servers can access our site, then the customers private data should remain secure.

If we install the cloudflare agent on all the client machines, it can handle with security.

If we run chromebooks on the client site and manage them to ensure only certified apps can be installed, then we should be pretty safe.

Or just use android, and make it their problem if they download uncertified apps.
