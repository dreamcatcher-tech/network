if a widget wants to gain permission further than it currently has, it can ask the user to grant this permission and its execution will pause until a response is granted.  

it might optionally carry on without the permission, but ask out of convenience.

? can this be extended out to napps, so that while they're running they can request broader context access interactively with some part of the system ?

should be able to deny it, ask if unsure, and then it should be sticky or temporary.

show denials in the ui, so that user can go back to it, change the permission, and rerun it.

a permission is to ask if it can change the scope or list scopes too.
