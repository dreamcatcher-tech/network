we could use two nodes with two s3 accounts to get extra backup guarantees, and avoid a single one getting supressed.

It could be using different s3 suppliers too.

reach consensus between nodes that were set up in slow moving consensus, where it was more formal and low latency wasn't the matter.

So two nodes are set up with their own s3 accounts and their job is to upload data there and then also to check the other nodes uploads, on the theory that the chances of them both losing the data is very slim.
