If a prominent school principal quit his job so he could start a teacher training program that didn't go thru the universities, since the uni doesn't have incentive to change the curriculum for the benefit of the schools, then surely they would be interested in an AI based program to help train the teachers, but also to produce learning materials so the outcomes of education are far higher and more relevant.
