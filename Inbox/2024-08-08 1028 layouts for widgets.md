Side by side and up and down should be easy.

If we allow nesting, then we could experiment with allowing nested layouts too.

If I want to see two docs side by side, then I should be able to chat about that.

Ultimately a fine tuned model that knows how to interpret requests into layout commands would be needed.  Probably each special agent would load up some fine tuning of its own.
