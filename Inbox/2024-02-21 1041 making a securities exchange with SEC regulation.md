If we copied what fairmint is doing, and acquired someone with a license to manage equities, then we could present an equity management system that was regulated under the SEC and could have our AI agents giving advice on investments and enacting trades.

Fairmint is doing it badly in that they are not transparent or forthcoming as to how their systems work.  They have plans and aspirations, but their execution is going to be complicated.

If we could integrate with company registries, then we can enable transfers with compliance.

Why should doing a listing for one company be much harder than doing it for all companies ?  Like surely, since the regulation for the SEC is open ended, we could become an an agent, or pay an agent to take on some of the duties we need, and charge for the process using our systems ?

If AI is the admin destroyer, then compliance hurdles are the main place they should apply.

Then we should be able to map out all the path ways thru different compliance requirements, and keep having that added to as we progress.  Each chat and discussion, each piece of legal advice, should grow this intelligence.

Being able to have strong kyc guarantees between our participants enables faster collaboration.

In this way, we might start to look like a single large company / coop ?
Then, if you joined the coop, all SEC regulation is different.
Each member has strong identity, and all money is guaranteed clean.

If we had AI assistance with all compliance material, then we could offer faster turnaround and cheaper rates with higher quality.  We could offer continuous compliance, and let people chat with our tools to learn about their situation.  Then when you're ready, have a human to certify it, which goes into the bank of knowledge.  At the same time, pull in other public certifications so we have a growing body of knowledge around these things.

If we took upon ourselves the burden of auditing the companies using these ai tools, then we could obtain a transfer regulator license from the SEC to allow people to list very cheaply, then trade as tho they were public, continuously.
