GPT4 requires an external offchain call.

So, we can achieve consensus when multiple nodes make a gpt call with the same parameters, submit it, then everyone agrees that all the results are close enough.  A summary or a best one can be selected as part of these submission, and then thru this two step process, consensus is reached when the external call went to a blackbox api.

The apps we are pushing for in the pubco are ai dapps, but the dapp part is nearly insignificant now - its really just a trust layer so you can let the AI do work in yoru company and you remain in control - never before has so much power been unleashable upon your mutable and weak systems.  You need a strong system like blockchain to keep your records clean and consistent.  You need it open source and ai agnostic, so you can switch based on pricing.

Effectively the AI writes the dapps, and the dapp is presented using ai, so the human never sees the dapp.  the attribution is required to hold everything together under growth without falling apart.

Acquisition of companies seems best, rather than explaining what we're doing, but we need some initial SaaS offerings so we can hone our skills.  The dreamcatcher is our first app which helps with the specification of work, the publication of apps and incremental changes, and the usage of ai native apps that run on blockchain.

The public chain is required since there is a longing need for a contained system, free of openai.  We can provide the substrate upon which that competition can be run - a place for opensource AIs to be operated independently.  We can allow GPU trading, since these machines are expensive to run, and the price is formiddable.  This is the new crypto mining - gpu jobbing to run AI workloads publicly.  Even if you want private, you should use this format so you get supplier switchability.  We also cannot make our royalty payments at the micro level without a chain that supports this.

Basically an app store for nocode AI programmed apps, enabling anybody to make an app and publish it, but more importantly, enabling anybody to edit an app 

When the user becomes the programmer.  Consumer becomes the Creator.

Turns out the dreamcatcher is actually a no code app creator platform, with some basic features to start.  It was built upon itself, and can be improved using itself.  Even at launch, it should be significantly more efficient than the construction of traditional companies and software using the artisan methods of today.

The key to AI is giving it small tasks.  The key to our blockchain application architecture was very small pieces of code, plus process isolation.  This is a perfect fit for AI to be able to learn to program our chains with very small changes and thorough testing.  Our API was already in the perfect format for AI to call.

Merges can be AI controlled so that if some changes have occurred since, the AI can determine if they are meaningful or not.  Local AI checks when the merge is good to attempt from its perspective, then central / shared AI determines what can be backed up.

It seems we were just close enough to ideal programming that we slot in well with AI, since the simplification and isolation of programming is what AI needs to excel.
