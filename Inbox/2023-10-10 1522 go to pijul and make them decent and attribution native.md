If they could run natively on chain for us, and if their patches could be used directly in attribution calculations which made it cheaper and faster to generate attribution, this would be good for them, and as they grow their tiny user base, they grow ours too, and vice versa.

If we provided an AI first interface to the nest, and ran the nest in a way that it can be hosted by us too, then it might be more useful, rather than simply a web app that needs hosting, it becomes a bit more lively.

If our algos were used for communicating between client and server, we could score some extra brownie points ?

When running their nest software, the software for each repo should be running on pijul too.  The infrastructure should be based on pijul.  It should be portable to run your own server repo and also collaborate with others.  The server just acts like a long lived version of your local machine.

Executable pijul is what we are effectively supplying to them.
