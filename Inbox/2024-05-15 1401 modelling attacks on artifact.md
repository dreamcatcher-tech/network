If we have an NL description of how artifact works, we should be able to determine ways to attack it.

If someone theorizes an attack, we can play it out against our rules.

We can verify the outcome by concocting a scene with real code, and ensuring it runs how the simulation predicted.

Makes it easy to think about attacks, invite contributions without the high labour cost of demonstrating, and can run with real code to verify the attack is not possible.

Test for things like resource exhaustion by abusing free services like adding machine sessions.

Most attacks can be mitigated by making the users mine some bitcoin or something, which costs more than it makes them.

Types of attack should be well understood, like resource exhaustion, starvation of good actors, etc.
