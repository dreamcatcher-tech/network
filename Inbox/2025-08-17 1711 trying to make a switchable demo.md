I think so smax can see how it works and play with this discovery thing ?

should we try get ourselves inserted on an aggregator ?

measuring time to first correct tool call ?

guess the only way we'll know is to run evals, and try get it to do some tasks, and see what it got wrong ?

then get bots to twiddle with how to improve a given bots performance in selecting the right tools ?

or we could just make our own demo, with switchability anyway, and test out on that ?
