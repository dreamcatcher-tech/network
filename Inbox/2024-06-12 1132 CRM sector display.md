If we simply make a jitter that can display the sectors in the stateboard, and then answer questions about it, this is probably immediately useful ?

Do name change, color change, frequency change instructions.

Do on date calculations, holidays planning.

Stateboard is in modes for all runs, or specific dates, with a widget to move around directly.
