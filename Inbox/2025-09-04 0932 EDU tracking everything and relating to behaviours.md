if the person was doing really well, then we would try relate to environment, food, sleep - try find out what can recreate it.

then we can do targetted experiments to rule out certain factors, based on what we observed.

the continual experiment.
whether you aim to or not, you are running experiments constantly.

it might be completely random, but it might be something within our control.

it might also be something that we can predict, so we can signal when danger is approaching.
