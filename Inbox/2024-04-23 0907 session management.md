The engine would stay the same thruout.


We need to see when new branches have been created.
Pierce needs to watch everything in order, since this is one way to see new branches created.
Unless we notify of new branches separately - a DB function that watches the change of the head values.

Watch the head keys and send down notice when new branches are formed and deleted
Splice they could watch a glob patter for PIDs, or have a 'with children' flag so that child splices are sent down too ?
So if branches had glob patterns, then we would watch for keys that were children of this one.

If a fresh anonymous device turns up, how can it be granted some session activity before logging in ?

When a browser first comes in, create a temporary home chain based on the browser fingerprint.
If you then authenticate, any sessions you have created will be moved to your new authenticated chain.

When you delete your account, you are encouraged to push it all to a github repo as an export.

This home chain is where your analytics are kept.

The engine will start a default session, and will attempt to log in using existing credentials.

Anon session will make a dedicated request to get an anonymous PID.

What is a session a branch of ?
