if we pipe all our requests thru open router, then we can hit leaderboard with really about  a couple of hundred dollars worth of usage.

they can handle all our billing, and they give us access to a wide range of models for not much effort.

leaderboards is worth the marketing spend, since it gets us noticed.

we can pulse it as well as hit new models very early.

also run on new or niche models early, using evals, since we will catch the eye of other users, particularly early adopters.

people could use the openrouter key of their own choosing if they want, but they still have to pay us for their compute bill.

seems like for $200 gets you on the leaderboard for a lot of things.
