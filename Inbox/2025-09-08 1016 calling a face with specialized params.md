if we know more about the face, then we might be able to pass in more info ?

but is this info better passed in as preconfigured kinds, rather than something that is a variable ?

these are really just different prepackaged kinds, which is easier to choose between than getting parameters correct.

starting a face is really just the mcapp schema that is used to specify what it will look like ?
this can be used to spec the default, and if you want to patch any defaults, you just call those.

So the standard face calling method signature is the mcapp.
