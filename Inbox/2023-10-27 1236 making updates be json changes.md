If we do away with application logic, and make the updates be direct edits to something controlled by json schema, or do the state change checking inside the covenant, then we can dispense with the concept of actions coming in to an object ?

Means bulk changes are easier to perform.

The state replacement could be a system level action, rather than a user action ?

Some logic, even if just a schema, should be run to check it.
