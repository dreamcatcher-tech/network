Be able to cast intricate concrete forms by 3D printing the molds out of sand, and then be able to break them apart when done.

Print with sand and some binder to hold things together, then dissolve or crush the binder.

spray the faces with some kind of hardener.

Makes for digital formation of complex flowing shapes easy.

Each individual block can be stress tested and certified, and fitted with internal sensors.

Could also mill out the sand molds, which is easier again, since no nozzle or flow.  Some resin or something or binder, then we mill out the shape.
