we need to wrap this exe with some extra flags.

be able to point to a file to use as the sys prompt.

basically just point to the full config file, and you can edit that any way you like.

maybe pass in the sysprompt in the command line to be nice and quick.

So each config option, you can use a flag to set it.

so it can be easily overridden.
