If artifact runs server side in deno using esm as well, then we can avoid having a package json completely.  Then any app that wants to use our systems could run it using the url, or we could use esm as the bundler if we wanted a nodejs package.  But why not just use deno, anyway ?

Bundling sucks.

If we can import the files direct in the browser, why bundle at all ?

If deno fresh can be deployed to edge with no build step, then so much better than current pipeline, with bundler issues, import issues, and lack of pure source files.

Having debuggable files in the browser makes things much easier to work with, particularly since we are doing hard things in the browser.

Esm can bundle straight from github, so we might be able to bundle straight from artifact ?
We can bundle up isolates into github locations and then load these using esm to get them into the browsers ?  The hardly need to be dynamically changed in the browser.
