I wonder if we could make a tool or a strategy that would allow me to get taught something every day, like learning a branch of calculus or some other kind of statistical knowledge every day? I could get quizzes on it, I could learn how it works, how it relates, I could test my theories... then I could kind of learn things that were on the periphery of things that I'm currently interested in. It wouldn't be just a random stab; it'd be a slow, guided tour. The model can choose what I think would be best receptive to. They can give me these tiny little nuggets, so instead of spending a dedicated amount of time on it (like 4 years in uni), I could spend just a few years here and there. These little snippets could be gold towards something, could be just personal growth or my own metrics, but it could also be geared towards passing a certain exam, given that these exams are all available online and can be cloned and studied for.

It would be great to pick up some extra skills, like quick probability checks and other such things, to use in daily life. I don't feel like I use maths enough. 

Beats doom scrolling.

Can interlace some daily news that is interesting.

Could be assembled and generated from nuggets that humans have created.
