giving a bot the power to retract what it said and say something different.

So the human can queue up several prompts, and then at the end the bot may decide it needs to re-edit.

also can have other bots come in an clean up the response, so it gets layered, cleansed, rechecked - might get reran in the background if enough errors.

might have been run 10 times in the background anyway, and a winner selection shows it to you.
