Make it develop theories and then go about testing those theories.
Come up with ideas for solutions, then test them all.
Continually develop insights and knowledge shortcuts that it has tested fully, partially, or not at all.
Keep working thru them all until a good fix is found.

This is the difference between teaching how to do something vs llm training on knowledge.  These steps are not documented anywhere, but they are done by all developers when they navigate code.
They jump around and build up a mental map of things.  They run the debugger with different values and look for counter examples.

We should use this to build of a knowledge base of the code, and then we should compare this conceptually to the code itself.  This should result in deep understanding being exposed and the humans getting surprisingly good answers all the time.
