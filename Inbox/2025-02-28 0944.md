How much of the napp processing interface is being leaned on for the action processing framework ?

Do the napp definitions allow a nested napp definition ?

Fundamentally, the sniffing of items to recover type safety is unavoidable.

We should tuck these away in their own function module, like the napp tools, and then know that we have a clean interface in front of the callers

1. Parse the napp json to define the schema of the napp interface, which should be standard across languages.
2. provide an action creator that makes napp actions when the functions that the napp interface defines / creates 
3. take in a json object that is untyped



Given a napp definition object, which would be a zod schema, and would be flat for the names of functions, 

Nesting napps within each other seems pointless, they should be flat in the namespace ?

First, drop the nesting, since this causes huge problems.  Either split the napp namespace out or do something like that.

I will make a router object that holds all the internal methods and flattens the namespace of each one.

Basically, in a napp, there is a mod.ts file that is expected

! use the path param in the napp tool spec, so we can repoint different functions in the same flat space ?
