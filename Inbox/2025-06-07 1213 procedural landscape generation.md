The difference between a game editor and gameplay seems to be shrinking, or at least it should be. The reason why an editor isn't a game yet is because of the friction of the interface. Now, using an AI chatbot to help you, as well as it being able to generate very small in-game UI's like levers, dials, to interpret gestures like a paintbrush, you should be able to, without not too much effort, turn the editor into an actual game or control it from within the game. The AI bot would take care of the complexities that the editor used to require for you to express your desires and it can also be a translator or dumb-it-down version plus you can use it for help and other such things. So you should be able to make these worlds or widgets and all kinds of interesting things. 

Then you go and share them with your friends and other people. We could have special areas for building different things, like a workshop that was specifically made for building, say, guns or other things like that, would have a range of different 3D tools that you could apply to give a certain effect or add a certain item. So you can actually assemble the thing possibly with some additional constraints in the world. Like if the world had rules on maximum force and things like that, then the workshop would be set up to only allow you to build things that were within reason or something like that.

But basically we want to turn the process of editing and creating game assets into something that occurs in-game and is kind of an interesting gamified thing itself. Plus you could even change it using chat. Make new tools using chat, make new tools using the tools plus the chat, and then immediately use those tools inside of the game. Everything would be signed and carry authenticity and provenance tracing, and people could build on what you made because we'd build a component tree that represented the discrete steps you took, possibly with the seed of the prompts where the seed is a reduced down version of AI prompt that would cause something equivalent to be generated.
