A crypto exchange that starts as a bank first would survive the downturns much better, and would never have regulation problems.

It should include wrappers around assets to ensure clawback within some period, so funds don't just simply disappear.  So they have a cooldown period during which the assets can be retrieved.

Means we have strong online identity.
