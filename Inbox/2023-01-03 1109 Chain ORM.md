If each chain represents an object in a program, then a system that mapped those chains into classes should be more convenient to work with.

If an app could be made by constructing classes then processing them into a set of covenants, maybe this is an easier model to develop with ?

Ideally, dev logic goes into these classes, and so a frontend app can use the classes synchronously in React and it is the exact same logic code as the backend is using when it runs chains.

Function calls in the classes are wrapped with dispatch in the front end.

Allow the class structure to operate in eager pre-render mode, where changes are calculated synchronously and returned as how they are expected to be, then the app works in the background to get them actually merged in to the main branch.
