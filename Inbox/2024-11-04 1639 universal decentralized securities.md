By making the completion of work being a decentralized, AI run, disinterested thing, this further removes the managerial work.

This alone is super useful.  Like upwork but we provide a checking system that verifies the quality using QA.  Can plug in to all the upcoming platforms that offer PR reviews.

So the payouts are done using a decentralized system, that is not subject to distortion.

Maybe some short framework to do genuine securities, like developing a piece of land, and taking on development for that.

Things you cannot use elsewhere can never be decentralized income streams.

But technology should be, by default, a decentralized stream.

Ventures that set up as a decentralized work quality appraiser.  Once we know what the threashold for decentralized is, these companies can set up and do this work and prove they are disinterested.

The market need is for a way to have genuine decentralized profits, so small ventures can be exempt from securities laws.  This will include AI based restrictions on what everyone who is involved is saying to the public.
