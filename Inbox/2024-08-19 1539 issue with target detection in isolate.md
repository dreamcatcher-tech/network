if the isolate figures out where the target is based on the actor branch, then it cannot be easily mocked, since we have to mock the whole actor setup, so it always finds its way around correctly.

It could be set to target either in branch, or a completely remote repo, so each test controller generates a whole repo for it to test against ?
