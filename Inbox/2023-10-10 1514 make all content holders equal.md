We could demarc the funds split separately from the ability to trade your contribution.

Everyone gets 100 shares to trade for their contribution.

Could be confusing tho

The funds split isn't necessarily how the royalty splits will go, since that is based on usage.

? How to map the committers to the addresses, and how to keep contributor assets in safeguard until they claim it ? [[2023-10-10 1519 service to hold an eth address in escrow]]
