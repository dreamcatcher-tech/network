For something like tax optimization, we would have a backing model that is basically this amount of money moved to this location with this loss.

Then we go thru and score all the ways we can do that, including payments over time, multiple channels, channel size.

So if we model it like a transmission network, and the goal is to minimize loss and the cost and time of setting up the network and maintaining it, then we can find the optimum transmission pattern.

This is a case where a structured model will be far better answers, and bots can grind in parallel to score better against the standard dashboard.

Where else can this model apply ?
