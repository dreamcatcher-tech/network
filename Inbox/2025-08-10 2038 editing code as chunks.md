instead of asking the model to make diffs AND also solve the problem, we should extract out the piece of problem code, and then focus in just on that, so that all the model has to do is fix that specific piece.

The chunking and insertion should be handled by a serparate model / tool combo, where running linters and prettier is all part of the polish part.
