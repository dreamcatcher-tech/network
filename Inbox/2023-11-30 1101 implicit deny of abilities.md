Define a list of user stories that HAL is allowed to do.  Use retrieval to keep the filesize down.  Use the list as the means of generating tests.

Only allow features that  are in the set of tests.

Record new requests for functions if someone asked for something out of scope - help the user describe what they wanted to happen as a story.
