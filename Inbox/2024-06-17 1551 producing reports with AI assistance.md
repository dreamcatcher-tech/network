When we have a jumble of facts to present, generating a helpful report is hard to do and time consuming.  If it could be done by a bot, and if the bot could go with the doc so that could answer questions as we go along, then the process of generating a doc that hits the mark with the consumers is greatly reduced.

The documents making claims would point at the fact atoms and the staked assertions of each one.  Any claims would be pointed at facts, and anything not verifiable would be flagged.  This would be a good way to write wikipedia articles.

Each comment should be assignd and agent which drives the completion of the question.  Other humans can get involved with this process too.
