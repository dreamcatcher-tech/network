Should tie back to user requests, funds, timelines.
Say how long the feature took, how much revenue is projected to flow thru it, 
Notify everyone who subscribed to it, or whose interaction path is affected by it.
Devs need only update the storybook component that can navigate to a place that displays the new feature.

By making the company internal incentives transparent and visible to all, disjoint workers can compete to make the most high value products.

Basic synth is just our own user stories, and asking for a set of inputs that start how we would expect.
Then combine the synths for each feature, so the synth generates random compound paths.
Then some way to appraise if the outcome was correct.
