Monitor AWS, and see where you can either use some more CPU, or any other resource, like ram providing a nice snappy ram cache, or some transmission.

Basically the servers should be running 24/7.

If you're always getting paid more, then you should use it. 

Basically if we're monetizing something you would make no money from, then that is a win.
