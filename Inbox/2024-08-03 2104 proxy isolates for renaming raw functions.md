If we made a tool that can reprompt the underlying isolates, so that they can be described in better ways, that suit prompting better, yet under the hood they just call an existing isolate.

These should be able to be improved by the testing cycle.

Writing them in a dedicated way makes them more obvious to call in the calling bot, as they are technically part of the prompt.
