Some data, like youtube videos that we have the rights to, can be difficult to pull down from their respective sites.

So if we used the platform, then given a specific url, like a youtube link, and a given purpose, as in download the highest quality audio, then our whole network should act as one.

If this download has occured before, then it would serve back the cached version.

Same with api requests for transcription - if the same file with the same params has been called before, and the api has been flagged as repeatable, then it returns the cached result.

The person who made the first full call should get paid some fraction of what the call would have cost, since its cheaper for the second called, and compensates the first.

It can also be flagged as repeatable with conditions, like if the api endpoint model for transcription remains the same, then we should expect the same output.

We could force a redial, but often that is not needed.

Can be used for torrents, where if we already have the file, you can just pay the person who uploaded it a small fee which is cheaper than all the resources you would expend downloading it again.
