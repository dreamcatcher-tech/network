We can have all our functions running inside deno deploy, so long as any given repo can be downloaded and replayed, with proofs of which remote repos communicated with this one.

Here is where crypto checking is required.

From here, we can expand out to two different installations of deno deploy.

Then finally out to distributed offline versions of deno deploy - they give us the ideal computing interface to strive for.
