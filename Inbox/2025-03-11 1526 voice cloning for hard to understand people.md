If we use the voice cloning to allow for you to present better in meetings if you have a bad accent. 

This system can also help you with your accent by detecting areas of difference where the cloning had to pick up and change. You can try to steer towards it, and we can give you visual feedback on it over time. 

You can turn this on for people in a meeting, so that when their voice is coming in you can receive a cloned version. This can help with harsh accents, difficult-to-understand people, or just generally make a voice sound less annoying.
