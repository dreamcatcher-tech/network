If something needs its reasoning effort turned up, then it shouldn't be allowed to call the tool directly, but rather it would call the assistant that could do that for it.

Perhaps assistants could pass back frames to each other that are populated or something ?

assistant orchestrators, where you have a list of assistants, and then you can group them under a router, which means you can chat with them directly, but also via the router.  Seeing their chats, you see which ones are handed off too, or ones that were direct.
