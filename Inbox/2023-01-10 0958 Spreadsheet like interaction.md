Sometimes customer lists need bulk actions done, or a special kind of view made.
If the main list was in fact an excel spreadsheet using [sheetjs](https://docs.sheetjs.com/docs/demos/frontend/react) then we could give users more ability to slice and view their data, as well as make pipelines that can bulk edit customers.

Multi stage search filters could be arranged to have one list output into the next column.

Preview mode lets you sample the results before commiting.
Chains allow atomically changing everything all at once.
