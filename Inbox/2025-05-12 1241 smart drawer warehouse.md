If a dark warehouse with a standard unit of storage was deployed in a location and the ability to rapidly deliver these items to and from homes in the area was created, then we can treat this area like a shopping mall and sell space to participant retailers.

Some retailers might be food, some might be groceries, we could sell space in this warehouse and pick-in capacity so that they could be tenants of the system and we fill out this queue. With rented space that people pay to be a part of, these brands can then service this local area using this white-label transport system.

As we sign up each individual house, they are also able to shop from the other services that we supply. Some of them can be permanent storage, some of them can be any of the shops that you might see in a typical town center that people would consume locally. Cloud kitchen could be there because that would be like delivery plus some processing, so Cloud kitchen would have say some chefs but they would also use the Draw system as their storage, their kitchen, they would receive replen straight in there. 

And then, as we have a couple of these around (or even just one), we can have these strong, direct connections with suppliers like BidFood or other suppliers that would typically send in their own truck. We can haul in this stuff and sort of "infect" the supply chain. Where we say, "Well, maybe you should use our facility," and we can just buy direct to these end customers for you. Or, here's our truck support system: we'll come and collect from you, just load it up in these containers. We will reduce the price and increase the reliability.
