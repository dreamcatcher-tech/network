If we can set some eval parameters, then we would run the code, eval the output using a model to look at it, give feedback, iterate on the code.

the loops should be easily viewable, but they are going to be dumped eventually, since they are transient.

Being able to visually grasp these loops, steer them, interact with them, restart them, all whilst using the latest code or any version thereof, this is useful.

Linter errors is an important change here, but more meaningful 

architectural changes - system should always be reassessing if an architectural change would perform better.  Go down multiple parallel development paths testing different assumptions, so you know the solution space was properly explored.

Should be able to set its own evals, or ask for a change on some given evals.
