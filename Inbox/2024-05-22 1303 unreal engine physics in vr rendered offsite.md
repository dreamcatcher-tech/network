In cloud, we can render heavy effects them stream them down to the VR headset, so the user doesn't need hefty GPU.

It may be slow, or degraded polygons, but at least it will eventually settle on the high quality version.

In world building, users tolerate a low grade during generation, so if you could go paint a room and have it eventually stabilize, this would be grand.

Use LLMs to give users what they want, show examples, and help guide them to making their own world that they call home.
