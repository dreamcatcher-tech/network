If we can train an LLM on natural data, then we can get certified by some local bodies as being accurate as reflecting the voice of a particular resource.  Worldwide indigineous peoples are generally in charge of resources, so we can get them to interrogate and accept these models as the voice they get behind.

Can make negotiations for use of these resources more automated, as many different competing requirements can all interrogate the model before taking anyones time.
