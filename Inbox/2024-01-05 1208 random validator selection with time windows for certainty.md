By setting the randomization, we can say at a certain time that enough opportunity for rebuttal has occured, and enough randomness has occured that your transaction is diversely verified.

In our system you can receive streaming updates for how secure your transaction is.  We can asses the value of the tx for you, and give an indication

Stake can be held in an eth account with a set of signatures that are shared by a validator.

So, we can use our system to provide signatures for transactions that can be verified in ethereum.  Then we set the validator stakes to be in pools, and split between multiple pools.

Without an intrinsic asset, we cannot make clean internal systems that depend on things like this.

We could start skimming transactions and have a market for our internal currency so that our system has some internal weight behind its actions, rather than relying on externally staked resources for something vital.  Could stake the NFTs that were used in its construction, where we have appraisal methods for these NFTs.

SO YOU CAN BUY AND TRADE THE CORE NFTS THAT ARE USED IN THE VALIDATION PROCESS
This would behave like a currency, and to acquire some you have to trade somehow to get it.  We know which NFTs are valid as stakes since they are calculated by the attribution forecast of the next commit.

Then, of all the transactions, some reasonable cut is taken and paid out to the validators.

Our internal currency then, is these NFTs.

Inbound bridges can handle ETH and other currencies, using multisig transactions, but this is no longer a core problem, and can be selected based on price and preference.  We should be able to have some vaulting systems holding pure silver on behalf, too.
