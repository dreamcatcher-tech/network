Different ways to come up with pipelines and strategies for knowledge processing need to be automated.

We should be able to be guided in the setup of workflows, the generation of options, and then be able to evaluate them without writing code, so we know which ones are promising in terms of final outputs of the LLM.

Ultimate is dynamic workflows tat use the reasoning to figure out a new workflow on the fly.

Then at each node, we can start to generate the code that would run it.
