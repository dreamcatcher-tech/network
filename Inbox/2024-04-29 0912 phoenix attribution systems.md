If we come up with a standard playbook of how to license dead startup info, like their emails, internal files, customer relationships, cap tables, then this can be applied to many different places.

We could go to Interbit and gain access to all the past materials and thinking, with an attribution system in place, to avoid having up front charges.

Can also trace employee HR records, salaray payments, and other items, to provide post mortem diagnostics for attribution.  Also can indicate forcings causing collapse or less than ideal performance.

These systems should be run on live companies, with the benefit of the collapse information being available to guide the current live versions to not die the same way.  A small royalty is paid to the dead companies for the lesson they shared.
