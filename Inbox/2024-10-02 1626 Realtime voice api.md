We should make the real-time audio stream be programmable, so that using AI tooling elsewhere in the platform, the configuration parameters for the real-time API can be adjusted and tweaked and tuned, so that experiments can be done without requiring any kind of programmatic changes. 

This can also allow us to create large-scale synthetic tests of the audio API to see what type of responses we're getting, and to appraise the audio content of the generation being used as input to another model.
