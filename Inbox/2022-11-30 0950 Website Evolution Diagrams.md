> The more I look at the various pieces, the more I want diagrams (that flow) rather than words. Building from the fundamental idea, to the technical solution, to the next problem that was encountered. I believe you have to take people along a brief train journey of what has clearly taken you years to realize.

We could show the construction of each piece, what demand we thought we were satisfying, and what led to failure.

Use the DRE modelling language to describe the DRE itself in the different states of its evolution, showing why each part failed, and what the solution was.

Show how the current cluster of components came to be believed in, and what problems the cluster solves, for its own self and for others.

Ultimately show how the system models itself, and assesses itself and its performance towards its goals.

Show the model of the company structure, and forecast revenue dispersals at each point.  Also things like growth prospects, difficulty in staff joining, induction path for new ideas.

Progression of the realization as to how far reaching blockchain can be.  Describe pure offline companies, then show orgs with the capital rewards tied into the software structure, enabling distributed change rather than central corporate control - a scale invariant company.

How to capture innovation, how to reward it, the meeting of Xinova, our reaction and restructuring of that.  The description of the fundamental problem of how to value human contribution compared with resources, and with different types of human contribution.  Then extend to what price should something be.  These are country foundational type of problems.

Show how problems like project management, reporting, fundraising - these are all general problems that are shared by everyone.

Ultimately the packetization of work offers a solution to all these problems.

Model the pool of all ideas, vs the pool that we have access to, and show how it was weak when compared to the dreamcatcher being operated within the dreamcatcher.  Use our own tools to model how we used to be.  Express our company goals as formulas - measurements of a state model that we want to see.

Use the [models of concurrency](https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter2/#The-Dynamic-Discovery-Problem) to describe workers and the power of their 'company' as a distributed system that attempts to process and burst and do so cheaply and quickly.  Highlight how discovery is a problem that takes time and results in poor matches.  Show how even basic modifications to the traditional company aspects can offer performance improvements.  Can frame the problem as a messaging problem.

## Example
### Make a blockchain

### Make an app company
Needed to encourage external development of apps, rather than it being all in house.  Also fix the capital structure of the existing company.
