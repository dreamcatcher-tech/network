Show when Ted talks about a new term, and link back to the youtube clip segment which the dictionary definition is derived from, then show when it is used thruout, and show where it should be used since the human is talking about things that sound similar.

If the state is made to hold links back to prior state, then this is better than autodetected diffs.
The state would have a link back to parts of the prior state, so things like threads can be handled efficiently.

Particularly if there is some transform that was applied to the past text, so we can preserve the lineage.

Binary files should be able to handle this too.

We can generate transclusion using git blame.  Use AI to determine the chunk size, then be able to navigate back to the different revisions that contributed to the current one, plus show external links to other projects that use code that is similar.

Indicate strength of connection using color temperature.
