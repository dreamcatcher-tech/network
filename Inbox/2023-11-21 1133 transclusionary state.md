Show when Ted talks about a new term, and link back to the youtube clip segment which the dictionary definition is derived from, then show when it is used thruout, and show where it should be used since the human is talking about things that sound similar.

If the state is made to hold links back to prior state, then this is better than autodetected diffs.
The state would have a link back to parts of the prior state, so things like threads can be handled efficiently.

Particularly if there is some transform that was applied to the past text, so we can preserve the lineage.

Binacry files should be able to handle this too.
