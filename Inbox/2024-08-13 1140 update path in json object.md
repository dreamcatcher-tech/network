Allow the bot some space to do reasoning, and to ponder before defining a step by step approach ending with a result.

Use a path update call to allow it to edit a json object using a definite path so the update is surgical.  The schema of the path would be extracted mechanically from the schema.

So each json object should have a schema stored with it, so the bot always knows the structure it must conform to, and what is the reasoning for that structure.
