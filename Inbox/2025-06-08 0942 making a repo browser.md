If we can make the basic repo browser, then we can see inside the system, and can build from there.

The goal / milestone next is to be able to vibe code frames on our own platform.

This should be done by making the static files render as blob urls.
So the platform makes file changes, and they render without requiring any dev server or hmr, as we just rebuild the project.

Also vibe code napps.
