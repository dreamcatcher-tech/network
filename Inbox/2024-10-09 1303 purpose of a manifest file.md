Basically to provide a standard way of locating all the key parts we need to use it as a package, but allows the freedom inside the package to do anything you want.

So the package can be treated as a unit, but inside people are free to do anything they want.

We add things like history being git incorporated, and executions also being included as part of the file.

package.json includes space for man pages, so this could be where we advertise our ERD so he language of the package is exported.  https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/configuring-npm/package-json#man

Would specify the version of artifact that we need to run on.
