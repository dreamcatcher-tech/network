If we present the markdown editor in the stateboard, then saving the file, or hitting the save button should go via the prompt, rather than operating on the filesystem directly.
If all changes go via the prompt, then the AI can check what is happening and do triggered workflows.

Or we could put triggers against files, but it seems better to use the prompt to save.

Can adorn it with AI calls that are not blockchained, to do things like spellcheck, check the format of yaml and propose changes.
