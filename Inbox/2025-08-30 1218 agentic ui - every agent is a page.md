can we have subpages within that ?

this is the 'face' of the agent.

that 'page' is visible to anyone who can see the agent.

the agent can produce other pagets, but that would need some query params to access.

if you connect to the root page, it always creates a new session just for you, with session id in url params, but if you share that you can see the same thing.

The agent has the same config each time, and so the session starts with the same state.

so if an agent is just a container, it isn't that special that it has ai in it, as this is just another program, so the agent boot and everything is still the same, and same with the session management.
