Now that each repo has a unique repoId, and since parent child relationship is stored in config files, what does rm mean ?

Where should an RM request be sent to ?

How does clone work ?

Should not be a central chain that gets messaged, but rather a special coded PID that calls the system host.

When should it be done ? just like executing any serial request, or in band ?

Should be like any other request, but when the transmission system encounters the system action, it is not in fact transmitted, but executed ?

Or, if it did in fact go into a dedicated chain, like perhaps the actors home chain, then repo management could occur ?

A request to self with a special isolate that triggers the system to run.

The null isolate, which calls very specific functions which are predefined.

Or it could be a genuine isolate, that just gets loaded with the context when it gets seen.

? Where do permissions get checked ?
Inside the special isolate ?
