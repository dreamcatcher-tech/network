Make a tool that operates on installers with covernant trees that makes sure the descriptions in the apis and states down low are expressed accurately up the top, to provide advertising to HAL as he is browsing around for solutions.

These suggestions could be part of normal HAL operations, as the context HAL is in gives a good footing for making suggestions that could have made things better, and so the system is continually being tweaked by the LLM output with a slightly different context each time.
