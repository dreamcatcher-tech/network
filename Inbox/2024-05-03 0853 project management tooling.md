Scheduling, as A3D showed us, can result in significant savings for people.

Using language models to make decisions on projects, draft chase up emails, integrate various data points, including things like weather, mine for patterns - this can make a common person an expert at project management.

It can teach them about project management as they go along.

Can lead to the ultimate state of having an elastic workforce that is paid per task.

We should go and see how we can make an A3D based app for whole team project management.

Attribution calculations are important here, as we can generate this info, which can be used as a guide for payment, not necessarily as the payment itself.  From there, we can advise on pay rates in the marketplace, and score peoples contributions, so their reputation carries forwards.  We don't need to handle the money to have ambient attribution be highly valuable.
