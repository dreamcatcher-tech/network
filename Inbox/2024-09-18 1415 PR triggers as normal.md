PR triggers as the normal way of moving data. So when a user attempts to save data back to the main branch. There should be a series of checks that kick off that can assure the quality of the changes. Like a pull request, but There may also be a range of other triggers for services like emails, or billing or some other kinds of processes that will need to be done, but only in that main branch.
