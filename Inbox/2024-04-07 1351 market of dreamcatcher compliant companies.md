If we start a grid of companies that are dreamcatcher native, then we can allow people to favour them.

Anyone can include other companies too, but dreamcatcher companies let you own some, work for some, and see inside and know that you money is going somewhere fair, no matter how it is.

Have an honest comparison of services with other closed competitors, and have models of the competitors, so we can all simulate how we will replace them to get cheaper goods, higher quality, with open knowledge, and greater reach as it can get into remote locations.

People can figure out how to bring these fancy goods and services to their local areas with modifications made to suit.
