the repo can present a facade that is itself a napp that presents all the napps it has installed as a single napp with some arbitrary rewrites.

so it can in effect be customized.

this napp can be extracted and stored, as well as the repo that comes with it, to give it some kind of base install.

napps have to include files in them too, and they might include a full repo so they have history, rather than representing a single snapshot.
