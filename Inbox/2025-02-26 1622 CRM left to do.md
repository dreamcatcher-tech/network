If we convert to an action creating version of the provider, and then use this all the time anyway, then once we are happy with this, we can then build the cloud server.

Then we have cloud operations.

Then we make a thin client that runs in the browser and connects up to the cloud installation.

Then, we show the customer browser interface like we have created already.
Then we add in the bits to do mapping.

Users need to be identified by who they sign in as ?
