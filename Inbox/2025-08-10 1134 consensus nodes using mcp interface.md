if each node has an mcp connection to the other nodes in the consensus group, then this means that potentially an LLM could be managing the nodes behaviours ?

This might be useful in simulators, where the LLM is told to behave in a byzantine way.

having an mcp interface might make it simpler since all comms are dont using this protocol.
