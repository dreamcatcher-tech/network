Bet against a certain size of the item, and get paid when you are accurate.
Proposer of the task puts a small sum that is won by the correct appraisers.
The appraisers ask questions to refine the task, since their bets being accurate are important, and they get paid in contribution to refine the task.

This can be a way of accepting bids from devs, where they say how long it will take them, or anyone, and if they're right, then they get the prize plus the reputation.
