If the platform usage was pure cost basis, which aims to be a loss leader, then we should make money from transactions in the marketplace, since we are facilitating trade with services.

So people come because we have good intelligence tools and a marketplace to coordinate many different skills together optimally.  Displaces competition since cheaper and better.

The future is AI walls going up on peoples emails.

Let devs build new tools that are pluggable.

? How could this be presented in some kind of md powerpoint thing ?
Make a list of the features required, like stripe, email, accounts, etc and see what the overlap is.

like an assasination map in a murder plot, but in reverse, to find out how to reach certain people.

What is the definition of online ?

Every venture would need this outreach option.
Network members would be fortified against traditional outreach, as HAL processes all incoming info for relevance.  We would require incoming to pay the AI fees to read their message.

So if we made these tools internally, they could be good for every one of our users.

Biggest winner would be if we could get contacts to do the promotion for us, like a commssion for introducing people you know, turning everyone into a marketer, and pushing the reqards out to the edges of the network.  Offer commision for referrals of any kind.

Try and get recipients to join the platform, so they can configure their options for notifications to be parsed by bots.  Plus they can configure an email address so they can receive email and run the same AI parsing on it, so they likely get a lot of spam, and we can be their mailbox.

Even discovering who to talk to in your own org is important.
If all org members had incentive to bring in new business and got a cut of it, then the org would induct at max rate - currently no incentive for people to handle business unrelated to their job, since that would require extra effort without extra reward, and worse they might get punished for it since they might fall behind on some other stuff.
