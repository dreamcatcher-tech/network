If the platform usage was pure cost basis, which aims to be a loss leader, then we should make money from transactions in the marketplace, since we are facilitating trade with services.

So people come because we have good intelligence tools and a marketplace to coordinate many different skills together optimally.  Displaces competition since cheaper and better.

The future is AI walls going up on peoples emails.

Let devs build new tools that are pluggable.

? How could this be presented in some kind of md powerpoint thing ?
Make a list of the features required, like stripe, email, accounts, etc and see what the overlap is.

like an assasination map in a murder plot, but in reverse, to find out how to reach certain people.

What is the definition of online ?

Every venture would need this outreach option.
Network members would be fortified against traditional outreach, as HAL processes all incoming info for relevance.  We would require incoming to pay the AI fees to read their message.

So if we made these tools internally, they could be good for every one of our users.

Biggest winner would be if we could get contacts to do the promotion for us, like a commission for introducing people you know, turning everyone into a marketer, and pushing the rewards out to the edges of the network.  Offer commission for referrals of any kind.

Try and get recipients to join the platform, so they can configure their options for notifications to be parsed by bots.  Plus they can configure an email address so they can receive email and run the same AI parsing on it, so they likely get a lot of spam, and we can be their mailbox.

Even discovering who to talk to in your own org is important.
If all org members had incentive to bring in new business and got a cut of it, then the org would induct at max rate - currently no incentive for people to handle business unrelated to their job, since that would require extra effort without extra reward, and worse they might get punished for it since they might fall behind on some other stuff.

recipients come back to the platform to manage their status.
If we had a piece at the bottom that let people come back to our platform and manage their own preferences, then we can let them block from the whole platform, or manage all their spam using our service, or only get contacted about very specific things.

Show how we modelled the user and tried to take care of them.  Show how we learned from their interactions with others, and what we say from platforms like instagram and others so they can see their profile as marketers see it.  They can set if they're interested in offers or other things.  

They are presented with value if they pass on the message or provide leads to others.  If they give us their contact list, we can pay them each time those contacts are used, and pay each time an engagement that leads to a sale occurs.  We can draft for them a personal endorsement that they can send on to their contacts, and they will earn money from it, particularly if the person buys or engages.

We can provide tools to assess offers and ask questions - this feeds back to the promoters to show what people are worried about.  AI generated survey results where it fills in the survey based on raw natural language interaction processing.

The app for MC is really about filling in a complicated form.  This form filling in the background is a recurring feature.  It should always recall the users prior answers and be able to fill in pre-emptively.

We would manage billing in dreamcatcher.

We would sell weapons to both sides - recipients can load up their emails on our platform to manage all their email flows using AI, and senders could do the same.  If there is overlap, they would cooperate.

Services marketplace with commissions paid out to everyone who contributed.
Fair pricing estimation tooling to both sides can negotiate fairly.

Outreach should be much friendlier and coordinated between all parties - all the outreachers and all the recipients.  We should also get an affiliate cut of the products that are sold.  The products should be assessed by our systems as being good, ethical products too, so there is AI confirmed quality the whole system thru.

If we made marketing tools first, then they can spread us farther than any other type of consumer.  If we are offering a different paradigm that empowers recipients as well as marketers, and our base has more tooling abilities than the competition, this should attract large numbers of marketing professionals.  Some of them will understand our economic offering, and turn their hand to helping us.  Using our own tools, they will be more effective than if we didn't have these tools.
