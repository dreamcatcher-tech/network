represent the items as objects with different probabiltiies of being there, different abilities to move in different areas and directions.  The simulation helps set the weights of all of these, and describe scenarios, and then play with each one.

This higher level language is then exercised by an LLM, which is used to train a specialized AI that gets a feel for how the rules of the system work, to accelerate the process of determining what is most likely to happen.

This AI would be like an AI in that it has probabilities for the next token to be output, but its language is that of the battlefield model.  Can be trained on specific pieces of terrain, or on general terrain and then tuned up as the need arises on a specific area.

Can be used for project management, where the language of project management is used to train an LLM, and this is what gives the advice on the system.  The LLMs build a set of rules that get verified, and then provide exercised load on the system.  Plus they can map existing projects into the standard project language, so we can get real data inserted.

Can we map a CERN project based on emails into dreamcatcher packets with varying parameters ?
Packet model configured with limited broadcast ranges, and privacy controls.

We could run this thing over a company's email server and do the same thing for their internal processes and workflows.
