Use [[Location NFTs]] to provide incentives for children to turn up at school on time.
The childs phone can only mint one at a certain place at a certain time.
Show how many they can have and do have in a single screen to give them a view of history.
Incentives along the way, and at the end.
Team games, where if them and their friends all mint over time, they all get a reward - used to make them all encourage and help each other to be in attendance.

Can mint based on coming from the schools ip address, or having some wifi in range.

App can know when the child is likely to fail to mint for the day and can signal to other teammates that they are going to miss it.

Parents can sign off on a sick day.

When they accumulate enough, can trade them for other privileges.
Can be used for wifi access or other services, like a phone plan.

Connect to a phone plan provider so that the performance can be controlled by the parents, or made contigent on accumulation of NFTs that the parents set as the goals for the child.  Then the system is mechnical, and not subject to debate, so the parent does not need to go thru the awkward part of also being the enforcer.

Net can be safety controlled using the data card, also calling numbers are screened.
