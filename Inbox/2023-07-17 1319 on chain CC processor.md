Provide a way to do decentralized CC payments.
User encrypts their CC details into their wallet.
Processors can ask the user to decrypt so they can access it.
Also users can sign messages allowing a CC to be used by a merchant - means the CC details can be kept separate from the merchant, and only the trusted processor can see the CC.

Means devs can make apps that do not require a backend to do CC processing.
If an app has no actual backend, surely it is decentralized then.

Truly decentralized apps have no backend - very few apps meet that bar, however all apps should.
