the root of the agent page is just the bios.

the bios is there just to make sure the machine is on.

agents need to be started.

In the begining, there is only the bios, and all agents are dark.

if a new request comes in:
1. if the computer is configured to serve, it will start up a new agent for each new request that arrives.
2. if it just lists available agents, then you pick on ?
3. there might be an agent set up to be at the "/" which is the one you talk to ?
