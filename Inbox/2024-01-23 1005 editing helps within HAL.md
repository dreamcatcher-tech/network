If the helps are pushed to a separate repo, and if within HAL we have the power to edit them and push back to the master branch, then I think we are actually operating.

Certainly if the stucks can be public, then we are starting to truly operate.  At least with both SM and I working, we would make more progress faster, as a team, and could add other people along too.

Overlay each others views as well, so we can see what other people have been working on or changing.

Be able to splice pieces of a session and store it in the testing structure.  By pulling in a reference to the commit we can always have access to the deeper context of the session.  Then we can cause an auto test to run the request again each time something changed.  Splicing should be a bot we tune so we can snip some pieces off and use in the test environment.

Then start editing the isolate code files inside of HAL using some other tooling, which is when things start really cooking.
