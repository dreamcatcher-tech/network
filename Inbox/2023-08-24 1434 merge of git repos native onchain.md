running a git repo on chain seems an easy and useful first app, where the merge of prs is triggered by packet acceptance, making a git repo truly decentralized.

We can provide hosting for these services so they are always online, even tho we cannot control them.

Offer private repos for a fee.  NFT the tasks to build out feature parity with the others.

Each commit could become a tradeable nft and be a royalty target.
