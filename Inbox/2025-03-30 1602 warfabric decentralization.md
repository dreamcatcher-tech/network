We need a model that pushes the management of each repo out to the edges.

It should still be available to the higher ups, but just by way of agents.  Agents should really run the systems, and they control and decide who can enter or not.  Basically all parties should think all other parties are corrupted and might disappear at any moment, so all should store synced copies of whatever they're working on.

If they want funding access, then they would have to install a certain amount of control ?

Everyone should be able to surf these repos easily, with help from their own agents.

You should gather and relinquish credentials automatically.
