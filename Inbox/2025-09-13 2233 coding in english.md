omarchy is largely run using scripting.
llms are good at scripting.

however they can bloat the code, and the don't spend time unifying things across files, but an agent could figure that bit out.

what matters tho, is the users intent.

so the bash is just how the system meets those demands.

the system must be able to spin up a sandbox of the system to test interactions.

it also must be able to capture the state of the ui at any point.

so if we keep handling the users intent, and occassionally ask them clarifying questions, then we can keep working on how to config the system without breaking anything.

plus we can look at how they operate, and suggest improvements to them, but also can move the system.

the user should be able to play with the new vwesions any time, and be able to roll back instantly.

want to share with others, and have your agents converse with other users desktop agents to discover mutual interest points between them.
