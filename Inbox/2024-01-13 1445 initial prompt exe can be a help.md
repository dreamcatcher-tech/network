If helps are a standard format that we know how to execute, then the initial prompt / goalie, can be set up as just another help.  It just so happens that it is selected by default rather than by retrieval.

This means there is only really one execution process for the whole system.

In an ai native system means that all the prompting and responses is all state, and the core plumbing just marshalls text files around, with the odd function call being made.

So the theory is that any NL system at all can be composed using these tools, where the plumbing is also handled by NL, but has some core IO based structure.

Are helps then an NL module format for NL codebases, where they can be imported and executed just like existing modules ?
