we have high discoordination between specialists in nz.
I should be able to see all the appointments available across the whole country and I should be able to see inside a single cancellation list.

there must be a way to insert a system that does this.

we could provide the practice mgmt software for free, but take a cut on any appointments we book ?
provide the clients with health management, to push demand from the consumer side ?
