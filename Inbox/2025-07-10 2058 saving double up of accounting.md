So the provider has to store a row for each request, or at least a summary, and then the dev has to store this as well, and then this is passed on to the user.  Plus telemetry.

What we need is a way to have a single source of data store, which is the provider, and then the consumers can access this directly - it is signed, irrefutable, and doesn't cost any extra storage to the provider, but they can earn from access fees to it.
