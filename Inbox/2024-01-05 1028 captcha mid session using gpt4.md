With some special questions that we know gpt4 cannot do by itself, we can ensure our system resources do not get wasted.

Ask the machine to perform some checks, such as bandwith usage, hashing, long term storage, ram, and then ask the human to perform some check by replying a certain way, or doing an image processing check, to know they are legit, or record some voice, supply device location, some other permission.

Ram test means we load up a big chunk of data, then periodically request sections in it to prove you are legit - attackers cannot really use that.  We can also make it part of our distribution network, and prove that it served webrtc calls.

Abusing our api calls isn't really that useful since we'd always be trying to sell curtains anyway, so seems hard to do anything useful with that other than burn our credits.
