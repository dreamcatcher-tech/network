First ingest all the notes that were taken or discussions.

Then for each one, break out all the ideas that were spoken about.

Find all the relevant notes that relate to these topics.
Could parse the entire file base and compare each atom one at a time, which is better than embeddings.

Then make the relevant changes.

Need something better than diffs to represent what changed ?  

Some kind of severity score, or number of new topics added - a complexity shape that shows what it did.

Need to trace back when a patch makes changes, so we know a note has been ingested.  Then search for orphans that haven't be ingested anywhere ?
