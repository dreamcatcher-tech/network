? Is this possible to make with the tools we have ?

Basically the prompt is always attached to HAL, and it can create threads, invoke helps.
Hal takes the input from Dave, asks questions to clarify the intent, and then writes clear instructions for the help files to execute.

Eg: the help could be written in japanese, and HAL would be able to easily converse with it.

HAL would start by engaging with the helpfinder, which is a bot responsible for giving HAL back the best Help to engage with.

HAL is an interpreter, and should be able to draw on files and threads to decide what to do next.  It might choose to pass the users text straight thru to the help.

The threads might be continually summarized for HAL so that it can switch more rapidly and correctly.
