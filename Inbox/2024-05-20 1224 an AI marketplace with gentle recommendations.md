Like timely, but you can explore other options on the network, with an agent that is proven to be working for you and trying to find things of value to you.  It handles your reminders and all contact goes via this agent, to shield you from annoyance.

Rescheduling is handled by this agent, where you can sell your place in the queue if someone else wants to pay enough for it.
