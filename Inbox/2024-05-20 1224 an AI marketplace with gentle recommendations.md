Like timely, but you can explore other options on the network, with an agent that is proven to be working for you and trying to find things of value to you.  It handles your reminders and all contact goes via this agent, to shield you from annoyance.

Rescheduling is handled by this agent, where you can sell your place in the queue if someone else wants to pay enough for it.

Shops can begin with their own agents that are customer facing, then our platform helps them negotiate scheduling with clients.

Even just integrating directly with amazon, where we browse the items for you, and notify on new discoveries, taking an affiliate cut from them.  We can handle all the tracking of parcels etc.
