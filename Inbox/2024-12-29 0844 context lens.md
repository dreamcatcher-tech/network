walk each file to determine relvancy to work.
This is done to build up a list of files to be included in the context for when processing occurs, and is only needed when all the files are too large for the context window.

If the list is too long, then the first task should be to modularize the files so that they can be subsetted in this way.

Can create summaries of folders and files, which can be used to select or find relevant files quicker.
