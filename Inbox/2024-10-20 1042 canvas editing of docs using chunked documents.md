A single text string to represent the document will fail to be edited effectively.

The document should be represented as several chunks, and each one should be reasoned about separately.

When an edit is to be made, it needs to be made a chunk at a time.

No document every exists without some kind of chunking inside it.  The chunks should be indexable, like paragraph numbers.
