HAL has many different designs, and so does the stuck loop.

This algorithm should be studied, documented, and alternatives evaluated.

We know what the inputs and outputs are to be, or at least how to judge which is best between two algos.

Seems everything is just A-B testing from here on in, rather than absolute tests.
