there should be a version you can set up for the human processing world too, where you are continuously testing your checks and stagegates so that in theory, a completely new person can be put in the process, and the training is the error detection.

Also purposefully injecting errors in otherwise good work is another valuable test, since if an injected error made it thru, you need to scrutinize the whole batch since your QA is clearly busted.

ideally, the error detection would be an LLM of sorts, and the error message is helpful to the human, so their training is done at the same time, but based on actual work, not just theory

This same thing should be applied to LLMs, along with techniques like sampling, complete batch audits of the integrity of the whole system, etc.
