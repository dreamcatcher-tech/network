If the component is generated in a sanitized environment, then it results in just pure JSON that gets rendered on the client side. 

This could be a lightweight, high-performance way to render client-side UI where the components are hostile and that we rendered them on the server and then sent them down. There might need to be additional bundling checks to ensure the code can compile and can be packaged and published without issue.
