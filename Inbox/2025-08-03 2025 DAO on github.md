start the DAO as being purely facts based.

Say what we know, and the probability that we are sure of it, plus the source it came from.
These could be fed in to deep research agents.
Provide ways that pages can be scraped and snapshotted.

use issues to raise discrepancies.
use mcp servers to pull in the issues and process them.
the dao agent is what goes thru and decides these things, like the cmd email.
