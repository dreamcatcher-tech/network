If the kyc was done using soulbound tokens, and assets could not be transferred to a non soulbound address, and transferring the soulbinding required admin approval whilst moving all your assets with it, then an international bank like company could be run on chain.

The chain would handle the IT costs of operation, and ensure trust amongst the user base.

Modelling the business as more participatory can increase awareness, access to liquidity, and be more resilient to changes.
Payout to banks could be done by sending to a specific address.
The total funds in each bank could be posted onchain and accounted for automatically.
Liquidity providing between banks could be done by a marketplace, where people earn fees for supplying money in a timely fashion.  They would need a special level of soulbinding to be eligible for this.
Fees could vary based on the liquidity available at each bank.
Details of what bank to pay out from could be encrypted or passed as just a hash that the bank operator can decrypt or has access to.

Use tornado cash to hold everyones funds, so that you cannot prove how much money anyone else has got, but each member knows their own balance.

Can provide further masking by making one address per address.
