So the api would allow you to request a json object representing a function that was available, and then you would dispatch into a particular branch, with the process type you wanted, and POST that to the server api.

This would give you back a commit id maybe.

So an input in the browser just sends actions in to a specific chain, and can do things like start a new session by using that specific action.
