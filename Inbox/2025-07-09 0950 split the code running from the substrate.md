We could use deno deploy for the logic and the provider work, and then have a private fly.io app that does the running of untrusted code dynamically ?

This then makes running these things a service that is connected to separately.

So if you know ahead of time what napps you want, you just bake these in to the deploy, otherwise use the dynamic network.

Means we can vary each part independently ?
