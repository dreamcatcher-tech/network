Each agent needs to run independent of the others, so we need a way to indicate which agent is being run ?  And to see inside it ?

Prompt should be able to get the switchboard to choose something, like if I say "the files agent".

When the thread runs, we see the switchboard churning, then it calls a function call

Assistants need to be named by the hash of the git file that made them, so there is no ambiguity.
