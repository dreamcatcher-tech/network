Make a mapping for all fields that are set to a non default value.

Take note of any record that has fields we have not converted into something.

take note of the template and when we have say, 5 fields not in the template, stop and ask for the template to be reviewed.

We also need mappings from xml fields, so when we see new fields, we stop until they are included in the mapping.

Template includes help info about each field in the customer files.
