The utility of an intrinsic currency is that it cannot be stopped.  It is censorship resitant since it does not represent any assets other than itself.

The problem to solve is its stability, since having no internal value, it is subject to speculation.

If the general compute market minted some of this currency each time computation was exchanged, based on the units computed, then this marker could be transferred around and used as money. So the money is an NFT representing completed computational work.

If the compute work is found to be false, then the NFT is rolled back.
After mint, it gets wrapped in one of our serverless objects, so can be traded with the same rules and provenances.

Its price would need to be free floating, as it would have value because it was believed to have value, and would be subject to swings.

The compute market could trade in this currency, to give it a base stability.
So if you want pure stability, you need to pay in fiat.  But if you can tolerate some volatility, then this currency may be good for you as it is unstoppable, and has an issuance mechism that artificially creates a scarcity.

So we start making them by default, and tie up their value into the compute chain somehow, to give them a base price.  The initial owner is whoever purchased the compute.  You can supply compute for only these tokens.

Purchasing compute for fiat is offering to buy some of these compute tokens at some set price.  

A unit of compute is always a unit, no matter what, and its always getting cheaper, but it is very stable.  It might get more expensive if energy gets more expensive.

The system may permit the redemption of  these tokens as some fraction of the total compute.  So they have a value, and act like a discount to the compute.

Can make it so only over a certain size generates tokens.
Maybe only the redeemable part is a token, and so the tokens can be spent to pay for compute, provided there is enough genuine load in the system.
They are always redeemable as long as there is enough paying customers of the main chain.  Their value is always stable because the resource they offer is stable, but slowly decaying.

A good way to spend them is to use them to purchase compute resources, offer this to people to purchase, then keep the coins generated as a side effect.
