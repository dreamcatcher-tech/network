Can watch a single pierce at a time come in to the system and view the change in the branch layout and filesystem changes within those branches.

Can tick thru each internal action / poolable action and see the effect of each one.  Can see them in a list grouped by branch id and commit so can skip ahead to a specific one.

Once have narrowed it down, then can use vscode to run the exact isolate code that it ran, rerun LLM calls, etc.

Can replay with different shuffled order of internal actions, which you can control by drag and drop, and have it regenerate everything after, to see if there is some interplay of timing.
