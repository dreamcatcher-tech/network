In the chat context that might be shown ?
Can have an icon showing the tools available, then clicking on it will bring up the model context and highlight the tools available section.

What about add context from mcp servers ?

Adding more context should be easy - just click on it and add it.
Can add it in chat, or can use the context widget to do it.

Search chats could be the tools for chat, where you can merge several chats, fork a chat, copy the context of another chat.  This could be offered in the chat context panel too ?

@ context ? add @chats and @files ?

Context changes, add, update, remove, can show as separate chat events.
