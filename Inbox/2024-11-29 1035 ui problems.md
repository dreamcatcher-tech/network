When dealing with multiple artifacts, how should we allow the user to see them all ?

Selecting multiple agents ?

Showing all files that are available ?

Browsing multiple repos ?

How to talk about other chats ?
 - Show sections of other chats as an artifact

Bring new artifacts into an existing chat ?

The selection model, where you select different parts of the interface, and this shows up over the prompt, so it gets included on the next input.

How would having my own app with connections to the CRM be presented ?
Need some way to show that I'm logged in to something remote, like all the chats are grouped as this different origin ? like a different network ?

group artifacts by repo
click on repo to get browser of the repo

Artifacts would show up individually, which are widgets and modified docs.
They would be grouped by the backing repos and files within them.
The files for the chat would be grouped by repo too, and you could add more in by selecting repos, or by using in chat to search for repos, or use the repo browsing widget.

The stateboard can be switched to show the context of the current thread, like an explorer view, and then individual artifacts are selectable too, which then show in the stateboard.

Search chats should start a new chat with all the chats loaded as context, grouped by repo or by time.
Different repos show with little decorations or color codes.

In the chat controls box, have edits, uploads, references, and maybe bulk changes ?

Context controls handles all the context that has been pulled in for the model, and lets you select them to jump back to them, like mapping components, or customer search components.

It looks like a document, but is a special kind, in that it is always present, and gives access to all the documents.  Agents come with their own access preconfigured.

"Remote Agents" are those that are run on another system, like the CRM.  They can be interacted with your agents, and they may expose some functions you can call with your agents, but the thread happens on the remote computer ?

Does it even matter who runs it tho ?  If you're authd and the api allows, just let it happen ?  So the prompts and models can be sent to the local running thing ?
A remote chat would be just an api call ?

Dropdown in new chat to allow remote chats ?

Can see the tools of the agent ? or open up an agent browser ?
Can also access this in chat ?

? Is there a way to do reasoning about the app, so that we can set up a bunch of reasoned out features that we need, so we have logically reconciled all parts of the app ?
