When dealing with multiple artifacts, how should we allow the user to see them all ?

Selecting multiple agents ?

Showing all files that are available ?

Browsing multiple repos ?

How to talk about other chats ?
 - Show sections of other chats as an artifact

Bring new artifacts into an existing chat ?

The selection model, where you select different parts of the interface, and this shows up over the prompt, so it gets included on the next input.

How would having my own app with connections to the CRM be presented ?
Need some way to show that I'm logged in to something remote, like all the chats are grouped as this different origin ? like a different network ?
