multi agent, multi session, where everything is in context all the time.

Show how the future of apps is, with everything in context, providing instant info about what everyone else is up to.

Then show summary of the list to show how to save tokens.

So we could make apps in this way for a purposefully small dataset, and so long as we had summary info of the todolist, the in context would be possible, so it compresses x lines into the window, and uses this as the reference.

Things like deduplication, updating all relevant items when a single item gets dropped in.
So long as we manage the scope to always fit a context window, or we shard the windows effectively, then the apps are happening in context all the time.

Easy to segment todo lists into topic areas.
Easy to produce a report about progress.

Shared todo lists between peers can be kept up to date easily by patching in the changes from others
