human tools are very large, because humans manage scoping internally.

So what about a preprocessor that does this scoping and zooming to allow concentration of the bot, before it digs into a specific tool ?

So we recreate the scope action of a human, and take an extra step to consider before picking a tool.

we would be building our own compartments of a broader tool set, rather than expecting the bot to take them all in raw.

We could have other bots or swarms that figure out this comparementalization and share with others so that quickly it learns the cut lines that have the best results with a certain model.
