There is some physical service that is required to allow rapid combination of other services.

Uber sort of has it, but there needs to be a matternet that makes it easy to move anything anywhere, rapidly, cheaply, with a range of cooling and mass options.

Then we can move to supply chains that are more whitelabel, silent, background - like a supermarket that is dark, and then various suppliers front end it.  It should be able to give wholesale level pricing, instant delivery, bulk or small - using automation and the matternet.
