Read aloud would type out the thing directly.
Summerize aloud would do a summary specifically for voice, so kill excessive bullet pointing, and other things that don't translate well to voice.

Emails that were chatted about in a team setting.  Lets other people actually handle your emails, and can let them modify things in your pipeline, so they can see everything in your queue and can deduplicate themselves by attaching on to another email about the same thing, and just adding some weight.

AI would do the deduplication search for you, so they would tell you.

Also show the processed messages and let you process those too.
