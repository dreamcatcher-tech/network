Could have multiple stateboards going at once, and could display different content on each one.

Could set it up like multiple screens, where each one could hold a webpage that we rendered different content to.

ERDs could be displayed as a mermaid chart, or as an exploded node map.
The node map positions could be altered by the user and stored in HAL, or relaid out.
Nodes could be edited on the fly by AI as more information was added to the chat.

Mic in could be via a webpage, or via the noda api perhaps.  Or have a background app.

HAL in control means easy filtering.
