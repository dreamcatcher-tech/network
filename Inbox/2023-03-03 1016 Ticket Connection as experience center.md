A SaaS company sells tickets for broadway shows in NYC.  These tickets should be NFTs and they should allow additional information to be attached.  In show photos, photos from other people - should all pivot around this central ticket.

As an NFT that is a memorable item, it can be purchased as a gift set which are very special tickets with photos attached.  Using freely availble apps, photo storage can be provided with the ticket so that if you find the ticket one day, you can load up the media attached with the experience and relive being there again.
