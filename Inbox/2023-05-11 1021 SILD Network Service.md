The Networking infrastructure of the island provides a good example use case of several aspects that we might consider standardizing on the island.

The number of starlinks on the island should be restricted, since the service quality and pricing of everyone elses starlink goes up with each added dish.  Because the spectrum is a resource that is limited in supply but that everyone needs, the usage should be centrally controlled by DAO vote.

Who should have what weighted say in the distribution of such a resource ?  We can immediately calculate a density funciton whereby we

The usage of a starlink should require that the access be shared with others for some reasonable price, since you are consuming a resource that only some of the island can use at once.

We should come up with a general formula for the management of scarce resources that allows a fair price to be set for sharing it, rewards those who invest in making the resource consumable by others, and incentivizes further innovations in the area.

There should be no lock in to starlink per-se, but usage should be related to spectrum consumption.
