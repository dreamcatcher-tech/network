We should be able to have the unit tests be happening in parallel, in lambda functions, using chains.

Plus the heavy lift is handled by openAI, so we should be able to get the results of having huge numbers of processes, greater than 10x what any single machine could do, instantly happening, so we get instant feedback. 

This sells compute usage on our platform, and it gives devs more power than they would otherwise have.  Dev in chainland is not subject to limits like disk size, cpu numbers, or single computer rate limits.

Sharing is trivial to do.
