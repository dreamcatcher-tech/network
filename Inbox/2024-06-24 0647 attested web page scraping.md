Use an isolated github runner to produce attested artifacts from a URL.

Allow multiple versions of these runners to produce results for comparisons.

Sell the artifacts in a marketplace, so that people just ask for them, then the runners kick off and return the result.  This should be the most trusted view of the web pages possible.

make an object that holds all these different views together, so it can be treated with a single handle.
