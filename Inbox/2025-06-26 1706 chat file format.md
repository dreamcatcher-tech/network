the napp for this would be a jsr module ?

would run server side only

client might pull in the schemas.

use the ai sdk for types and schemas.

transcludes are our own pointer / format.

each folder needs some metadata to summarize things like the permissions, who is involved, message stats.

if its a chat between multiple people, then you all have a copy, and you use transcludes to keep everyones versions up to date.

so each message will have a timestamp on it ? and a ulid ?  the ulid is the filename.  clients can only post increasing messages.

translucudes have a repoid, which is the repo that created the transclude.
