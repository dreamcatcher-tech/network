The margins on gym equipment are obscenely high, and low cost access is actually a public good.

We should be able to make a gym equipment setup like a mini-mill, using some standard components that can just be reconfigured. For example, the grinder and the watt light and the grower share this central unit that provides resistance to a circular load. Additionally, the devices both have some kind of circular driving force. Now, this being separate from the main resistance area, seems unnecessary if it was just simply the grinding ability was fitted with a motor. Now, that motor could be programmed to generate a particular load, which can charge a battery or do some other useful thing. Additionally, it can be run in both directions, and it can provide differing amounts of resistance, including shock load. So you could be grinding with shock coming back into the muscle. You could be pedaling, so it can have a coasting effect as well. So really, it's just this single motor and different attachments for how you connect your body to it. The rest is programmable.

Along with the modular gym equipment idea, we can also sell modular attachments, such as fans and other things that just jack into the power bus. They can be programmed to drive in proportion to how the power coming out of the devices. Basically, these devices should need no batteries, no maintenance, and to replace any of the equipment you have, it's just these parts. Again, we can make them open source, and the attachments can be all open source, so they can be assembled from a local supplier. They could be made out of plywood, using a localised manufacturing cell. It should be very cheap and very fast to find these replacement parts, as well as parametrically designed custom fits for your particular purpose, depending on things like the body types you aim to service, and the area you have available. As well, they become transportable, so they can be moved outdoors. They should be waterproof. They could possibly be hooked up as direct generators in a system like boats

Might be able to do weights simulation with these same motors.

Regen should be a super cap for rapid high load absorption and low maintenance and low pricing.

To make new attachments, you should be able to chat about it, and machines will generate options for you.
