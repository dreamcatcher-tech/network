If we could offer very cheap storage of binary data using backblaze, like an LFS addon, then we can sell the management convenience and deduplication of storage amongst customers.

Portability - being able to have your data in multiple places - with us, locally, with peers.

Low latency availability.

Gives an AI control layer to large binary data, and a huge processing capability.

Shared storage and quick transfer between peers on the system is a good benefit.

Means we can have very cheap, low latency, guaranteed available storage.

We can also store across other providers.

Then make a decentralized API compatible clone.
