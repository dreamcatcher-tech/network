If we had a router that could break up questions and direct them use specific docs, so that a full doc could be loaded up into context each time.

Or, using vector, relevant snippets loaded.

Maybe spawning an agent causes a new top level agent to be created, rather than a fork ? it could use the same tree as the current branch ?  This means it can be interacted with by anyone as a genuine bot, without any owneshipt in the current session.

Make a multiagent mode, where it permits multiple callers to converse with it.

This pattern there is a base image, then a bot instance, and then sessions with this bot.  The sessions can merge back to the master branch when they change something.  They pull from the master branch periodically so they stay in sync.

? Would this mean the CRM was a collection of different repos, rather than a single one ?
