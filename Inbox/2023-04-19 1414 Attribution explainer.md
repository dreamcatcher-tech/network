Be able to rapidly model scenarios that people ask questions about.
Have a selection of pre constructed scenarios shown on the side based on similarity.
Search for projects based on which ones have actually behaved like the proposed model and show how their outcomes were affected.

It should involve actors with predefined types, contributing to different projects, then a customer.  Can show a steady state, or show transition states in frames where one scenario then becomes the second.  'Create Frame' copies the current scen, and sequences it afterwards.

The variation in payment should ultimately come down to customer.  The choice of algorithm is up to the customer to choose.

Show how selfwashing, or purchasing from your self in order to gain votes is immune.

The [[Dreamcatcher Algorithm]] is an algorithm that can fairly attribute a payment amongst all its contributors.  Basically it measures the value of human contribution between different contribution flavours, and balanced against the value of resources, such as money.  We do expect it to be a large parameter model.  It's correctness is determined mostly by the general consensus of its users, rather than some strict parameters that can be satisfied.
