If we use intermediary steps for gpt4 reasoning, and get those steps dumped out, and then when we get the steps right we then use them on some output, then a parallel pipeline can be set up that asks the AI to keep these steps in memory only, rather than generating them.

Both pipeline output quality is compared, and so we know we have got it right if the dump to disk steps can be removed for speed, and the results still perform well.
