This should call up the repeater napp, which will interpret the glob patterns and might ask some questions about it.

Give it the napp to call ?

this is an isolate command that takes in some glob patterns, a napp

So repeater is a tool call, which the napp that knows what it wants

? could it also run a tool call on them all ?
? would that be in a separate branch for each call ?

Reducer would do the same, but would collate the results somehow.

Should use a batching function which can amplify the speed greatly by sending out a range of batch commands that in turn may call further batching commands, so we get max speed for the burstability of our system.  Gives us early start characteristcs, and can run the reducing function in parallel too since it runs in each segment.
