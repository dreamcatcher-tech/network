This should call up the repeater napp, which will interpret the glob patterns and might ask some questions about it.

Give it the napp to call ?

this is an isolate command that takes in some glob patterns, a napp

So repeater is a tool call, which the napp that knows what it wants

? could it also run a tool call on them all ?
? would that be in a separate branch for each call ?

Reducer would do the same, but would collate the results somehow.

Should use a batching function which can amplify the speed greatly by sending out a range of batch commands that in turn may call further batching commands, so we get max speed for the burstability of our system.  Gives us early start characteristcs, and can run the reducing function in parallel too since it runs in each segment.

So the repeater isolate is called by something that knows how to use it, and that napp has dependency napps.

```ts
repeater( { globs: ['./*'], napp: 'segmenter-napp' } )
```

Probably get it to run once just to return the filenames.

Doesn't make sense to make a tool that knew about the repeater and was expected to know how to call all the other napps that it might get asked to do.  A napp that knows about the repeater tool and all the other napps it wants to run is required, since it knows how to craft responses for those napps.
