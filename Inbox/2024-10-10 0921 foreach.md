This should call up the repeater, which will interpret the glob patterns and might ask some questions about it.

this is an isolate command that takes in some glob patterns, a napp


? could it also run a tool call on them all ?

Reducer would do the same, but would collate the results somehow.

Should use a batching function which can amplify the speed greatly by sending out a range of batch commands that in turn may call further batching commands, so we get max speed for the burstability of our system.  Gives us early start characteristcs, and can run the reducing function in parallel too since it runs in each segment.
