Be able to describe and test an app using prompting.  Provide examples and insert these into the prompt document.  The prompt spec doc is the assemblage of all the things that were accumulated to describe the app in detail in a single hit.  This allows innovation to occur where humans try prompt differently to hit the spec doc with a better score.  The AI can continually try to innovate on it but this burns compute power.

Say what the general idea is, and have a framework by which gpt4 can feed back in on itself until the end result, having run thru the execution engine and with some synthetically generated data, accurately represents the starting intent.

Blockchain native feature would be powerful for a large company like shell wanted to innovate by having its staff generate little apps but know that they are safe, reliable, repeatable, and reusable within the company.

Build a set of components for an app that are AI compliant - so a table component designed so an AI can manipulate the display easily, or in a way that best suits it.

Covenant schemas seems a good place to start, and then describing some based app architectures in a way the AI can iterate thru until they have a good score on the spec doc.
