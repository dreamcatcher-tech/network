X could complement a truth seeking policy where by AI tools help people find what is correct, and then they can stake funds against their statements as being true, and retweeters can stake too.

Everyone who reads them pays a small fee, so its worth being a staker.

If you are proven wrong, the stake gets paid to everyone who read and paid a royalty payment to you, as well as to the solver, and to the platform.

You can set a time where you stake is retracted.

Others can restake if you pull out, it just means the royalties will be shared more.

This balances the goal of making things more widely read, with the goal of making things truthful.

Staking could include a sponsorship piece where people receive a payment for reading what you said - the platform takes a cut of this.  Recomendations for products should be relevant to what the person wants.
