The principle of the workbench is that we should never have to give the same instructions twice.  There should be a dream cycle, where when the human sleeps, the machine does batch processing to make sure it hasn't missed anything at all, and that it has interpreted all instructions correctly, and can reference them when asked about them. 

It should be building up knowledge about each user, and also sharing with each other.  It should be spotting trends, and also social trends amongst peers.
