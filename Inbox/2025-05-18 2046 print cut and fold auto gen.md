Making cuts and folds with artwork is very time-consuming. If we had a generative tool that could turn text into a 3D object which was made of a print and a fold system, and we could make sure that there was some scoring being done on the card to make it nicely foldable, we applied best practice and in terms of the springiness that we want to avoid seeing in the model (tabs ease of insertion, etc.).

So you could work on making this model that would be visualized, and when you were finally happy, you could have a machine cut it out and print it. You may need a little bit of refinement, but the amount of time is not this huge whopping great days-worth of time.

And you're not restricted to only pulling in pre-tested, vetted files that have no meaning or connection to you. So the net result is you would burn a lot of tokens, you'd have a lot of fun, and you'd buy more consumables than if you never tried it at all
