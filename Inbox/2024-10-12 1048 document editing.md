Definitely want to have a layered approach, so be able to work on an overview, and then reprioritize that, move it around, and then start to do some generation of text.

Want to be able to draw on my own knowledge base so I don't keep having to repeat myself each time.
Should be able to guide the bot to different parts of my knowledge tree, and use that as the basis for what I am trying to do.

Everyone should be free to develop their own process, and it should be very easy to do so.  They should at worst be able to say what their requirements are of it, so that someone else can come and make it for them.
