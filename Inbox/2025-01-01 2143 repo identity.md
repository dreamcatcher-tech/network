We could use a random number, but we could include some config that gives it a form of consensus, right from the start ?

What about if we just clone, then we can verify the tags and things for consensus, but that seems about it ?

Somehow in some root config, something needs to be said for the repo's id, and who is paying for it, and who has permission to access it.

Could be set up no owners and pure user pays.

Map repo identity to short names, like dns addresses.

The id can be backed by the consensus mechanism, eventually.
