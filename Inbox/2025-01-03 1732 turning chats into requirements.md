Even while we're chatting, we should be able to raise concerns and the bot detects it, and other ones, and update the requirements or the checks / tests that need to be covered.  So if we're just asking questions, it will detect which ones are important enough to include in the rules files so the project gets some extra good constraints.

Maybe need a test file that describes what tests are and what rule they are trying to cover ?

RULES.md that lists out the things that the formula doesn't cover.

Can also hold design decisions ?
