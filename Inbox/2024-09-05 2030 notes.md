file creation and stuck creation in the message as a dedicated ui element.  Allow selection to make that show up in the stateboard, and show as the selection in the prompt.

drill down into the test runs, so use can browse the outcome.
Make a widget that shows what the conversation looked like.  Make the test assessor show as something special.

switchboard defender, which can answer questions about why they switchboard did what it did
switchboard ui but can also be a chattable agent

switchbot should be able to absorb calls, like when it gets told about how the user wants to use a specific bot, it should not say anything, but should simply prime up with the selected agent and pause, awaiting the instructions from the user.

? how to do the iterative loop of improvement to some files, rerunning tests, then ultimately committing and reverting the tests ?
Sounds like a horrible time where our tools are buggy, but as they stabilize they get better.

Make an example config that shows everything possible.

Check the test files to ensure they specify valid agents, and that their config is structured correctly.
Strip out the assessor requirement.

Function to list or browse isolates.  Possibly in a widget for navigation.
When browsing, execution is possible too, optionally in a branch.

Agent display panel that honours front matter or yaml.
Markdown tool should show frontmatter as separate, in pre blocks.
Agent display tool should resolve all links, and maybe highlight them.

File explorer and editing widget.

Using the test workbench bot, fork a new test branch in which to make modifications to agents in isolation.  These modifications can be chatted up or manually edited using a widget.  The changes can be run and chatted with as tho they were the primary thread.

The workbench can call the test controller to run tests that exercise the test branch files.  The workbench examines the results, navigates thru the test runs to see every message that occurred, then modifies the sandbox in the test branch and rerun the tests.

Add descriptions from the agent descriptions into switchboard.  How should this be inserted ?
Can create a function to read this in from all the agents whenever the switchboard runs ?
Can cache it against the hash of the agents directory so it doesn't need to run every time ?
Or just rely on caching in the deployment to bring this down.  Could be a link to a function, so we can link to an isolate using the isolate protocol, and the output of that function will be inserted into the file every time it gets loaded ?

Add a youtube player stateboard item. 

Seems we need a way to navigate branches, and the dispatch actions into them.

Make the target be treated like a deferred thread, which is run as long as no indication of escape is given.

Should use the stateboard as the way of using the messages thread to display more things, like the agent definitions should show up in stateboard, not in messages.

What to do on openAI errors ?  allow manual retry, preserve the thread.  Set url hash for threads

Remapper should allow some dummy reasoning params.

Summary tool that updates the description each time the agent gets written.

Button to go to the bottom of the messages scroll
Search in messages.

Store system and seed to be able to recreate the output of something ?

Permissions management in HAMR.

Busy bar to show tokens burning.

Redo what the user put in.
Regenerate bot output, maybe.  chatgpt removes the input box and gives only a regenerate box.

HAMR needs to save files, then merge file back up to parent, so that other threads receive it.

files:search.  Do a search for a particular customer.
"show me every customer starts with A."
```js
search({
	fileGlobs: ["customers/*", "routes/*"],
	query: "All pickups this week not on thursday, where the file was updated before tuesday",
	sort: "Date of update, grouped by person to last edit"
	limit: 10,
})
```
Searches need to squash merge back in, or have branches that do groups of queries.

rewrite selections in stateboard as the user changes, storing only the last one for the prompt.

The stateboard selection is:
`[]( isolate://stateboard:readCurrentState( { } ) )`

Index creation tooling

Select message should show the thread in the stateboard, selected.  This would have scroll buttons, and a toolbar to let you skip forwards and back by message.

up and down scroll buttons on messages.

files read file modification and permissions info.
also read previous version.

map reduce for producing manifest files.

Athropomorphicize the agents

action at a distance - remote threads.

Buttons in the editor, to get the creatorBot to format and clean up the whole file, or just the changes I made.  Also get it to optimize, or run it in tests.

add message index to the hash, so can share links that highlight a specific message, and show it as selected.  Store the selection of the stateboard as part of the hash, so it gets shared around too.

Handle invalid remote threads - should result in the fragment being cleared

commit should be a fork action.

files needs a metadata function call, which can read the information about the file, like last modified time.
Also a versions call, to get hashes of different versions, then use those version hashes to pull out metadata at a specific point.  The hash might be that of the commit that it refers to.  Versions needs a limit, or some other params like dates.

Allow manual editing of the hash fragment

Clicking on a commit should do a fork, so it can be shared in a finalized state.  Anyone who then acts on it, would create a fork ?

isolates agent
run this as a drone - how to specify the commands ?

test generator from threads to make it easy to record faults as tests.
Single button to generate a new test, taking the current thread as the base contents.

New thread hotkeys, or a button to generate it.

The actual test system, so we can get to be test first.

View agent contents

start a new remote thread that only allows the single o1 agent.  switchboard would be limited to the selected agents.

While generating, write out the system prompt to the thread, or at least write out the blank response, plus system fingerprint.

Add token counts, and reasoning token counts into the UI.  Possibly as aux data attached to the message sequence number.  Also calculation time.

Dynamic tests, so can test all agents against a certain test file.

Lock agents from modification inside the same thread - must be done remotely.

Switchboard needs to store state where it can narrow or expand its bots.

Prompt hacking to make switchboard sticky.

list the agents in the stateboard.
with a launchpad at the landing page.
Should be programmable somehow too.

Gracefully catch badly written agent files.
Make a CI check on the branch if the agent files changed, before a PR is attempted.
Trigger something that runs whenever the agent files change.

isolate function calls inside the agent, to add the time.

hand off bots that rewrite prompts.
switchboard absorb some prompts.

/ to break out of switchboard, possibly fuzzily.

tie the commit graph navigation to the message object, so we can fork.

rewrite in a fork with a bot, in order to comcmit a large number of changes in a single merge.  So sandbox, then merge.

Copy and paste whole files in and out of the system.

consistent file display based on hash.

a knowledge about the system inner workings that can be drawn on by any bot, like the system help manual, that can be vector queried, which can be a specialist bot that answers for you, and can be given the whole context.

show the message object in the stateboard.
o1 as drone

NL appraisal of the error state.  Read thru the manual, look at repetitive occurances, then come back to the user, possibly trigger a bug report.  Here's the error, here's the progress, need more money, plz pay here.  Say it is a known error, or new error.

triggers when agents folder changes.
Also do prettier formatting.

hardstop limits need to increase, and the bot should give some output.  Or just detect repetitive loops.

Readaloud function to select some text or a whole message and read it out aloud using HD voice at different speeds.  Also give a voice summary of the whole thing.

An account and a home directory for MA to be able to contribute.

Make a response from backchat prompt that can signal for the webpage to clear its application data and reload the page, using an account manager agent which does logout.

If specify no agent in tests, default to sending in to the thread via the router.

Schedule bot: what is the schedule for tomorrow ?
- this should show the map on the stateboard

Be able to:
- prompt bots
- modify files
- show widgets
- modify files using widgets and the selection model
- test all the operations using NL tests

tick forwards and back buttons to allow timetravel in the commit graph, possibly by hotkey.

What widgets have you got ?

Selection of the messages in the message thread.
Selection of the primary target element vs the rest of the selections.

May allow selections between screens, so multiple paths.

"what model was used in the last call ?"
bot that knows how to read and interpret the thread file, so can give that exact answer, by way of introspection.

"Hal play the song scorpio girls" - I would expect it to use a streaming serivce, or go out and download the song I want, and then check the song once downloaded so it could confirm the quality and the song being correct, then maybe fetch the lyrics and find a bunch of trivia.

A widget library, that shows visual representations of the widgets, and lets you zoom in on them, analyze a particular one.  The chat agent knows about the widgets so can answer questions about how to use it, and offers things like videos and other interations.

Files widget should be a single widget, that can be in different modes.
Each layer should be able to get out into the other layer, but only if the stateboard was configured to allow this.

Give each layer the ability to click up to the next one.
May allow navigation to help you get back to where you were ?  Or at least honour undo actions.

Clipboard that causes a selection to be sticky on the prompt, allowing you to select more.

Is there a way to map out the knowledge spec / range of the system, so we can know about areas we are missing, and functions that are incomplete ?  Be able to describe very plainly what they areas of the domain are.

Select in the widget includes primary target, as well as additional focused items.
Editing of the item shows as the editing having occured.
The prompt allows deletion of the selected items.
When you change focus after having editing, we can add that to the prompt stack, so you can discard it if you want.

select a default bot, possibly by root state config, possibly by a preferences file, possibly by having a default thread that gets cloned.

The transcription data should store in a file, so you can reuse them if you like.

Multiple taps on the transcription button should add to the text, not replace it each time.

How to make test that builds of an existing prompt, and does a single run of it ? so everything is already preconfigured, in perhaps a synthetic way, but then the bot needs to behave as expected.

Test if using the assistants api is faster to call for large threads.

Hold ctrl and then scroll by message unit as opposed to pixel.

FAB above messages like chatgpt to immediately scroll to the bottom.  Expand this out to have tick by message and other helpful increments.

version navigation in the file explorer and editor, which moves you in the commit graph to the previous version.
With diffing on, will show the diff to the previous commit ?

Diffing between commits, if you select more than one, or in a special mode, where the previous selection is used as a diff to the current selected on, possibly this only shows up in the diff viewer.

empty text should not cause Dave to be busy forever.

show agent fully expanded to stop hunting and pecking.

how do we measure our own amplification.

editor writing and new file creation.

search in thread using manual, or by using a reflection bot, so can talk about the messages and ask why things happened.

cache by oid so no flickering in the editor

help button that takes a screenshot and the commit that we're on for fault finding.

wtf button ? should be agent to switch to.  Should be happening passively too.

CRM updates on manifest progress using voice messages, possibly via whatsapp.

What a little device that can record and take pictures and show threads, like r1.

forking a branch where the branch fork is stored on local computer, and presented in the same ui as the cloud one, in a different color, since the cloud deployment cares not where it gets its commits from.

extract compact repros by recording what files in a commit were read between the next one, so we can save a lot of space, and still be able to recreate the error between the two.

whatsapp bot that you can talk to, and send in voice messages for transcription.

sns for notification on thread changes in a repo.
