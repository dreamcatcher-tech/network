file creation and stuck creation in the message as a dedicated ui element.  Allow selection to make that show up in the stateboard, and show as the selection in the prompt.

drill down into the test runs, so use can browse the outcome.
Make a widget that shows what the conversation looked like.  Make the test assessor show as something special.

switchboard defender, which can answer questions about why they switchboard did what it did
switchboard ui but can also be a chattable agent

switchbot should be able to absorb calls, like when it gets told about how the user wants to use a specific bot, it should not say anything, but should simply prime up with the selected agent and pause, awaiting the instructions from the user.

? how to do the iterative loop of improvement to some files, rerunning tests, then ultimately committing and reverting the tests ?
Sounds like a horrible time where our tools are buggy, but as they stabilize they get better.

Make an example config that shows everything possible.

Check the test files to ensure they specify valid agents, and that their config is structured correctly.
Strip out the assessor requirement.

Function to list or browse isolates.  Possibly in a widget for navigation.
When browsing, execution is possible too, optionally in a branch.

Agent display panel that honours front matter or yaml.
Markdown tool should show frontmatter as separate, in pre blocks.
Agent display tool should resolve all links, and maybe highlight them.

File explorer and editing widget.

Using the test workbench bot, fork a new test branch in which to make modifications to agents in isolation.  These modifications can be chatted up or manually edited using a widget.  The changes can be run and chatted with as tho they were the primary thread.

The workbench can call the test controller to run tests that exercise the test branch files.  The workbench examines the results, navigates thru the test runs to see every message that occurred, then modifies the sandbox in the test branch and rerun the tests.

Add descriptions from the agent descriptions into switchboard.  How should this be inserted ?
Can create a function to read this in from all the agents whenever the switchboard runs ?
Can cache it against the hash of the agents directory so it doesn't need to run every time ?
Or just rely on caching in the deployment to bring this down.  Could be a link to a function, so we can link to an isolate using the isolate protocol, and the output of that function will be inserted into the file every time it gets loaded ?

Add a youtube player stateboard item. 

Seems we need a way to navigate branches, and the dispatch actions into them.

Make the target be treated like a deferred thread, which is run as long as no indication of escape is given.

Should use the stateboard as the way of using the messages thread to display more things, like the agent definitions should show up in stateboard, not in messages.

What to do on openAI errors ?  allow manual retry, preserve the thread.  Set url hash for threads

Remapper should allow some dummy reasoning params.

Summary tool that updates the description each time the agent gets written.

Button to go to the bottom of the messages scroll
Search in messages.

Store system and seed to be able to recreate the output of something ?

Permissions management in HAMR.

Busy bar to show tokens burning.

Redo what the user put in.
Regenerate bot output, maybe.  chatgpt removes the input box and gives only a regenerate box.

HAMR needs to save files, then merge file back up to parent, so that other threads receive it.

files:search.  Do a search for a particular customer.
"show me every customer starts with A."
```js
search({
	fileGlobs: ["customers/*", "routes/*"],
	query: "All pickups this week not on thursday, where the file was updated before tuesday",
	sort: "Date of update, grouped by person to last edit"
	limit: 10,
})
```
Searches need to squash merge back in, or have branches that do groups of queries.

rewrite selections in stateboard as the user changes, storing only the last one for the prompt.

The stateboard selection is:
`[]( isolate://stateboard:readCurrentState( { } ) )`

Index creation tooling

Select message should show the thread in the stateboard, selected.  This would have scroll buttons, and a toolbar to let you skip forwards and back by message.

up and down scroll buttons on messages.

files read file modification and permissions info.
also read previous version.

map reduce for producing manifest files.

Athropomorphicize the agents

action at a distance - remote threads.

Buttons in the editor, to get the creatorBot to format and clean up the whole file, or just the changes I made.  Also get it to optimize, or run it in tests.

add message index to the hash, so can share links that highlight a specific message, and show it as selected.  Store the selection of the stateboard as part of the hash, so it gets shared around too.

Handle invalid remote threads - should result in the fragment being cleared

commit should be a fork action.

files needs a metadata function call, which can read the information about the file, like last modified time.
Also a versions call, to get hashes of different versions, then use those version hashes to pull out metadata at a specific point.  The hash might be that of the commit that it refers to.  Versions needs a limit, or some other params like dates.

Allow manual editing of the hash fragment

Clicking on a commit should do a fork, so it can be shared in a finalized state.  Anyone who then acts on it, would create a fork ?

isolates agent
run this as a drone - how to specify the commands ?

test generator from threads to make it easy to record faults as tests.
Single button to generate a new test, taking the current thread as the base contents.

New thread hotkeys, or a button to generate it.

The actual test system, so we can get to be test first.

View agent contents

start a new remote thread that only allows the single o1 agent.  switchboard would be limited to the selected agents.

While generating, write out the system prompt to the thread, or at least write out the blank response, plus system fingerprint.

Add token counts, and reasoning token counts into the UI.  Possibly as aux data attached to the message sequence number.  Also calculation time.

Dynamic tests, so can test all agents against a certain test file.
