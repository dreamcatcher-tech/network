file creation and stuck creation in the message as a dedicated ui element.

drill down into the test runs, so use can browse the outcome.
Make a widget that shows what the conversation looked like.  Make the test assesor show as something special.

switchboard defender, which can answer questions about why they switchboard did what it did
switchboard ui but can also be a chattable agent

add dumbbot.

upsert agent needs to check if the agent is correct

switchbot should be able to absorb calls, like when it gets told about how the user wants to use a specific bot, it should not say anything, but should simply prime up with the selected agent and pause, awaiting the instructions from the user.

? how to do the iterative loop of improvement to some files, rerunning tests, then ultimately committing and reverting the tests ?
Sounds like a horrible time where our tools are buggy, but as they stabilize they get better.

Make an example config that shows everything possible.
Make a tool to check the config has been set correctly.
Agent writing tool, so that when it writes the file, it checks to see if the format is correct, and passes back any errors.

Check the test files to ensure they specify valid agents, and that their config is structured correctly.
Strip out the assessor requirement.

Function to list or browse isolates.  Possibly in a widget for navigation.

Agent display panel that honours front matter or yaml.

File explorer and editing widget.

Using the test workbench bot, fork a new test branch in which to make modifications to agents in isolation.  These modifications can be chatted up or manually edited using a widget.  The changes can be run and chatted with as tho they were the primary thread.

The workbench can call the test controller to run tests that exercise the test branch files.  The workbench examines the results, navigates thru the test runs to see every message that occurred, then modifies the sandbox in the test branch and rerun the tests.

Add descriptions from the agent descriptions.

Add a youtube player stateboard item.
