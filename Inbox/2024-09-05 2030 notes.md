file creation and stuck creation in the message as a dedicated ui element.

drill down into the test runs, so use can browse the outcome.
Make a widget that shows what the conversation looked like.  Make the test assessor show as something special.

switchboard defender, which can answer questions about why they switchboard did what it did
switchboard ui but can also be a chattable agent

switchbot should be able to absorb calls, like when it gets told about how the user wants to use a specific bot, it should not say anything, but should simply prime up with the selected agent and pause, awaiting the instructions from the user.

? how to do the iterative loop of improvement to some files, rerunning tests, then ultimately committing and reverting the tests ?
Sounds like a horrible time where our tools are buggy, but as they stabilize they get better.

Make an example config that shows everything possible.

Check the test files to ensure they specify valid agents, and that their config is structured correctly.
Strip out the assessor requirement.

Function to list or browse isolates.  Possibly in a widget for navigation.
When browsing, execution is possible too, optionally in a branch.

Agent display panel that honours front matter or yaml.
Markdown tool should show frontmatter as separate, in pre blocks.
Agent display tool should resolve all links, and maybe highlight them.

File explorer and editing widget.

Using the test workbench bot, fork a new test branch in which to make modifications to agents in isolation.  These modifications can be chatted up or manually edited using a widget.  The changes can be run and chatted with as tho they were the primary thread.

The workbench can call the test controller to run tests that exercise the test branch files.  The workbench examines the results, navigates thru the test runs to see every message that occurred, then modifies the sandbox in the test branch and rerun the tests.

Add descriptions from the agent descriptions into switchboard.  How should this be inserted ?
Can create a function to read this in from all the agents whenever the switchboard runs ?
Can cache it against the hash of the agents directory so it doesn't need to run every time ?
Or just rely on caching in the deployment to bring this down.  Could be a link to a function, so we can link to an isolate using the isolate protocol, and the output of that function will be inserted into the file every time it gets loaded ?

Add a youtube player stateboard item. 

Seems we need a way to navigate branches, and the dispatch actions into them.

Make the target be treated like a deferred thread, which is run as long as no indication of escape is given.
