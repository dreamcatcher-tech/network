If a user can be shown that they can submit their problem, it gets written nicely for them, and the AI validates that it is a legitimate problem, then they can feel heard.

Further, we can generate an NFT for the problem if they want, and this is a permanent record of their contribution, and funding can be put against making this thing work.

Letting them hold these things gives them a sense of belonging.

Getting contributor shares on other problems that they added too helps as well.

Any time a major event occurs on a token, the current DC ledger is used to update the NFT.
