Providing a good large scale and cheap scraping API should be trivial in dreamcatcher.

The benefit is that we can allow anyone to inspect the strategies we use, and let others sell their own improvements and strategies, and let anyone make their own.

These are ranked and benched, and can be easily benchmarked, regularly, against your specific task.

This cheapness, customizability, transparency, and opening of the innovative edge by sharing payment amongst innovators should see us lead, and self fuel to stay there.

In some cases transparency means websites can resist quicker, but strategies can be closed source and behind and API.

data sovereignty guarantees for all actions too.

The tracing of the actions would be available to all devs but also to all users, if devs want, so that it is easier to debug, and users can get involved and customize further.
