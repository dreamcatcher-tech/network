By using snapshot ids and knowing how to compute diffs rapidly, we can make a viewer that is aware of the process branch structure.

Can show which branches changed between executions, show the transmissions occuring at each one, can run the microloops, which were execution strobes that occurred between large commits.

Maybe edit and alter the results ?

Can see the transmission pool at every step, and can step forwards and back in bulk and for microticks and focusing on a small number of processes.

If you alter the actions, these too can be rerun, and the results compared.
