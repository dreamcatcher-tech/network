Sol suggested that we go on upwork and outbid people on dev jobs.

Can find good jobs, respond before anyone can say anything, and then deliver something in a day or so.

This can be a good test of how the dreamcatcher framework can be used by businesses, and a good adoption path.

Make a metric for devs out of work per second.
