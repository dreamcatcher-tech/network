The idea is that for each specific cheat sheet, we can develop techniques for analyzing a codebase so that we can ensure that the security parameters specified in the cheat sheet are being correctly mitigated.

This more specific way where each strategy is designed to test these faults is a more nuanced approach to just simply asking the bulk question. We could also eval against sites that have been found to have these vulnerabilities or failures for which the cheat sheets demonstrate an issue and they can test the detectability of the application of our strategies.

Now we could also try and run the inverse, which is where a program tries to code in faults that the cheat sheets highlight and to make sure that we are detecting them properly, like an adversarial game. Adversarial games and getting good scores in them give us an extra feeling of safety. That the frontier models can't be used against us to overcome our current use of whatever models we are using.
