The more we can be vague at the top and just say what you want the better the flop will become. It's almost as though the more details you provide about the things you need the better it will reconcile them all together. It's hard to get it to incrementally move towards something if you allow it to flop at the start, it seems somehow better. 

Each iteration should pick up the small faults first, before attempting the bigger ones, otherwise it will amplify the smaller faults.
