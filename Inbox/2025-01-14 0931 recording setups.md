Working with just a shared browser, we could stream just that ?

Immersed seems better as just gives us monitors.

whatever screen is being shared with others should be captured.

But almost like we need to be looking at an independent browser window that represents the shared screen in the recording setup.

So if we had a purely browser based setup with a shared browser window, then we have that showing the shared video stream of each person, then in VR we both can see a common thing, but it is also recorded as part of the recording track.

The webcam might be used from the view of each of us ?
