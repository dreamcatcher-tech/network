If a project fundraises using tasks, and those tasks become valuable, then people looking to gain exposure to such a thing can buy into a pool of such tasks.

This would be pool that takes in funds that go and purchase these NFTs using some kind of external appraisal mechanism to ensure a fair price was paid.

Then the pool token could be traded openly.  Forms a generic and non participatory wrapper around the NFTs, which require considerable knowledge to pick and aquire before a revenue stream is decentrally allocated to them.

This can be run as an uncontrolled smart contract, and so the price and profit can never be expected from the efforts of any 3rd party.

People who own task NFTs can put them into the pool in exchange for some tokens in the pool.  Pricing is goverened by the pool algo.  You are surrendering the royalty payments to the pool.  You get back a voucher that lets you get back your NFTs if you give back the tokens you got, or their equivalent.  The price may have gone up.  Only you can redeem them back out tho.  While they are there, all royalties go to the holders of the pool.  You can sell the NFT that gives you withdrawl rights too.
