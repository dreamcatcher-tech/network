If a project fundraises using tasks, and those tasks become valuable, then people looking to gain exposure to such a thing can buy into a pool of such tasks.

This would be pool that takes in funds that go and purchase these NFTs using some kind of external appraisal mechanism to ensure a fair price was paid.

Then the pool token could be traded openly.  Forms a generic and non participatory wrapper around the NFTs, which require considerable knowledge to pick and aquire before a revenue stream is decentrally allocated to them.

This can be run as an uncontrolled smart contract, and so the price and profit can never be expected from the efforts of any 3rd party.
