If you wanted, you should be able to control your relationship here, and then point at another hoster to do a migration.

The UI would then either, auto detect which hoster you were with, or the hoster provides the UI.

Moving hosters would give you options to run split across several hosters, or pick a full blown chain as a hoster.

Can change hoster for some repos ?
