We should be able to model a statechart within a blockchain, so that no matter where in the application anyone is, we know they are restricted by a model that we have exhaustively tested.

So if there were always two base views: a statechart governing the app, and a commandline interface, then anything that gets made on top can be assured to be operating correctly.

Plus integrators can understand how our system works better.
