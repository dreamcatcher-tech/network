there is a choice point as to which way to go.

1. the current dreamcatcher.ai setup, which doesn't work for dynamic tool calls without a lot of panelbeating
2. the current use-mcp.fly.dev that does do dynamic mcp tools but is pretty bare bones
3. the codex-cli, which I can patch to do sort of whatever we want, but it runs in a cli on your local computer, with the next move being to make it run on the artifact system

so we have artifact that can run arbitrary remote code, but we also have a codex sandbox that could do the same by just installing it on a slice of disk and running it.

then we have mcp being used for dynamic tooling, but needs an agent that has long horizon ability.
