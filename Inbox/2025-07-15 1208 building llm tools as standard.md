immediately the project can be scaffolded, and some baseline tests established that ensure it is always an llm tool and can be called correctly.  Then we can auto generate some evals, for examples of when we would want to call it, and we can generate some synthetics.

Work hard on the synth and curate it, then set it up to go solve for making the evals pass.
