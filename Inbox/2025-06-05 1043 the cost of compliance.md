if binance aus has 3 compliance people, and swiftx has 70 and is still not compliant, and binance is a bigger company, then there is a market for a purely AI based compliance company ?

if we were the money gate, then we can just sell that on to existing companies, and make our own businesses that use this whitelabelled product.

We would have a tiny head count, and be refining the agentic processes to be compliant, and we would sell the liability - we guarantee that we are compliant, and you pay for that guarantee.
