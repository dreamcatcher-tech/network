why can't we do an actual git merge, rather than copying the files over from the mw branch ?
If there is not any write back to moneyworks, then a straight up clobber is fine ?
also for the sake of speed ?
So we only need to find the conflicts, if any ?


probably the main thing is to connect up the front end, and see if we can look inside the data.
Even just as a file browser, that would be very useful.


So get diffs working, then get reconcile to work efficiently.  Try strip a bunch off since no longer doing sync.

can we move the reconcile functions to be server side napps ?
