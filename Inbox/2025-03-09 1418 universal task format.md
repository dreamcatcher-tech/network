If we got this schema set up, we could start using it ourselves for our own projects and have the bots keep it up to date by us having a chat with it and by analyzing the repositories to see what it was we did and how the tasks relate. 

This format would be naturally able to be NFT'd very trivially and can have arbitrary amounts of data attached to the tasks. 

Then we can make a little display widget that shows these tasks, because they are in a JSON schema format, can show them in a Gantt-like view. 

We can eval another system that can look at the git commit history of a project and can attribute tasks based on a set of rules of how you identify commits vs what tasks they're on. It could reconcile the differences between folder naming and task naming and it could manage all that kind of thing. 

What this means is that we can also start to calculate velocity and we can be able to broadcast to people the status or where we're at. They can see when a deviation or an error has occurred since last they looked, because now we're burning effort that's gone off-peak, and they would be able to see direct effort by individual, which is always sort of good to see 

So it's basically making a form of MS Project where the tasks themselves form a marketplace where each task is independent and can be funded and done by a decentralized pool of people. 

The project can also be chatted about, where advice and other types of conclusions are drawn. We would have bots that are specialized in being able to help answer those questions. We might add some graphing modules in there for tools that people find useful for statistical analysis or accounting purposes, etc. 

It's basically a standard way to make a decentralized project plan where the project plan is multiverse-capable - it's made for having multiple alternate paths to be considered routes to be taken. It's able to be decorated with prediction market data, it's able to have funding attached to it, and it can handle attribution for who did the contribution as well as make sure that the specification of the task meets a certain standard. 

Critically, the gatekeeping function of is this task done or not can be assigned to an AI to assess. This means that completion can be escrowed against what this AI says. If the AI is run in a decentralized way, then that means that the project funding is now decentralized, and we can have labor or tasks be undertaken that would typically fall into the realm of the Securities Commission. They are now possible to pursue under the safe guidance.
