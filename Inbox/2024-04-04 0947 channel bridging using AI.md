Trying to do straight copy paste relaying between all channels is pointless.
Instead, if a body of knowledge was updated by inducting comments from all channels, and models of each person is made that shows what they said, then we can allow people to view a summary, and dig down into the sources of information.

AI opinions can be compiled for each person, based on what they said, which they are welcome to come and alter / correct.

Unsummarized text is not much better than the stone age.

Basically just induct info from all channels, and move a corpus forwards.
