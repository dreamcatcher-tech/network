Can provide software based switch that can have multiple peers all connected thru.
We can then form little cut of networks and watch the behaviours of agents as they discover each other and proceed to continue modifications in the app.

Then let them rejoin, with a known conflict, and watch them reconcile their differences.

We can use the 777 protocol to do in memory connections, then show multiple windows.
Or use webrtc with local connections to go between iframes ?
Or some kind of message forwarding thru iframe messages.
