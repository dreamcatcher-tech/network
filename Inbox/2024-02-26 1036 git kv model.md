Each repo branch should store its commit hash along with its lock.  This would take on the functionality of `refs/heads/*`. Means all objects are deduplicated by content.

```js
const tipKey = [ 'COMMIT', account, repository, branch ]
const value = { 
	commit: 'a8f9g434bc348', 
	timestamp: 12341234, 
	output: [9,3,4],
	input: [3,8,5]
}

const objectKey = [ 'OBJECT', dir, hash ]
const value = { data: UInt8Array[], referenceCount: 3 }
const refCountKey = [ 'REFCOUNT', dir, hash ]
const value = 4 // could be the repo that references this

const lockKey = [ 'LOCK', account, repository, branch ]
```


Then all objects inside a given repo are prefixed with the repo.

But we should store objects globally, along with a refcount so we know when they can be deleted from the kv.

Prolly only want to push from the main branch, for which we can keep a memfs snapshot in place, or generate it on the fly.

We would need our own custom fsck type of operation.
