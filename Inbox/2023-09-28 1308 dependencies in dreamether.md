links using chainId: blockHash: nftId

Ultimately once our chain is running, NFTs will be represented by a hash alone, independent of any chainId.  They can have a chainId too, but their hash alone will be enough, since they are a chain unto themselves, and so they are truly independent, and floating.

We can then bond them to popular blockchains using a special kind of QA contract.  This contract can do accelerated timeouts, so on Ethereum the state is reflected truthfully if a change happened on the Dreamcatcher.

Want the dreamcatcher to refer to the chain.  The dreamcatcher is the public chain.  DVM is the target architecture for running code, and it runs in any language so long as it results in json.

We could set the timeout based on the QA selection, so this can be changed per QA, not per packet.
