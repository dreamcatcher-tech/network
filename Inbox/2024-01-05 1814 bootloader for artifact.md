We somehow need to make a bootloader like LILO that turns on the lights and makes the first things work.

It will probably have a connection to a default AI and then can load up more elaborate versions.  It would also boot up a shell so that commands could be issued, an might provide some basic primitive commands for filesystem manipulation and recovery.
