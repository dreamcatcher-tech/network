detect when we get a bad result.
thumbs down moves you to the stuck bot.

a few key words about what went wrong, and then it starts working to fix it, then reruns the output until it is right.  Can work across multiple complaints you've had to incorporate everything you've ever said.

Reruns and evals the prompts right in front of you.

Detects later runs that might have been erroneous.  If it detects a fix that is currently in progress, it can talk about that thing, or it can join you in to it.  That should feel good, knowing that it was already working on something for you.

It would then make more examinations from all other responses, and plays around seeing if some subtle changes would make broadly more acceptable outputs.

Then it would present back some prior examples, or some totally synthetic examples to highlight the point, and might ask the user to confirm which one they like or not ?
