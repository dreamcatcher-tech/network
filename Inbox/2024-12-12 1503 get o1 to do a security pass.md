Seems like there are some standard tricks to get it to focus harder on some things, or pay attention to detail better ?

If we get it to enumerate all the security flaws it knows, or to get it to give us some lists to go fetch.

Ask o1 for a list of standard exploits, then get it to look for each one on a given codebase.

If we give it base info, this seems to strengthen its resolve, or narrow its focus somehow.
