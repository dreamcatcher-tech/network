If we set up in switzerland, or were ready to list in the USA, then we could fund against our own NFTs, and we could fund against a token or our own, or trade in it.  Plus if we had attribution tokens, or AI valued assets, we could trade those and use them to pay for development.

A market cap on our token is far greater than a public company market cap.  The pubco will deflect attention.  If the valuation of all the attribution that we tracked as our cap, that gets the message out that THIS is the place for ambient attribution.
