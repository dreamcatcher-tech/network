If we have some files that we always want in the chat, so it gets loaded as part of the system prompt, this is separate from the dynamic files that a human is adding in there.

Whenever people use the system, our help bots should look at it and offer helpful suggestions on the side, with some quantifications about why, like how they ran your query on the side with the settings different and here's the result.

Getting people to rapidly figure out how to use something seems critical.
particularly if it has a lot of options.
But if everything is always available in chat, and agents are trying to help you.

agents should be trying to help each other, too, so if one agents suggests to another how it could be better, then the bot might be forced to upgrade, so it performs better next time.
