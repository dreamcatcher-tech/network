if operator could be told to walk an app and compile screenshots of everywhere it can get to, then these can be fed back in to o3 to determine suitable coding ?

can have separate passes that check for mobile rendering.

can also give operator tooling to pull out actual dom so that can be passed on too, as well as a screenshot.  we should be able to copy this tool from bolt.

use a headless browser to navigate around and conver this to screenshots.

can show a human a live streaming feed of this ?

then get o3 to check if the views mirror its instructions of what the app needs to be, and see if it needs to update its guidance.
