We must, because we want the workspace to be virtualized too.

we would use lmdb versioning to ensure that only one process was running at once ?
or just use the lock effectively ?

somehow use ai to make decisions on edge cases and errors ?

we would probably use the gitoxide rust crate to virtualize the filesystem using lmdb, then just allow the regular git command to operate.

we would start a repo already checked out, and so we would make modifications to the .git folder to make it magically aware of what's been done.  this is probably as simple as writing an index file out.

this basically gives us near instant checkout.
base index is going to have to be stored on the server to make it quick next time.

or just have git hooks which are installation wide.
