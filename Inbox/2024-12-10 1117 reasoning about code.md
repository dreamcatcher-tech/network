The prompt revisions are actually the spec.

So the job is that o1 should be able to generate from spec alone, where spec would include some reference files.

May make a concat tool that can expand out links in the top level spec, so it can be linked to other data.  Might allow linking to jsr packages to pull in remote reasoning info.
