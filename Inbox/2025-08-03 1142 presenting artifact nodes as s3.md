we could offer a web service, like s3, with some intelligent NL managed features, like when to move storage around.

so we could start to offer services that were integratable using LLMs, where the management layer was a chat, and you could have this llm managing your app back end config.

it is the helper and the doer, recommending best practice.

captures your intent in NL, rather than attempting to present a config that lets you express what you want, it helps you discover what you want based on what it can do, and it remembers rules in NL.

we could use the artifact consensus over storage to present an external s3 compatible interface, and have some extra features like callbacks or event notifications.
additionally, this service could be hosted in a hybrid setup, and could be migrated between different hardware easily.

we could effectively present all of AWS's features but backed by artifact nodes in consensus, which is roughly what AWS is doing anyway, since underneath it all, they have computers.

can internally move data around to provide low latency or resiliency.
can use LLMs to configure this back end service, and to auto tune the setup.
run hybrid, with some on your machines, and some on others.
makes a drop in replacement for existing apps.
make a passthru service where it pulls in existing s3 bucket data dynamically as it is accessed, or it begins the migration and allows live usage during this time.

can be optimized for very small reads and writes too.
buckets might be subpartitioned, so a particular folder is a single repo, rather than the whole bucket being a repo.  so if a users data had a particular prefix, this is moved around differently than another users data.

seems like the critical piece is consensus, that allows us to present a swarm of nodes as a single node.  this is what makes the virtual server be strong.  And so anything you can do with the api of a single node can now be done with this reliability property, as well as a distribution property so it can be closer to you.
