Maybe how we can help the SEND scene is by helping all these little efforts have a home and be able to trade / operate both alone and together.

Make it so individuals can set up ventures very quickly with no overhead, and can work together without having to fight over shareholdings.  A little profit is a dangerous thing, as then people fight a lot over shares, rather than being able to have it worked out later by a system they trust.

That seems like the best service we can be to the SEND effort.

Building tools to help people coordinate.

Or we are a tech collaboration, where we use the dreamcatcher gateway as our entity.
