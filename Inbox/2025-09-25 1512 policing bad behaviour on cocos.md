we could audit the storage of any coco by way of running a data auditing coco that could process every image, or every piece of data, and could recognize bad images or bad documents, without disclosing what those were.

it would be able to badge a data structure as secure, when we badged the auditor, and the auditor runs and badges the hypercomputer.

it could have a grey mark where there are parts of the system that it doesn't understand, like they're encrypted, or suspicious, or something.

so you can be completely confidential, but you confidentially run, with correctness guarantees, and auditor coco, and the run of that computer, assures everyone that you are clean.

this can enable you to trade with others who are also clean.

could be used for copyright material detection.

can be run in realtime, so you are continually being checked, and continually badged.

a virus checker could be running in this manner, and it has the power to do its own analysis and dissection of data, without leaking anything.
