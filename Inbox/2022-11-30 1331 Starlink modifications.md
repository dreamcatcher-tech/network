## Teaming
Be able to have multiple starlinks team their connections to allow a huge burst speed.  They would all connect locally using wifi links, and could enable users to gain large aggregate bandwidth if nobody else was using the links.

Sell this at a per GB/s type of fee.

## Relaying
If a given terminal cannot reach the constellation, it may mesh to others which provide it data.   Anyone on the mesh that has a conventional net connection can sell this access to the others.  

## Relaying between phones
If the phones had low latency relay capability, then they can help other phones reach their destinations.  This would enable mesh.  A protocol needs to be developed so that the relay begins before the packet is fully received, or even before the bit is received.  

Basically N hops should make nearly no impact on the latency of the system.  Being able to change the path midway thru a transmission should be easy, since every device should help boost the signal at that particular frequency.

So your phone can earn credits for you while it sits on standby.  Because of its low latency it can act as an edge server.
