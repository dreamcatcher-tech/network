Making a panel that is editable is a huge pain and fiddly for users.

Instead we should let them select areas of the panel and then enter text in the prompt, so they can be asking questions about it, creating queries, or updating it.

In the table selector, let you select individual rows, or filter a selection, and then say "delete all these customers"

So the selection of the list needs to be showing above the prompt every time.
