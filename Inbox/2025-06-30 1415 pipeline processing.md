when a research agent is hauling in material that might get included, something else looks at the queue and does deduplication, to ensure that the queue is not being wasted.

then it works its way thru the queue and builds up the knowledge base for a particular task.

these little curated packs or manuals are used as source reference material in preference to web pages.

it's like our own little wikipedia.
