If a company already has their workloads as AWS Lambdas, then they are already paying per function invocation, and already paying for someone to monitor their functions infrastructure.

They are not able to purchase guaranteed function times and targets, but we could offer that.


So offer the service that we take those functions and run them on our infrastructure, with performance based payments - like guaranteed API response times.
We tune up the functions to perform better.

Where we want to get to is a shared infrastructure model - not just sharing CPU but also coding skill.  So if all of us have a dependency on this on piece, we all pay a portion of our yield to this thing, then when each of us improves something, we all pay each other.  So we can do a small amount of work, that benefits us, and also gain the benefit payments of everyone else.  So the arrangment isn't us and them, but rather is supplying coding effort when it suits us, so that when it doesn't suit us, someone else supplies it.
