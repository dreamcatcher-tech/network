like pricespy, but for anything you want, and the browsing happens on the fly.
Use hints from a community, as in what pages to go to and what prices to look at, but the browsing is driven by the user themselves.

Some providers can give a direct connection, making switching in and out trivial.

Seems better if each actor has their own personal comparison tool.  That tool also should be independent.
If a provider can be intelligent enough to be haggled with, then they can likely win more business, due to turnaround time, and being able to compete constantly.

Also allow highly customized situations, so special conditions that give a person better treatment than they would ever get.

Why can't insurers just be honest about the things that make it expensive ? like be transparent ?
