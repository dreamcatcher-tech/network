what we are trying to do is get an agent to fire up, with a default face, and then be able to create another agent, start a face, or interact with its default face, then treat it like a worker.

1. create other agents
2. start faces on them


boot sequence:
1. webserver boots
2. reads the agent config file to figure out default faces etc
3. starts the codex face, which presents a ttyd server as well


browser requests come in to that default face.


the proxy service needs to be moved to the main web server, and the default path is to proxy to the ttyd face that has started.

Easiest thing to do is to get one face to call another face on its own self.
may forbid deadlock where it can call its own self and wait on itself to reply, stalling forever.
