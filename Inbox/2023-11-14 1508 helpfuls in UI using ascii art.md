Take a screenshot of the UI at any point, and then convert it to an ascii art form, so we can display it in the chat and have it describe the app.

If we are describing the 3 app UI, then we should be able to store an image in the system as an example.

We could populate this example using the text in the current context.

Show the example in the stateboard, so that we can label things by drawing over the top of the stateboard ?

Could make parts of the UI flash when it is talking about them.
