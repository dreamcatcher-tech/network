with humans involved, probably some have taken bribes to disclose info to launderers.

if we had an exchange that was fully transparent and run by ai then we could be provably incorruptible, provably fair, always nice to clients.

non automated exchanges have to cut costs which means they can spend less effort looking after each customer.

our overheads would be the lowest in the business, and so our fees could be too, as well as our speed, and the quality of care we give our clients.  Plus we are compliant.
