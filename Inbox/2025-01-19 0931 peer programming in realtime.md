It would be great if, while I'm editing a file, other edits by other people on similar files or even just similar algorithms can be presented to me live, particularly I would want to know if people in my friend's swarm were focusing their attention on these files, or if the agents that my peers had commissioned were currently focusing on these files. I should be able to see why, maybe it helps me.
