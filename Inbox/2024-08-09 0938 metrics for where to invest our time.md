Be able to express the pijul task in terms of its benefits and costs.

Will save us $x per month in usage.
Save y ms per commit.
save z MB per month which is b% of current total.
cost estimate x
upgrade requirements - db conversions (some other kinds of upgrade would be seamless)
timeline is y
usage / attribution score 15% of current - says how much the usage would likely be included in the royalty calculation
increase in usage - estimate how many more people would pay to use the system if it was cheaper due to being more efficient.
Map this against changing prices of data storage projections.
net dollar increase - show that if it gets cheaper, more people use it, and then we get more money since the high price is holding back mass adoption.

Then go raise some funds for each packet of change we want.

Compatibility loss nill.
Time to git commit might be slightly higher.

Same with the B2 project.
adds some latency, saves huge money, adds a capability to store large files, lets people download large files without hitting the expensive kv store.
