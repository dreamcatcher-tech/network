These could be part of our subscriptions that offer context grabbing ability at near cost, so that you can burn tokens on it, again at near cost, so that we can benefit from the capability, and the broader deals, and the marketplace of services where people agree to do things for other people, or trade assets, or commission work, and we get a cut of this - a cut of the growth energy expenditure, not just the done work.

The done work is useful but a bit stale, and it slows down new work if you're charging for old work.  Growth is about new.

Generating and holding private and / or large context and processing it efficiently.

> The software should be entirely free, the tokens near free, but the trade that is faciliated should be skimmed
