If I can remove this thing, and use an AI powered speech recognition tool with reasoning capabilities, then I can save myself an immense amount of time.

I should be able to keep notetaking, but it would be handled by a voice recognition system, possibly with whisper and other things, and also taking in to account context.

Be nice to have a single input channel / view, and then it will switch around as I start talking and mention the context, so it will attempt to pull up previous tasks that I was working on.
