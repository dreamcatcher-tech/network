In wikipedia, there is a [list of fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies)

It would have helpful to have an always watching AI agent that would try to detect fallacies in my thinking when I communicate, and save up these summaries, so it can start to reason with me about these fallacious ways of thinking and talking.

It should listen in to my conversations and also the conversations of others to point out errors in those around me that I will gleefully relay to them.
