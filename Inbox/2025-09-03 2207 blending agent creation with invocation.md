we should be able to do this in one move, otherwise have to deal with creation separately.

1. create agent
2. scale agent
3. invoke on agent
4. continue on agent
5. create and invoke

sync means go until complete, and only then return ? possibly with progress streaming back ?

when can you stop an agent ? what if it was running a task for you ?
