In a public chain who's purpose is to sell compute capacity to consumers, the consensus of the top level chain can be upheld by the weight of the transaction going in.

Someone spending a large sum of money, or supplying a large amount of computer has more interest in maintaining order than those who are idle, and so if they assert what HEAD of the top level chain is, this can be used as a reference for everyone else.

Individuals can make their own decisions based on the data and the algo they employ to assert what HEAD actually means.  Truly authoritative is impossible, but 'according to those I trust' is definitely possible.  And if you can know that their incentives are for correctness and they are disinterested in you, then the system can become highly trustworthy.
