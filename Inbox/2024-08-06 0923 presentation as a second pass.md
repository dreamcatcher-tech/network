Upon discussion with SM, rather than using modular prompts, we should do a second pass presentation transform that allows each org and user to transform the output of a given agent to a form that suits their individual preferences.

Show the user the first pass prompt directly, then show that we a re-presenting it, then collapse away the raw prompt and show the represented result.

Shows output as quick as possible, but allows a more refined, more aethetically pleasing result.
