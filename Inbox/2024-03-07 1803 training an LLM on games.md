If we make the games have a text interface first, and all actions are just going via this text input, then we can generate data that the LLMs can be fine tuned on.

So we can exercise them and compare / rank outputs, so they can work towards having a good outcome by being shown huge numbers of examples.

Can use multiple LLMs, where we might train one directly and use gpt4 to get next move recommendations from this assistant LLM.
