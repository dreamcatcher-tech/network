We can use patch as a means of allowing a tenderment consensus algorithm to more rapidly reach an agreement because they are not trying to find a single path to the end. They're only trying to find a single path for dependent changes. And so if data structure is arranged in a way that utility can be found in a minimally conflicting way between participants. Then we can allow the system to consensus faster because these individual processes Alright. Able to be run-in parallel so long as there's no Dependency overlap. And so the algorithm would then be running in multiple realms. As opposed to a single one.

We could then draft a email to Pijul explaining what our use case is where we're using the patches to to have a more rapid consensus algorithm for a distributed data system That and show them how they could make their next version of the nest rum In this way, which might cause him to modify the design slightly to fit this use case. And also, maybe start to use our systems to build on and possibly use the requirements management pieces plus the bounty system.
