Use cron on a separate deno deployment, which runs a series of test functions on our installation, then updates the status log every minute.

If it was blockchained then people couldn't lie about it.

If it was run externally then it shows good reliability.

What would a statuspage napp look like ?

Do napps need cron specifications ? is cron an api gateway call ?
