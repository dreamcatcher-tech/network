If every programmer and user can now construct applications by chatting with an AI builder, then we should design apps that are easily modified in this way - where modification by the user is part of the normal operation.

If the testing regimes were made so that the AI could not make faulty items.
A framework can be made that is better suited to AI using it than other types of code.

IF the building blocks are assembled correctly, then the chance of success is greater.

We can pipeline thru generative tools, and spin out to humans if the output is unsatisfactory.  The AI handles the chat and scope part.

Resale of the generated applications should be built in.

Credit to those who trained the AI models should be given.

AI tool to componentize requests and then attempt to deduplicate them across many buyers, so we can focus on high value yield.
