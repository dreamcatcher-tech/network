It should be tiny, and typed possibly.  It should promote building small isolated secure pieces of code that get thoroughly tested by an AI.

If the deno cloud was responsible for running the code, and for the isolation, did memory management, did low latency management, then this could be a much better option for us ?

Certainly seems a quicker abstraction than us dealing with whole machines and using their resources efficiently. 
Downside is the isolate spin up time is behind a network request.
