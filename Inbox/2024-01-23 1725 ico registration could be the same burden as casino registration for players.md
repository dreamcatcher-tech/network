So if we could require people to use the soulbinding service, which is cheap, then we could ensure they are in the correct jurisdictions for ICO participation, as well as for being able to gamble.

Basically if we can assure they can gamble, we can probably be safe in selling them these tokens.  If the token was pure utility, and there we reward bands, like first batch has higher house earnings, etc, we could launch in this incremental way.

Soulbinding can have a revenue share agreement with people that use its services, so they get paid later for keeping upfront costs low.

If an NFT was played thru more, it becomes more valuable, and so founders NFTs start with the played thru flag being high.
