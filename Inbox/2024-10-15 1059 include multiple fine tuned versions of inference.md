These could be wrapped in a napp that knew how to make different api call parameters.

On our platform, it should be possible to call a range of different parameters so you can rapidly see the effect of changing a certain slider.

Then present this back as a kind of pseudo slider, so you can see the generated results from saved runs and compare them whenever the slider moves.

The power of our tooling is :
1. running multiple parallel variations to rapidly converge on a solution
2. caching the results for retrieve

Additional sugar is to apply intelligence to generating instructions, such as image prompts.

Being able to include rapid changes to api and custom fine tunes easily is key, with near zero setup, and no coding.

Later, doing refinement loops by recognizing the result and improving it successively.

So it should be easy to present a way to showcase all the variations of a fine tuned model, and call on them in parallel, or directly.
