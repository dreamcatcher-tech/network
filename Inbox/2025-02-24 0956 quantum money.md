In a way, you’re building a “negotiation engine” more than a currency. It’s as if money doesn’t exist until a transaction is about to happen, at which point the system figures out an exchange ratio.

Designing a currency that behaves like a quantum wavefunction—only revealing its exact value upon transactions (ie: measurement) and losing part of its potential in the process.

It basically captures uncertainty and gives it a form of certainty to allow transactions.

This pool can be more useful for spending with.  Becomes kind of like keeping all your money in a vc fund and just spending whatever you need.  The currency is, in effect, the future value of the contributions of knowledge work that are made, which you are trading for assets, services, or others contributions.

Contributions are always in the past.  Their full value is always in the future.  Pain arises from trading them wrong.  Inaccurate trading is loss in the system.  The currency exists to attain fair trading of future value from past performance.

We should be able to map all types of trade.  Also each trade is itself an event that can have some future value, by virtue of it happening.

Stock can be forced to be realized, which can be catastrophic for the future value, but superposition potential cannot be force realized.  Stock acts as a marker for future value and a bridge between realized and unrealized, but it can be forced to have a position by virtue of it being both things.  So it bridges the future and the present.  And because it exists, it is already collapsed in some form.  So we're encapsulating that whole price discovery thing and putting it into the currency itself, rather than making it be external.

A contribution can never collapse down to zero.

Measuring costs money too, since it requires token burn.  That burn outcome is recorded on the ledger, so we know how it made that choice.

We should probably model our systems on quantum, since that is what controls the underlying world.  Currency is inherently unstable and shifts often anyway.

the features are:
1. store of value, to defer trades

Basically if we know the relative value between dimensions, then we can calculate trade as well as attribution.

If all money was calculated like this, then the money disappears, and this system can be used directly.  After all, all trade is barter, ultimately.

Pricing by making the markets transparent means the value is always fair.

Allows things to be more auction based, so that more true value is approached, and more coordinated use of resources.

If agents can decide on transaction go / no go, then the barter and pricing can be negotiated without bothering humans, they just all get the best outcome - better than they themselves could have gotten.

Calculating on the fly is about the same as having an trade market of bids and asks.  Price discovery is dynamic.

Theft and fraud need to go thru the AI engine first.  The engine could run dark, or private, but public trades are run in the clear.

This solves crypto's loss problem.  You can't get robbed directly, since the AI oversaw the changes.  AI censorship by the people choosing the system.

Perhaps we can show how money causes environmental innefficiencies, just because it isn't dynamically adjusting to real world conditions quick enough.

Run the system in small farm communities, so barter on the spot, while the crops are in the field.

The store of value is potential - the currency represents potential, and it is transformed into kinetics by the AI measurement system.

The mint is the act of contributing - it isn't clear what the value of that is, as time will tell.  You can spent the potential future value now, based on some AI rules.

We should make a range of different scenarios of trade, and see how the system responds to each one.  Have backing english reasoning, but also have top level diagrams, that show a users balance.

What would be the overall scalar value of this ? energy ? joules ?  what are the units of contribution even measured in ?  What are the units of measurement for innovation rate ?

They don't have a definite balance, they have a wavefunction - crypto users are used to this concept, since the value of crypto fluctuates so wildly.  Buying in to contribution pools is a more direct gamble on future success than gamling on the tokens, since the tokens are not directly coupled to the project.

you could do a daily estimation of what you could get if you sold everything today, which encapsulates the future value as well.  As the value is more greatly realized, that value can increase.  You can strike higher deals if someone agrees, but the AI provides an anchoring market rate.  So you could see your balance in USD or whatever else you wanted.  It would also account for slippage, or market depth.

The value depends on the worldview / forecast that you subscribe to.
