Ring them, with bulbous dendrils.

The rings represent the scale of the impact at different levels.

Make an AI tool that can generate these crystals from various scenarios.  Makes a 3D viewer that can be reconfigured to handle different points of view.  AI can be used to explore these.  AI answers questions about the crystal, and can talk about how it fits in to the wider landscape, since it represents information, and all that info has provenance.

Actor identification, impact assessment.

Reusability - how much of the contribution is technology vs instance ?  If something can be used elsewhere, then it immediately has a higher impact potential.  Knowledge based impacts.
