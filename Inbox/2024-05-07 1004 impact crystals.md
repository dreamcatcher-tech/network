Ring them, with bulbous dendrils.

The rings represent the scale of the impact at different levels.

Make an AI tool that can generate these crystals from various scenarios.  Makes a 3D viewer that can be reconfigured to handle different points of view.  AI can be used to explore these.  AI answers questions about the crystal, and can talk about how it fits in to the wider landscape, since it represents information, and all that info has provenance.

Actor identification, impact assessment.

Reusability - how much of the contribution is technology vs instance ?  If something can be used elsewhere, then it immediately has a higher impact potential.  Knowledge based impacts.

Sleep quality.

Longevity.

Show some horrible negative examples to illustrate the point - show murder, genocide, theft, and other types of bad thing to show the impact along the way.

Show merging crystals - an event in isolation vs in combination with everything else a person has done.

Show chatting with the impact, since it represents information.

Anytime we hear anyone talking about any impact other than money, we should try capture it in one of our dimensions.

Return forecasting, so describe some scenarios, and show how the combined impact that everyone provided is rewarded.  Dial the scenarios up and down to see how the system responds.

Investing is buying impact crystals that do not yet exist.  Craft a future crystal, put escrow funds against it, once something sufficiently close occurs, crystal becomes real and funds are released.

How to express the STC buyers in terms of the impact of all STC activity as well as individual holders and their impact over the time they held the STC for.  So you have an impact crystal proportional to your contributions to the sum STC impact crystal.

Show adding a new dimension and show it rerunning over all the data to regen the crystals, and see progress of it growing during the generation phase.  This is the same as the timeline generation.

Show a timeline tool so the crystal can be scrubbed over a timeline and see how it was at different points in time and see how it changed.  Select a range on the timeline and loop replay just that time to show how a particular sequence of events impacted it.

Make a geometry generator controlled by LLM then allow different viewers to be connected to it.  So can have in browser tooling, but can show them in context of the island. https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_postprocessing_unreal_bloom

The data, the dimensions, the view configuration / mapping info.
Must support conflicting views, and a prediction market for handling uncertainty.

If we had these impact crystals, we can use them to arrange ourselves, seek investment, present our benefits to each other, show how ambient attribution is needed to bridge between the crystals, give those looking for impact investment a stronger tool to communicate what they want.
