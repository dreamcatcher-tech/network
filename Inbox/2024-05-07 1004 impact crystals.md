Ring them, with bulbous dendrils.

The rings represent the scale of the impact at different levels.

Make an AI tool that can generate these crystals from various scenarios.  Makes a 3D viewer that can be reconfigured to handle different points of view.  AI can be used to explore these.  AI answers questions about the crystal, and can talk about how it fits in to the wider landscape, since it represents information, and all that info has provenance.

Actor identification, impact assessment.

Reusability - how much of the contribution is technology vs instance ?  If something can be used elsewhere, then it immediately has a higher impact potential.  Knowledge based impacts.

Sleep quality.

Longevity.

Show some horrible negative examples to illustrate the point - show murder, genocide, theft, and other types of bad thing to show the impact along the way.

Show merging crystals - an event in isolation vs in combination with everything else a person has done.

Show chatting with the impact, since it represents information.

Anytime we hear anyone talking about any impact other than money, we should try capture it in one of our dimensions.

Return forecasting, so describe some scenarios, and show how the combined impact that everyone provided is rewarded.  Dial the scenarios up and down to see how the system responds.

Investing is buying impact crystals that do not yet exist.  Craft a future crystal, put escrow funds against it, once something sufficiently close occurs, crystal becomes real and funds are released.
