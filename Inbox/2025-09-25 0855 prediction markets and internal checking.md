if we let people say how they think others in the team see things, by weighting, this can be illuminating.

but if we also let a bot do this weighting, that could help show people how they are presenting externally.

lastly, if we allow anonymous suggestions, and also gate them using bots that process them confidentially, then we can genuinely get the best information out.  Confidentiality is required to get honest answers, since fear or shame can stop people making the best purest logical decisions.

People are always going to choose the less than optimal path, because they don't want to hurt each other.
