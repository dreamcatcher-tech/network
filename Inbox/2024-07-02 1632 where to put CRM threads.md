These have to be part of the CRM, else they can't merge their changed files in.
Threads would only be allowed to branch off from the base branch, and the thread files have to be in the 'threads' folder, and they can only be started with certain images.

Or we can force them to only start with a single agent, and inside that agent we can invoke new bots in the session ?

Or, the users backchat creates new bots when required ?
Sessions could be organized by actor that created them ? or at least that info is stored in the files.

Can a remote bot have access to the users backchat, but scoped only to things it has control over ?
