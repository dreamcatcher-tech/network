Use a local model to generate transformations of peoples personal data, so that when it gets walked by gpt4, it is not the exact data.  Some data is the same, like addresses, but names are changed to something similar but different.

Email addresses may be replaced with a unique placeholder that is generated in the map.

This mangled data is unencryptable since it is randomized and then stored in a map.
