So fraud is a huge problem for crypto exchanges.  Fraud hurts regular users.  So if we ran a completely transparent exchange, where the fraud prevention was everyones responsibility, and we required everyone to share some data, like what they were doing, and where the funds came from, then reward people to detect fraud on the platform successfully, legit users would come use us and banks would be more tolerant of our fiat activity.

Ran like a coop, where the banking licenses are the property of the DAO.

An AI powered crypto exchange, where the KYC and AML is handled by robots, and the liquidity is assured since it is all on chain.  Then we can lock up assets using our GPU chain, and get huge volumes moving around since it is better to use our system to manage your funds.  Then start trading physical things.

Ensure it is never custodial, where it never holds customer funds.

The banking piece would need to digitize the real world funds using kyc and AML, and then at that point, all the other functions of the exchange can be on chain.

The gateway becomes this simple banking end point, that can also connect with your real banks and orchestrate payments around the place too.

Then we have just AI tools to manage your actions in the crypto realm.  We can be your browser going thru AI.
