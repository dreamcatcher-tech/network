if the computer app was able to replay back to the machines app ?

so why have the computer app at all ?

If the machines were always in a pool, it is significantly cheaper.  and faster response times.

so the computer app would flycast back to the machine pool.

pool would then replay with force instance id on a particular machine.

? what does the computer do at that point, other than store secrets ?
It could do actual monitoring of the correllation between machines and actors ?
