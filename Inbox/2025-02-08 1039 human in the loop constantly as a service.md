Services where human experts are integrated with ai systems.

They can help non expert humans use the systems better, and at the same time they are teaching the system as a whole and earning for it, as part of their equity stake.

This is a very narrow application of the dreamcatcher attribution system, since it is a case where it is needed much more strongly than the existing methods, since people are training something that puts them out of a job, so they want to get something of what they're building.

So in these cases, ambient attribution is a massively better deal than before, plus its a new use case, whereas old arrangements like wages, they don't compete so well, since people are entrenched in the old way, and there is no knowledge or equity creation.

Basically all staff should participate in the sale equity of the company, and they should be seeking to make the company more saleable, more detachable, since they will get a greater equity stake, and this meets the owners goals of selling.
