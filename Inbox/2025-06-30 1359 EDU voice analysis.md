if we are trying to figure out what a child said, then we should send in the audio to the audio model, and get it to determine what words it is saying things close to.

Basically our goal should be to build up a vocab of sounds that are almost like certain things, so we can narrow down snippets, and build up a custom dictionary of child sounds.

Seems useful long term, since getting child sounds is hard to do, so an explicit library, not enough to train on, but enough to RAG on, might be as good as it gets.
