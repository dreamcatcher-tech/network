We need to build a system that can show many theories of improvement being pursued. So if we had some tests, we said why they were failing, we would get O1 to generate some theories to test and approve. We would watch these theories execute. We would sit back from afar and watch a state board dial widget show the changes that are occurring and the success rate in each of these tried theories. If a theory shows some improvement, then it gets included in the base and the process is repeated. If there is a negative, this negative is taken note of and the theories are repeated. We should observe that sometimes having big negatives can come right before having big positives, since being able to move the dial one way indicates or hints at how to move it another way. Ultimately we want O1 to be trying lots of different prompting techniques to automatically make all the tests pass. We don't much care how. Some of these passes can be economic in nature, where we aim to reduce the size of the prompt and the directness of the prompt to still pass all of the tests.
