Things like github offer to be public, but resist offering a download of all the public code they host.

If we had many coordinated accounts, we could all coordinate to pull down, share, and keep in sync, several hundred repositories each, and effectively get back what should be ours.

Also when we do automated PR's, we can include links to our platform, so we try make our platform be canonical, not github.
