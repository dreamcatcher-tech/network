Using the ability to build business systems where things get done once and stay done, to acquire businesses and revamp their processes.  Enhance their profitability immediately, resell the software we develop to their competitors, unbundle their services for independent consumption, acquire their competitors, increase the unbundled effectiveness and software.

Basically go round acquiring businesses, making them superior thru software and API workforce, then also sell the software that we develop for those companies.

Even between companies, this ability can be sold to the company directly, but can be shared between companies that need to communicate with each other in guaranteed ways.

The software shall be free, but the marketplace it enables is skimmed.

Incumbents will never change to our system, since the people at the top would have to give up what they built by force and take what they deserve.  A fair attribution company open to all to improve and benefit from is the final state of any company that fills a demand.

A pubco would make a great M&A vehicle for this.  Pay some standard multiple of profit.
