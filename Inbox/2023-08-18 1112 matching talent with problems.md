Can make a block diagram of all the mechanical pieces that are required to reach a deal in the innovation marketplace.

Agreement on the future payments of royalties is a huge chunk that we can just automate out.

Initially we just offer manual royalty streams to get started, and commitment to use the AI once it is available as the transition conditions.

Can also show the talent search pool, and how it favours locality, and even how it favours nationality by language and banking inefficiencies.

Basically a diagram showing how we approach an ideal marketplace for software innovation.
