Building land development tooling can immediately benefit SI.
If SI is the home base of the software, then royalties paid in to the software would be distributed to the island.

If SCH want land dev tooling, we can build this in collaboration with SI, and manage investment in these tools thru SI.

If the Island acted as an economic entity in the world, then I could run a business as a project within it, and the island would handle all the details.  The DAO is something I could trust, and so I wouldn't need to be a director or trust the directors if I trust the DAO.  This removes the need for a traditional legal entity.  If the AI is handling the compliance and safety of each effort, then the chance of colocation loss is reduced.  Colocation loss can be shared between all so they have a fund like insurance that defends all members collectively. 

So as long as your activities pass the DAO scrutiny and the AI keeps you in compliance, then the DAO will defend you.  Collective defense is cheaper than individual defense.

So, we should set up the legal frameworks and governance to allow remote projects to take advantage of this jurisdiction.  Profit share is apportioned using LLMs.  Some of that goes to the island.  The more we can generate product out of the use cases on the island, the more connections we make, and the deeper the showroom we recreate, the better for everyone involved.

It is of great advantage to be in a tax free jurisdiction, have a physical presence, and a collaborative lab environment.

If people could transfer their revenue generation in local jurisdictions to this other jurisdiction, then there can be significant tax advantages.  This business hosting service, like a cloud provider for your business, is valuable.
