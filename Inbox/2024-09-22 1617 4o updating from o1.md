4o would pass in the full doc read from disk to o1, then receive the response, then merge the response to the file with minimal change.  

The wisdom comes from o1, but the nice shaped response comes from 4o.

So we could use this to edit a doc, where the goal of the doc was clear, and then we can chat about it.  Doc has goals and structure, and these get rippled thru with rearrangements happen.
