Then, each time a system architecture changes, ensure these scenarios can be run.

Match the execution of these scenarios against pieces of the system that have yet to be built, so the roadmap, priorities, costs, and timeline can be estimated and kept live updated.

We can describe the system in terms of blocks / containers of functionality, and so a given scenario can be used to generate what pieces of the system it requires.

The containers can be versioned, so you can say what versions are required for what scenarios.  This is our architecture.  It is live, and it can chat to you, and questions can be posed of it.

Can do the same for SI where the governance is questioned and modelled.
