**Inventor’s Notebook Entry**

**Project Concept:** A unified platform for securely storing personal medical data, financial records, and other private information. It allows:

- Tracking of complete medical histories.
- Asking health-related and financial questions to AI systems.
- Suggesting personalized improvements and advice.
- Sharing specific data with friends, care providers, or financial advisors.
- (Potential) Integration with national medical record systems.
- Monetization avenues through opt-in anonymized data sharing.

**Core Rationale:**

1. Individuals need a single, secure location to manage sensitive data.
2. AI-driven insights should be delivered confidentially for user benefit.
3. Users can opt to contribute anonymized data for the public good or participate in private data marketplaces.

**Technical Outline:**

- **Data Architecture**:
    - Encrypted data storage with robust key management.
    - Role-based access controls for selective sharing.
- **AI Integration**:
    - Localized or containerized AI for on-demand processing.
    - Clear user consent prompts for data usage.
- **Scalability**:
    - Microservice approach for modular expansion into financial health, taxation, budgeting, etc.
    - Potential direct integration with government APIs.
- **Privacy & Compliance**:
    - Meets HIPAA (or local equivalent) for medical data, plus strict financial regulations.
    - Data anonymization processes for shared model training.
- **Revenue / Incentive Model**:
    - Users can choose to profit from contributing anonymized insights to third parties.
    - Tiered subscription plans for advanced AI analysis and specialized services.

**Additional Ideas & Extensions:**

- **Secure Execution Environments**:
    - Use trusted enclaves for all AI computations to maintain data confidentiality.
- **Distributed Ledger**:
    - Immutable record of data sharing transactions for auditability and trust.
- **Preventive Diagnostics**:
    - Integrate wearable data to offer proactive health suggestions.
- **Global Collaboration**:
    - Partner with international organizations for research and cross-border data interoperability.

_Next Steps:_

- Refine user identity/authentication flows.
- Prototype secure AI processing pipeline.
- Evaluate partnerships with national record systems and financial institutions.

Would allow us to have a marketplace of services that are of key relevance.  The more private data they add, and the more AI processing they allow on that data, the more we can avoid advertising misses - the resources they need would be almost exactly

So, advertising, the advertising platform is not really advertising in the traditional sense. It makes its money because the consumers find what they're looking for from the suppliers. So, advertising is in effect a marketplace of services, and yet Google was only able to tap the signaling revenue. What we should really be tapping is the transaction revenue from the system. Is it still advertising if you get it right? So, if we can make a platform that has a lot of private data on it that customers want us to look after for them, they do actually want to be supplied. And so, if we do the introduction, then the supplied transactions feed the platform, so that it keeps doing what it's doing and incentivizes people to make it better. So, the revenue model isn't selling advertising, it's selling introductions or something like that. Is there a nicer way to say that?

Instead of “selling advertising,” call it **curated introductions** or **facilitated connections**—a service that directly brings consumers and suppliers together in a trusted environment. The platform earns revenue from the actual transactions rather than ad impressions, aligning value for both customers and suppliers and incentivizing continuous platform improvement.


raw: Make a Health Records storing platform where people can keep track of their medical data, can ask medical questions and can have things suggested to them, as well as share with their friends. It provides a single place where a complete picture of them is stored, and depending on the level of success we see, we can integrate directly with National Medical Records. Branch out to handle things like financial health and tax data, budgeting, money, all those kinds of things. Because what we're really doing is giving people a central place to store highly confidential information, and then allow confidentially run AIs to process this information to give them advice of benefit, as well as if they wish to opt in to supplying the anonymized data to help improve global health, as well as public good AI systems, as well as getting paid for private benefit systems.
