For the sake of speed, making the browser go thru its home repo before it can send an action to another repo seems pointless.

If the user wishes to keep a copy of the data they are interacting with, then we should allow them to clone the info that has been shared with them.

Partial shares of a repo might be possible.

Then they can send their actions directly into the repo in question, with their home repo keeping a clone in sync with whatever they have access to, which includes the comms branch.

Much cleaner, less RTT, no loss of data.

Allows an actor repo to delegate out its actions to an authenticated browser.
