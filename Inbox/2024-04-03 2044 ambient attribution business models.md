At the macro level, it enables us to implement the business model of getting our users to teach us something, and then selling back a better version to them or others.  Crucially, we share these profits with them, and if we were dreamcatcher from the start, there is no margin to be reserved - its all peer based.

This model encourages people to put their data in, and to teach the machine, and to solve harder architectural problems.

Then, to use distributed resources to incur the cost of training the models on computer, a cost which can be significant.  As well we can have shared attempts at improving the base models.
