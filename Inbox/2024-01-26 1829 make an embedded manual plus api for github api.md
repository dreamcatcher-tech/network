If we generate a large number of phrases that cover things that people would ask of github, then we should be able to do vector search on the api manual and then mess around a bit to ultimately get some changes we want.

Because we can't experimenet like we can in artifact, we have to get it right first time.  This is a fault with conventional systems - too rigid.
