Basically use a cheap camera and motion detection, and when a motion is detected, send it off to an AI model that can say "is this a dog?" if it is a dog and it's on the chair that it's not supposed to be on, emit a high-pitch noise.

additionally, have multiple cameras throughout the house and be able to say at any moment "where is everyone" or "what's the disturbance". so basically the AI processing only kicks in when the dull low-level sensors trigger it and ask for a response.

we should be able to have great gains from integrating increasingly advanced AI models that are very cheap and very fast and can do advanced things like counting people and other stuff like that. all we got to do is provide the platform for it.
