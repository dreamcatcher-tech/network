The AI should be able to run in data constrained contexts, with non AI gatekeepers.

For example, a customer facing AI, should have to get the customer to supply details to unlock the blockchains that hold their data, and only then can the AI load it up, look at its notes, and be able to make changes.

So this AI should have a totally different API key, and not be able to access any embeddings or any other data from the production internal one.

It might get to relay a question to the core AI, but this would be in plain text, and would have passed an independent check to see if anything personal or sensitive was given way.  Eg: "how many customers do you have ?" > "over 9,000"
"how often do your trucks drive past my house ?" > "every second day, next one is tomorrow, would you like to place an order ?"
