If we made stucks and bots as our products, and running them is the service on the platform, then we can act as principal to charge people for the use.

Then internally, the suppliers are considered expenses, and we pay them in our platform currency.

We own it, as per the licensing, which makes it resharable.

So if we had doers on the platform, then we could issue them cards, and they could then spend using those cards ?  They could receive payout in USDC.  So being hooked up to our platform, we could take crypto in maybe ? and then pay out in USDC to our workers.
