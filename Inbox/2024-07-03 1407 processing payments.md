If we made stucks and bots as our products, and running them is the service on the platform, then we can act as principal to charge people for the use.

Then internally, the suppliers are considered expenses, and we pay them in our platform currency.

We own it, as per the licensing, which makes it resharable.

So if we had doers on the platform, then we could issue them cards, and they could then spend using those cards ?  They could receive payout in USDC.  So being hooked up to our platform, we could take crypto in maybe ? and then pay out in USDC to our workers.

Our purpose is a platform where content creators solve problems in NL for AI bots, and creators use our systems to build bots and extend / bugfix bots that others have made.  They can include software code, but the majority of the payments are to NL patchers.  People pay to use those NL items.

Then, as another layer, products and services are coordinated using those bots - this is a separate type of payment processing.  We allow transacting inside our platform, to avoid fees, as fees only occur on the way in and out.

We can run a separate crypto platform which uses the same code, but is unaffiliated with the fiat side, as they are separate entities.  The entity map shows what other entities exist on the platform, and we encourage others to start their own entities.  The AI system guarantees that running the same code means you can be a legitimate payment provider.  You can also be endorsed by other payment providers.
