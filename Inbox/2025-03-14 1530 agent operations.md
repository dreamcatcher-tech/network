Have each agent as an inbox, where all their messages and actions go in, which can be tagged based on purpose.

When we want to spot check them, we can use AI tools to interrogate what they said and then run theoretical changes.

When upgrading, or swapping, we can run the new agent on the prior tasks and check the response, then we can try switching some messages or some roles over to the new agent, until we are confident in its correctness, then eventually take them all in.

Being able to pay people for improvements they made to an agent and chose to share.

Be able to have self sovereign data controls in place at all times.
PR based workflows on all jobs.
Improvement cycles that run over the agents to improve them.

Let people publish their own agents, like apps.

Fabric that allows us to draw on every GPU in the building if we need to.  Also rent those out when not being used.
