Doing farming using robotic control and drones should mean we can reduce the cost of fencing, pesticides, and other types of expenses. With happier animals that are monitored, and with all that data, we should be able to gather insights and optimize where we're constantly running experiments to fit our procedures to the exact land and the exact animals so that our output is optimal.
