Every app should have its model published.
These models should be easily buildable by external viewers.
Votes can be cast as to what is correct.
Agreement at different scope levels can be struck, so as to remain useful even if alignment is not perfect.

Good apps should be aware of their models and should update them with real irrefutable data from their operation.
