If we use nsjail to isolate the process that we are running in, and if we take advantage of the isolation that fly.io grants us inside of the Firecracker VM that we're running, then so long as we make sure we often shut these machines down after a certain number of queries or time, and if we try and keep the function calls related to the same batch of functions or the same branch/domain/repo, etc., so that you know even if someone does breach nsjail, it's not going to gain access to any data that it wouldn't have had anyway. 

sell extra levels of isolation where customers can pay to have their machines run with only their workloads, so that everything's in a private network just for them

We can intercept time and randomness by using nsjail so that we don't have to patch the Deno environment or the Rust environment or anything. We've patched it at the OS source, and so whenever these programs run, they could run repeatably.
