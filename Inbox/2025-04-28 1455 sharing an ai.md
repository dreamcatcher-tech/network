have a toggle where the questions you ask can be seen by the other collaborators.

have a toggle where edits can be proposed to the doc, so as you ask, edits can be auto generated if they make sense, but if you want to make changes you can say that directly.

Makes it like google docs, but you can chat with it, as well as chat with others.

maintain a list of issues with the doc, and common questions.

Goal is to break the knowledge up into a tree of atoms. Allow pointers to other parts of the tree.

See other peoples questions, and have the bot auto flag areas of the doc / fact pool that people are talking about, or points of contention.

Hook up to pipelines, so like a 1 pager, where it is continually updated based on changes and questions being asked.
