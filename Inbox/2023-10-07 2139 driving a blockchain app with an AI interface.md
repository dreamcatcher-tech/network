Even the pricing of the GPU costs would be included in the attribution AI.

Feed back in error messages to the query writer so that it corrects the messages.

A collection of objects can be queried with the mango language.  Without some query language, we would have to run each object thru the 

Then it could make an image representing a chart of the data, which can be drawn as a raw image on the screen.  Or a formula can be written, with error loop feedback, until the image pops up.  Human can tweak with prompt until looks right.

"Can you save that and email it to xyz with a quick summary".

Have direct AI queries that run each one thru the ai directly, for example: "Give me everyone with an anglo saxon name".  These types of query would be totally freeform, and execute knowledge on each one, and then might summarize each one.  It would use the max token window of each call, and chain calls together.  It would limit the number of queries before continuing to reduce the price runaway.  It would be not a query language but a genuine intelligence applied to data.

It would be slow, but it would be glorious to watch.  Regular heavy queries can be analyzed and a more efficient format can be proposed.  This could be an agent running over all the queries that were made into embeddings.

So before getting efficient, we could drop down these slow queries that burn a lot of resource but give good results.  These same AI direct queries could be used for bulk edits too.

In this case being able to snap upgrade the db is very useful, particularly if it only updates on write.

Use the customer records as embeddings so they can be processed directly as knowledge.

Could use tools like grep to do additional filtering on the outputs that the customer wanted.  Can preserve the linkage to the customer in question, and the field in question, so the output should always have a link  back to the source so the user can navigate there directly.

So some tasks would just output a single line, which gpt could ensure was formatted correctly, and then use summarization tools to give the user what they want.  Be fun if they could see this workflow in action.

A database that can be queried using AI only.

Do regression testing where we have a bunch of queries and each time the source prompt changes, we rerun the test queries, and then check if our new result matches or is similar to the previous results, to know if something changed.  Could also run these outputs thru gpt to see if they are materially the same, to save the number of times a human is alerted - can use the cheaper models for this part.

The pubco should particularly focus on multiagent systems.
