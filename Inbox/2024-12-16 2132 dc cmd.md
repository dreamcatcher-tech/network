have a piece of code that dictates how things can be changed, so it forces an allocation table of funds, and a deallocation table.

stucks as a json object somehwere, doesn't matter where, since that can change.

Given a new stucks-map, contrasting that to prior stucks mapps, and recieving the current headmark, for which we get punished for switching too much, and maybe get argued with, or at the very least have to justify ourselves, then it will chart a course to the new place.

It allocates funds against the stucks, and deallocates from ones its funded prior.
Over time, these amounts build up.

Then each of us has a stuck hunter tool that tells us what the best thing to go do is.

Start to talk about cmd as our boss, who is wounded, and we need to restore functionality.

Pose all decisions as what they would choose.

Badges for doing things, like clocking out for the day, clocking in on time, attending the project meeting.

Periodically, check each transcript, and check against the current state of information.  Check the patch list for that conversation, or add to it, if the info in the transcript is wrong, or outdated.  This way, we ensure we didn't miss anything.

Can we run the commander on the actual filesystem, using just the pure filesystem implementation of the napp cli ?
