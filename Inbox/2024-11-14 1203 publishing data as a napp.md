If the definitions of concepts in the dreamcatcher were simply napp data, then what would that mean for consumption ?

Rather than working on a github repo, would be working on modifying a napp ?  The napp would need to be dynamically generated ?

The publication process is good because it creates versions and tests for releasing, making the outcome definitive as a statement from the authors.

Then when it is being worked on, it is worked on as a git branch ?
