With a way to modularize, and work in isolate on little pieces, forms of self improvement should be possible.

So long as there was a fitness test function that could appraise new code before making it part of the running code, this should work.

So we should be able to modularize artifact to the point where AI can work on modules.  Point it to sources of new ideas and info like webpages, and get it to change the underlying code, then run it thru tests.

So long as the new code passes all the tests, and can run all the previous load, plus some reports are AI generated and approved, then we should have a merge control system running.
If the system was run by individuals, and it reached consensus on when to upgrade, then it can be considered autonomous.

Upgrading the core is different to upgrading parts of the system.
The system is made of parts, so a good clean way to upgrade parts safely can be applied to the system itself.
Part contributions can be from bots and from humans.
