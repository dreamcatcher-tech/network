Basically when the maintenance flag goes up, we should take a git dump of everyones repos, and then drop and recreate the db.

Ideally this would happen in cloud, where the next version number pulls up from the previous layer.  This work could be done inside a repo, so we have some traceability.  Should be massively parallel and get done quite fast ?
