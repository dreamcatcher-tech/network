I want to ask questions, then go do something else - the model should keep trying to refine its response until I get back, since it has this grace time to improve.  2 iterations will surely be better than one, particularly if second iterations use memory and rules, rather than poluting the flop.

when a tool call triggers and assistant or an agent, then the agent will be visible going off and doing something, which can be viewed in a timeline.
Show progress like git branches.

This could include fact checking answers, and pulling back responses if discrepancy is found.
