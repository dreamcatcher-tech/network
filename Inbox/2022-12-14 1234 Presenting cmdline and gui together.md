If a backstage view was presented to select which chain to load, then this would select what GUI to display, then load up the components, possibly from off chain.

At this point, a commandline could be selected as the UI.

### Shadow view of GUI
Being able to have a GUI that was driven by the actions of the commandline and viceversa would be useful to present the strong relationship between the two, and show the mental model more powerfully than words could ever present it.

CMD could be running in the trusted page, and reading the chain from an untrusted iframe.

CMD as a dropdown for each instance ?

CMD as an iframe that is slaved to the app iframe by a non blockchain protocol.  Slaved using the complex alone with some hooked callbacks.
