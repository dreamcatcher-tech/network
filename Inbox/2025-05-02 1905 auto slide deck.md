If we knew a customer was requesting the same updated slide deck every year, then we should be able to auto generate it ?

If we had the whole catalogue always in a consumable state, then we could chat up a catalog at any point with no effort.

Can find missing info we need, put in placeholders, and cause it to be created by emailing the people they need it from.

Agents should be able to email workers to ask for help and to get information, as well as to get clarification, approval, etc.

Approval should be just whatever medium those in charge want to use.
