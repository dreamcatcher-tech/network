no doubt they will be thinking how to make a single listing with monetization.

we should make our mcp interface open, let people sign up, and help do payments for other mcp servers, as well as virtual decentralized hosting.

`hotpotato.dreamcatcher.ai`
requires sign up to dreamcatcher.ai to use the tooling.

`mcp.hotpotato.dreamcatcher.ai`
let you connect an ai to the mcp server, but requires dreamcatcher.ai account before logging in.
