If it was all mcp, then the vibe coding and the hosting would all be bundled together, ripping out all the UI frameworks, all the server hosting frameworks that complicate up the app hosting with the app logic.

They become just tiny little mcapps that can be spun up anywhere.  The UI becomes static packages that are easily transported anywhere.

The hardware becomes resilient with the clients being smart to conduct a failover themselves.

Whole stacks just drop off, like vercel and their next behemoth.

But then you don't need to host, really - you just publish and the consumers pay for hosting - this is the key financial paradigm shift - the consumers were always paying for the computer, but now they'll do that for the hosting too.

So consumers need hosting, and they purchase it in elastic amounts, which is much simpler than if the server tries to be elastic.

consumer demand is for static hash stored assets, not for remotely computed dynamic objects.

if we're very much tolerant of servers going offline, then we can save a lot of money - if we are ok with things being repaired next few days, that cuts the bills significantly, since we can axe salaries.

so if we eventually set up ai run datacenters, with no staff, just servers and they sometimes get replaced, that's as cheap as htings can go.

have failover servers that a hot available to take the load.
