When you want a similar task, it should have checked how the current agents were working out for you, and as new ones came on the scene, it should have run them against your old queries, and suggests to you agents that have a better outcome.

User can explicitly say to use a specific one, and it stores a reference to the statement from the user as to why it is doing that.

Contradictions in instructions prompt it to ask for clarification.  Also check for implicit disagreement, where a rule says one thing, but behaviour suggests different.
