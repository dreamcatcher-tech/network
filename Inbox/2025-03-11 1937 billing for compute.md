part of a unified model of computing that we can handle as a blockchain is to be able to build and measure for different kinds of CPU usage. 

I think that we could model fly.io as a blockchain if we considered each component within the infrastructure as an independent source. Each data center would be as though it were an independent source, building the app. We would have adversarial services on the inside that ensure things work as intended. We'd also have things like delayed payouts or reputation scores that incentivize good behavior rather than a trust domain. 

How we bill and the ability to have a currency or value exchange, as well as making each consumption of a measurable unit require some ledger updating. I think this also requires a way to carve off a credit like a dollar worth and then eke away at it over time as multiple small requests for a web server come in. 

We need to be charging not just for events or computation rendered but for qualities of that service such as timeliness how much ram was used how much cpu was used people should also be able to set their own throttle limits based on some pricing as well they should all be standard conformant metrics for which we have developed decentralized ways to incentivize and pull police and slash bad behaviour and so there will be a small number of a standard set of these recognized qualities and then the price is entirely up to the market and from time to time we would need to modify how these measurements occur
