Share stateboard between threads, so we can name our monitors, and the threads know how to project on a given one.

Each one has a managing agent that can attempt to combine things together.

So could throw up lots of threads and then zip around chatting with them.

Have one you carry with you that acts like a navigator, and has a widget to help you.

As you chat, the ones around you move to be more or less relevant.  Lines connect them, and you can tweak the lines to hear why they are similar.

Share them with friends.

Use mic to trigger when you're speaking to a thread - the mic cord auto attaches to the thread you're looking at.

Long running threads can have a light on top of them, so looking at a room full of threads you can see which ones are working and which are done.

The topics of the threads can be determined and grouped together in scenery that relates to the topics.  Generate environments by selecting from auto gen parameters in unreal, and twiddling until the ai thinks it matches nicely.

Set up maps of a city and attach threads to places on the map.  Reference objects in world, and be transported by navigating the thread.
