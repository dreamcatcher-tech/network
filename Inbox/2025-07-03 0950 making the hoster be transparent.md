if we don't start as transparent, then we will never change to be there.

we should be able to use secrets to keep everything transparent except the signing and encryption keys, and expose everything else ?

The actual ids of the repos might need to be kept secret too perhaps ?

altho this might not matter, since it would deny any access to these, beyond the actual listing, so you can't know anything more about them other than that id.

it might lean on the auth provider keeping everything seperate, so the auth provider is a special level that is required to keep everything secret.
