When an isolate requests some other functions, its requests will go into the pool for that branch.  They need identifiers to stop duplications occuring.

This could be nonces generated by the system, but they should be stored stronger than that.  Sending out actions should require a commit.

So this would log that a certain function make a series of requests, it would put them on the IO channel, with the proctype MESSAGE, which is sending messages out to other branches.  It could be reading from the disk.

Function can be kept around and will keep running if possible, but otherwise it can be resumed and will run with the responses preloaded.

It should be resumable at any point in the execution, in case it did much work.

Repeatability is improved if the function makes short steps.
