If registering an attempt was making a branch for this machineId, then writing the data down, we have immediately multithreaded it.

We can also store things in each branch without bothering the base branch.

surrender then goes via the branch which is specific to the actorId, which means we do not need a lookup at all.

Then we can just store the PID of the auth branch to give us access to all tokens for all machines 



Branches give good scale, good isolation between files that have similar purpose but for different people.
