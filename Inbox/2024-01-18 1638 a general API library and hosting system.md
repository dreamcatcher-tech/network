All these GPTs need integrations.
We should make a system where we can securely host and keep your services online.
If we need a new API, we advertise it, and it can be constructed by collaborations.

The format being git based means you can always trace what happened, can run things internally and have them easily hook up to your cloud hosted systems.

The API being made to be AI native and also made using AI inside of it to do much of the logic, plus be repeatable, and have its architecture in natural language means it is far easier to maintain and to fork from.
