Be able to type code, and have a new container get created each time, so that your function is now new.  Means we could dev containers and get feedback instantly.

Hard to beat webcontainer as the way to get instant feedback tho.

However when we want to deploy, we need something heavier, and perhaps an ephemeral lambda can do that.
