left bar is shortcuts to jump to different agents, like home, home + new thread, other common agents.

top bar shows who you are, and who else is in the session.

could also be your tabs ?
so you have one tab per session, and inside each tab you can see what's happening ?
your home agent can see your tabs.
tabs should be handled by the browser.  you should be able to list your sessions in agent, then switch over to them.

down the left hand side is a list of chats that you have been having with different agents, so you can jump between them.

some of the agents know about these chats and can help you navigate them.
