Any repo can give itself a webhook url, where json events can be posted in.

Could make it do any kind of web event, including GET, where we just react in different ways.

The connection could be mapped out in plain text in a diagram, and then the bot wires up the server to route however it is told.

So you should be able to run a whole web page and an API using this system, with all the triggers designed in natural language for you.

Then setting up a webhook on github becomes easy, but this should be the same as setting up an email server too.
