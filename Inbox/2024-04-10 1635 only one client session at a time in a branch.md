If we force that only one key is allowed to pierce into a session, then we can avoid cross contamination of sessions.

When the session starts, the client generates keys that are only valid for that session.
Loss of keys or rotating keys is end of session, and they need to start a new one.
Sessions should be compulsorarily forked from the identity checking chain - the home chain.
