If the purpose of the tasks is to make the system capable of genuine decentralized profit share, so that profit sharing is not at risk of being classed a security, then that is something that has plagued crypto ventures for a long time - how to be decentralized and not a security.

Then the people that stand to profit the most from such a system would be the most likely to invest in it.

Being classed as a security is actually the badge of centralization.  Many people strongly believe in decentralization and want to support it.

We only need enough of a legal opinion to say its possible, and some initial guidance on how hard.  Then we work towards that.

The tasks can be set up by anyone, but some are badged by us.

You can take back your money at any point, but once the task is completed, and the dispute period passed, the money is spent.

During this founders period, you cannot trade any of the NFTs that are generated.  Once the platform is completed, then you can trade them.  Any time any future profit share occurs, these founders shares will receive a portion, since they are the tool used.

Make a legal entity that holds the funds, and has the charter to pursue the given goal, so people have legal recourse during the build period.

We cannot use bank or stripe for this, since would be problematic and more open to securities registration, plus we now have a bank account which can be frozen.

Bank accounts are less transparent than something on chain.  This would be very suspicious to someone like stripe and would cost a lot of admin time.
