If we first reason thru the code in docs, and AI assisted reasoning, types creation, and NL descriptions of what functions do, then we should be able to develop faster, and the AI has enough context to hook everything together ?

Ideally the AI should call the human where it got stuck ?  First fix the docs or make them, then the types, then the code itself.

The key is programming to an interface.

Ideally there would be a model checker like TLA+ running in parallel, and so the model has to pass model validation first.  Later we might at crypto checking to ensure a protocol we are proposing is secure ?
