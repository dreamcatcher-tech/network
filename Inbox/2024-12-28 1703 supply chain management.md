>[!danger] Depends: 

clone the purchaser and invoice person at each company.

hook the emails, so we can sound like them.

roll up the supply chain.

offer the tool and the AI for free, charge for the transactions that we introduce.

offer services to prepay invoices and other things to help cashflow.

make money on the marketplace, as opposed to the software, so the software undercuts everyone else, and then we get a cut of the market transactions.
