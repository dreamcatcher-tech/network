If the hook then triggers us to begin an NL defined workflow that pulls in the new branch, splices it on to main so it can be read from the browser clients, and then goes and runs some processing steps on it to see what parts are suitable to be merged into main.

This then can be our CI pipeline, where changes that are better are automatically merged into master so that next time, the browsers use an improved version of the system.
