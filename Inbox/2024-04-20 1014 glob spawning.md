using io.json to get max spawn speed suffers from having to write a file with 10k actions in it, which is a huge overhead, delaying spin up.

If a dev makes a lot of actions all at once, we can apply batched ramping to get things executing as quickly as possible, as an internal tunable that we keep updated.

However, max speed comes from doing glob pattern matching, which allows us to handle the initial ramp up as well as everything that comes after.
