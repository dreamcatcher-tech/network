So if we could Transcribe directly into the markdown text editor, Then have real time updates go out to anyone else who's also authenticate authenticated to be viewing that editor. Plus there's multiple AIs could respond Good. So, basically, you have several AIs Can be working on the same document They get triggered whenever someone else's remote changes go in. And they pass comment on those changes And, ultimately, we work together with these assistants to produce a document that everyone thinks is of high quality, and they agree to.
