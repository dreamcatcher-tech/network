Artifact should be tested completely in isolation from what the AI results come back, otherwise we are testing ai prompting and ai models, which is supposed to be done on the dreamcatcher.

It should really be able to run any napp,

ARTIFACT IS THE NAPP PLATFORM.

Dreamcatcher is the network of Napps, like what you can do with them.

There are already good package managers for conventional code, and we want to wrap them, not replace them.  We are like a meta package format.
