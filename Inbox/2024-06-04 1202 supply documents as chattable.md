So make a proposal, and then sign the discussions and votations on it using eth wallets.

We could definitely make a document signable using eth, and check the signatures.  Use the plain text arguments to make it plain what is being signed.  Store the sigs in git repos, and then let people run their own versions of the chain to tick it forwards.

When the proposal is given, the chat questions automatically go into the doc for review, so that everyone can modify it, in a liquid fashion.

People can delegate votes and whatever very easily too.
