There is a single init of a repo at the start that is done without any authorization.
Then a single pierce into that repo to do the install that also doesn't have any authentication.

However we could remove the pierce completely if we wrote the initial files with the commit.

If a special version of init is made, then it has the least number of exceptions for the system.

Then the DB would get locked to never allow that function to be called again ?  

The one repo that has no parent.
