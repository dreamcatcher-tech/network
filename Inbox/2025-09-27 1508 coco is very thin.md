Once we are in a coco, we cannot get out of the coco other than shutting down.

We cannot be non confidential.

We can leak confidential data, which is very different, and comes down to audited code.

We should also be able to make the layer that wraps the piece of software we are running to be able to be set to be an iron box and not let anything out.

so the audited layer we need to maintain to keep ourselves safe is very small, and largely provided by the chip manufacturer.
