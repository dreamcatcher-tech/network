if we set up auto gen tool, en masse, guided by skilled workers, then we can see what the workers are doing, so we could tweak the systems to improve.

If we earned enough money to pay for some overhead to tweak the system, then our system can improve, and can grow.

We could allow anyone to work for us, but their credits need to be on the jobs we sponsor, in exchange for our cut.  So they can use tokens for anything they like, but for our jobs, we subsidize the tokens.

If we are quick, we can set up an org that grows like this, with sales people getting in work, workers producing output for customers, and management looking at how to improve the whole thing, add new tech, simplify existingr.

If this whole model was encoded into a blockchain protocol, where that is the business ?
