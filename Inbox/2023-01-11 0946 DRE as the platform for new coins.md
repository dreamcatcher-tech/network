If someone has a new idea for a consensus mechanism or coin, it would be best to build it on our blockchain because:
1. Much of the coding framework is done for them (good DX)
2. There is an available talent pool to do work under easy terms (good BX)
3. An existing client base is available to use it, and pay for it, some of whom can switch automatically

By putting core pieces of infrastructure continually up for auction, any replacement that meets the interface can be automatically switched out of many peoples stack, so there is far less point in trying to get human attention since it is no longer them making the decision and doing the work.

The economic equation should be:
if X is the effort to launch their own coin, and XR is its reward, and
if Y is the effort to launch their own coin on our platform, and YR is its reward, then:

> X / Y << XR / YR

The reward needs to be normalized 

This would allow us to run multiple simultaneous consensus mechisms, and people can select

Try to make a nocode platform for making your own currency or tokens, and it be fully audited.
