if we have a system for recognizing problems, and turning them into things, as well as recording contribution towards them as things too, then we can retrofit historical problems into that system.

so we should seek to get Xanadu into a collection of problems on the system, that is validated by the original authors.  We can build the initial version, and we can try make it look nice, be correct, be reconciled.

These reconciliations are just the exact same as what we would run for our platform anyway.

So, oddly, we would be aiming to induct the Xanadu stucks into Dreamcatcher, and then making sure they are specified correctly, then putting forward the dreamcatcher itself as the solution to many of these problems, whilst building out parts of the dreamcatcher to meet stucks that it doesn't solve yet.

so we parse all their data, pull out the problems, both declared and implied by the types of solutions they are putting forwards, then we pull out all their solutions, as well as the theoretical or gestured ones.
