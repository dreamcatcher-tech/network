Once we have artifact running, we need to set about inducting data.

We could for example digest all the github commits ever, and be able to say something about the usage statistics of commit messages, so could know if your acting weird when you write the messages - should be able to give good informative answers on this.

Using our system, you should be able to start running your own git server, be able to move it between hosting suppliers, run across multiple suppliers including on prem, and run privately on your own.

Self hosting is where our system is capable of running and hosting instances of itself, so nobody has to deal with difficult unrepeatable things like server maintenance
