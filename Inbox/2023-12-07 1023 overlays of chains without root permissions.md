In the case where there is CI complex running, and some users want to submit the output running on their machines, they would make their roots available, and could share between each other using some kind of coordinated chain, so that a veiw including their views could be derived, but it doesn't require the base CI chain to acknowledge them in any way.

So they would create a fork, and then broadcast their forks to each other.

They can be broadcast raw, down different indirect channels like a message board, but also can be accumulated in aggregator chains specially made for this instance of use.
