Make panelling out of plywood with metal skin pulled tight over the top.  Means the amount of metal required is significantly less than if the metal has to hold shape with no tension.
Makes it hard to dent, as could probably be walked on without deforming.
Should look quite nice since looks like a bubble film.

The joins between panels should be a hinge and the hinge is tensioned, meaning the outer lip is under heavy compression.  This ensures watertight seal.  the softer the metal, and if the frame has some give, then the seal is maintained.

A curved dome allows all members to be under hinge stress.
