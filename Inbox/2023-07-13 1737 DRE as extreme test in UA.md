The dreamcatcher was designed as a business model that could thrive in extremely unstable environments.  The earth is an unstable environment, but humans work hard to make it stable, and so in the big established cities, the dreamcatcher is not a clear winner.

However in UA, in a warzone, we expect that conventional business models are failing.  Here we expect to learn more lessons about how the Dreamcatcher needs to be than anywhere else.  We expect the merits of a packet switched innovation network will be strikingly clear in this harsh environment.
