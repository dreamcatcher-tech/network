I would like to implement a system where the **4o** model continually refines the output from the **o1** model, allowing the reasoning process to be rerun each time based on my feedback. The **o1** model essentially handles all the bookkeeping, and it may take several iterations for the user to clarify their needs. Once a well-defined request is established, the final output from **o1** is used or stored.
