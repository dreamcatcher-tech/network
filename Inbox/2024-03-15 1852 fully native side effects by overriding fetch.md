If all possible side effects were turned into actions, then people could write anything they like and we will make it replayable.

So as long as you used our fetch command, you wouldn't need to use anything else special to write side effects that were repeatable.

We couldn't give you streams - stream processing could be done using a useEffect style hook where you give us the function that processes the stream.
