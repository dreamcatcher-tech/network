One of the benefits of having a chat-based coding interface would be that during a day it's very easy to see what the programmer's intent was for the whole time. Now particularly if any browsing that they were doing, or discussions or chats that they were trying to reason about are captured as well, then their intent becomes obvious. Then assistance can be provided by humans or humans assisted by AI to help discover what their true intent was and provide alternative solutions. If the browsing of the net was also done via this way then we can make an Upwork-style interface where you can pay for effort and all the effort is driven through this UI and so you can have more than just a screen grab, it's like you're using the entire environment. So we don't care what their local workstation was configured with, we don't need any of that, it's just simply fire up the system and act as a jockey on it. Putting in effort can be appraised in terms of the intelligence you put in, and so it's more not about the time in attendance, although that does help. It measures the tokens you've burned which can be given to you as part of what the workplace supplies you. But it shows the intellect that you're putting into the system and avoids any such things like mouse wiggling or other types of circumventions. It also provides a lasting record of your work and intelligence that can be appraised for novelty and plagiarism or the use of another AI can simply be detected, but all we care about is the outcome that resulted in the end.

Also when debugging usage, having the git commits available is far better than having the logs, since the full system state can be recreated and experimented with.
