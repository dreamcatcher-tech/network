you could also run a superior tor network, by having fully autonomous cocos that purposefully switch themselves around hosts, so they're always jumping, then they purposefully do mixing of traffic and payloads and things, then move to a new host so the network traffic can't be sniffed too much.

so these cocos are what you'd use to connect to, send some instructions to some other coco with instructions like 'delay by 2 months' or 'if you haven't heard from me in a year, push the button' or whatever.

so all the outside world saw was your browser connect to a coco host, and then if that host is compromised, see you connect to a coco that was running the mixer, and then that's the end of it - you'd never know what the fluff happened after that.

so all web browsing should be done out of these gateways, which pool traffic so it isn't clear who you are.  the citadel.

could enable high bandwidth tor, but also bake in payments to keep the network healthy.
