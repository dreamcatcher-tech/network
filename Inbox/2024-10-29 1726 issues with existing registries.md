You can't download the whole thing
You can't contribute bandwidth to run it
You can't run things directly on the registry.
You can't search across all registries
Each one is specific to exactly one code type
I don't get paid for putting code on them
They don't have a clear revenue model
publishing to them feels very remote
I can't see who is downloading my code and how they are using it
They don't help me monetize my code
When I do pay to these registries, its hard to see where my money is going - will it go to help the things I want ?
I can't pay for code to be changed.
packages depend on urls, not hashes, so I can't use any distributed storage, nor can I pin against a hash until AFTER the package is downloaded - ie: no signed pacakges
There is always a break from the git commit that made the package, so I cannot attest to the provenance
The pacakges are not deduplicated in their components


Probably if you had 20 of it, you could run 99% of all popular software.
