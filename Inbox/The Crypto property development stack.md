The Crypto property development stack.

The concept of Satoshi Island is to enable seamless use of crypto assets in the property development sector, using blockchain smart contracts to reduce administrative friction and allow participants smoother, lower cost opportunities whilst allowing a pooling of resources to gain access to ventures otherwise out of reach, such as purchasing an Island.  In a nutshell, using crypto assets to acquire and create property assets, then convert them into crypto assets.  This process should be repeatable many times, increasing value each time, rewarding and incentivizing participants.

Visualized as independent layers, the crypto property development stack looks like:

```
Innovation Economy (high speculation)
-----------
Inhabitant Economy (low speculation)
-----------
Builder Economy (medium speculation)
-----------
Land Deeds (high speculation)
-----------
Government (local property speculation)
```

The speculation level refers to assert price fluctuations at that layer due to opinions, which is roughly proportional to the risks involved.  The inhabitant economy approaches a stablecoin type of operation, the land deeds approach an altcoin cryptocurrency type, but the builder economy is somewhere in between, and represents the crucial phase change from wild speculation to stable inhabitancy.  In many ways it is the dreamkiller, ending the speculative phase, which is perhaps one contributing reason why Satoshi Island has stalled at this transition.

If we look at Satoshi Island in Vanuatu as really just the land plus building permit integration with the local government, then we can consider the endeavor of building homes and infrastructure as a different layer in the stack.  There are already several proposed plans to achieve this, there is conflict as to how much margin should be added to support the island, and there are issues with funding of the building, especially with the risk associated with property development in a remote location.

If there were several land based entities around the world that were committed to making NFT based land plots that could be traded and moved around with similar rules, then we can use the same builder model everywhere, regardless of the different depth of connection to the local government underneath the land layer.

The builder model should allow for many competing and locally specialized options to be available in a marketplace, but all under the same base rules, where the builder model operating company enforces rules and settles disputes.  The builder model requires compatibility with the land layer to ensure all interactions and contractual arrangements promised on chain can be enforced in the real world, but beyond that interface it should be otherwise independent.  The builder layer would provide metaverse visualization and planning tools, along with project management services and tooling.  The resulting crypto assets would be freely tradeable and fractionalized, as far as local law allows.

DeFi finance solutions would also emerge at the builder layer, ranging from mortgage pools to insurance providing, to speculative ventures that build homes and then sell them once completed for margin.  The knowledge and experience would grow with each realized physical asset and so too would the trust in the system.

So then, if the builder model is promoted as the next phase of the project, and it is launched with relative independence from Satoshi Island, then a lab can be any other project that connects land to crypto assets in a way that is compatible with building on.  The success of the builder model in a more industrialized environment like Phuket would mean faster feedback and iteration of the model, but can embolden using the model on Satoshi Island.  Critically, independence between building and land can be demonstrated.  This allows a new project to form, rather than people expecting the same worn out project on Satoshi to somehow magically also conjure up some building activity when the environment has shifted heavily against its success, with increased shipping costs being just one factor.

Its separation also makes it easier to integrate an OpenAI partnership at this level.

Operating independently means a fresh set of rules for operation, and a decoupling from Vanuatu. Making this layer would drag Satoshi Island into compliance as it is currently a little bit aimless while it grapples with how to become a builder when it is really just land.  Providing this layer virtually and globally means that crypto inhabitants can be fluid worldwide, and can be assured of compatibility and standardization anywhere they might go, in whatever language, where they trust the builder layer to have terraformed the underlying land layer into a form they understand and can interact with.
