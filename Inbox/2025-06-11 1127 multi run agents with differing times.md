If each request kicked off with 5 different models and approaches, and then we present back the best result whilst the others run, so that you can move on or wait for better responses.

these should also do things like deciding what you wanted to do, so it thinks a lot about it.

then appraise which is the best result.

the multiverse strategy - so no matter what any system does, we always have the best possible results, and we learn from each one by comparing them all and selecting the best ones, then when the humans corrects us, we store a knowledge base article as to why.
