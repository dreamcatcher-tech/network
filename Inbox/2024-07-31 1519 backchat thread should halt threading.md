we would add the tool call result to the thread, but not engage the thread any more.
This only occurs in the backchat thread.

ONLY if the focus is the same after this tool call returns would we rerun the thread.

So if a new thread is made, the current thread would stay static.

ANY creating a thread should have some initial prompt dropped in there.
