If we set up an api like openrouter that would:
1. screen all the data for confidential data
2. ensure that the endpoints of the api calls were currently in compliance with the stated rules of the org
3. stay up to date with api calls of providers
4. apply translation techniques to anonymize data on the fly

Might be able to do this on emails too ?

openrouter is like a specialized form of what we want for the general api gateway.

the gateway api would be run using the same mechanisms as it uses to manage api calls, that is to say that it is run by various providers.
