If we set up an api like openrouter that would:
1. screen all the data for confidential data
2. ensure that the endpoints of the api calls were currently in compliance with the stated rules of the org
3. stay up to date with api calls of providers
4. apply translation techniques to anonymize data on the fly

Might be able to do this on emails too ?

openrouter is like a specialized form of what we want for the general api gateway.

the gateway api would be run using the same mechanisms as it uses to manage api calls, that is to say that it is run by various providers.

We could have apps where all the data is declassified and replaced with tokens.  Then all AI queries are done on this protected data, which means we can stop worrying about what services it is running on, as the web becomes increasingly tangled, then when the tokens are seen, as a presentation layer, we lift these off.

So the data comes back as inert, and then we reassemble the sensitive info on it, for presentation purposes, and we limit how much of that data can be accessed, and what the patterns are over time.
