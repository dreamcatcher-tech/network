Instead of going thru the actors primary chain, we just run a clone of the remote repo, and make it be a consensus follower, so it always stays up to date as much as it is allowed.

We could then allow for multiple consensus leaders to add new branches and commits, and have those be accepted by others, so we are all using the exact same repo, in essence, rather than our copy.

We can also let people commit as a witness, and then the quorum may allow it.
