gives highly detailed metadata, which can avoid us having to store it ?

open router lets us see inside the requests much more than we do at the moment.

if we just store their request id as metadata, we can look up all the rest, which saves us having to surface that internally.

they actually give us money charged back, which openai doesn't.

we can use their api to provision keys, one per user.

then we can also let people oauth around to gain access to openrouter.  We still get the usage data.
