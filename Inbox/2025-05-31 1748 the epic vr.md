be able to generatively make scenes in unity that are breathtakingly realistic and render them in the headset.

we all can take various tools with us, as they are plugins.  Our own browser layouts around the room, an angled drawing board to two that can serve as podium style touch screens and stylus surfaces.

The scenes can be gracious and can also render information about the world around us for us, like possibly security camera footage being modified to provide subtle hints, like if a certain bird flies over it means someone unknown is coming down the path.

have a board and then have open windows as part of a massive wheel that you can move.

we should be able to show off new VR interfaces easily, and ask for changes, as the creation process becomes more automated, and our contributors increase.  We all pay a small amount to benefit from constant little improvements.
