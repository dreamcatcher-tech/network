>[!danger] Depends: 

take childrens classics, generate modified versions using characters the child knows, and generate images on the fly as the story is being read.

so use these stories as the base, to hold everything together, then modify on top.

let the child insert their own paths in there.
debate with them about what the character should do.
generate some images of the character to use as base images.
