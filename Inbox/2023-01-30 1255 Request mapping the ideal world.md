Requests and Ideas used properly should be able to make a detailed description of what in the world needs to change for an ideal scenario.  If enough people agree that this is ideal, it will eventually happen - humans love to contribute to their ideal.  If we can help define that and define the overlap, then we can achieve faster.

With ideal defined, we can redirect as we learn more about why it cannot be how we thought.
