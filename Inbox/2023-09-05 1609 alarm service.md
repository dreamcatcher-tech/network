Use any camera, upload footage using decentralized storage systems.

Process the feed and trigger alarms when suspicious activity occurs.  A human is notified.  Whenever they respond, this is used to train the algos further, to reduce the human interactions.

Then an uber like service with a security alert flag goes out, where a callout is performed and checking the video feed.  This costs the user money, can be set to auto, up to some price limit.  Can purchase insurance plans that pay a monthly to spread the callout costs around.

Stop the feed when you're home, and know with certainty that nothing is being uploaded.

Providing the secure substrate for applications to run, and completely disabling them is valuable.
