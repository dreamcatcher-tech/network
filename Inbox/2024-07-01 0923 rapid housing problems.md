Issue is that with a closed source design, and a closed mfg network,
The key is really the open network design, so that orders can be fulfilled anywhere, and by anyone, with varying price and quality.

So an open system is best, since parts can be produced and enhanced, with feedback built in to usage.
Items should have sensors to determine correct safe assembly and feed back on usage.
Also environmental sampling so we know performance.
Periodically detect leakage.

If you knew where all the money went, you wouldn't mind paying as much.  Profit margins being as much as they can be stops people purchasing since they fear for being ripped off, and so they select another option that is just cheaper or more transparent or they do it themselves.
Suspicion kills a lot of good intentioned projects.

Poorly selected margins can cause some people in the chain to not purchase, which stops people even further down receiving the innovation.  So the margin being fair, transparent, and centrally decided by automation means the chains can stretch longer.

Rewarding people for improving a design is important too, since it pulls them together instead of forking off.

Would always have computer models determining the safety aspects of any localized customizations.

Can sell insurance and safety certifications locally for a good price.

Almost like we can't have a fair supply chain unless it is fully automated and fully transparent.  And that such a supply chain can never be beaten, since any other chain contains unfairness somewhere.  Just the accounting considerations alone are too much to do manually.  Then for it to adapt, it requires too much labour.

Getting parts should be easy, and building up as much as you need or can afford should be done by a computer modelling system.  That modelling system should refer you to another system if it thinks your constraints are better met there.
