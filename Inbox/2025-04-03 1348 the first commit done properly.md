If a blank repo is initialized, we need to figure out what the branch will be, and then set that its first commit will be coming from artifact ?

Or we could say that you cannot clone an empty repo, there must be at least one commit ?

Or we could keep the lineage completely separate ?

Maybe independent lineage is actually preferred ?

It might actually be advantageous to have independent histories because it prohibits any merging to occur.
