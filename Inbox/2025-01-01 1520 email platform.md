allow 'send as' so that we can impersonate an address without requiring full ownership of that address.  This can be done in aws.

Having email receiving ability is massive, since people can email in files, which is a common way for them to access the files.

Also sending emails out is super useful too, since it can draft things.

Importing the whole mailbox seems like a useful thing but a bit of a chore.



Receive in the email into an s3 bucket using aws, and then ingest that into git asynchronously.

Pull apart into our own format for further processing.
Begin auto processing to generate responses.

Make a cheap version that includes a watermark advertising our services.  Get affiliate sales if people sign up and pay.  So we can allow you to, when looking to find a new supplier, shortlist a bunch based on web search, then email them all and engage in conversations to figure out what you want.  Each email advertises how our bots can be used for the recipients to process their email too.
