allow 'send as' so that we can impersonate an address without requiring full ownership of that address.  This can be done in aws.

Having email receiving ability is massive, since people can email in files, which is a common way for them to access the files.

Also sending emails out is super useful too, since it can draft things.

Importing the whole mailbox seems like a useful thing but a bit of a chore.

These could be part of our subscriptions that offer context grabbing ability at near cost, so that you can burn tokens on it, again at near cost, so that we can benefit from the capability, and the broader deals, and the marketplace of services where people agree to do things for other people, or trade assets, or commission work, and we get a cut of this - a cut of the growth energy expenditure, not just the done work.

The done work is useful but a bit stale, and it slows down new work if you're charging for old work.  Growth is about new.
