Multi topics can show several forks, with the topics being parked until we can get to them.

By using git, we can allow the model to speculatively make a bunch of changes in the background, so you can see what they look like before you merge them in, but so that when you do agree to merge, it is near instant, since work has been done speculatively.  Branching production is key to this ability.
