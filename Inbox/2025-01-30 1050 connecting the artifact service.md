If you run this on your local machines, then they can coordinate with cloud hosts, and with each other.

So they set up webrtc connections or other methods with their local clients, where they figure out how to connect, so if they lose one network interface (like the internet pipe) then they can still operate locally.

They can optionally provide a browser interface that they will accept logins from one via an approved method.

A browser can start up and can connect to these local instances using webrtc and maintain that connection if the net goes down.  Or it can use an ugly local network address.

Or you can run a local app that will give you a web interface to your network.

Then the compute capacities the servers have to offer can be seen.
