This would reset back to the moneyworks branch by replacing the directories.

The history of any file affected by this would show as simply system reset.

Walking the tree is probably fast if its in a pack file.  Packfiles would make that walk nearly instant.  

Downloading the whole repo history is probably easier than downloading it a piece at a time, latency is less, transaction costs are much less too.
