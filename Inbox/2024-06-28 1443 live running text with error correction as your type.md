The notes 

Show the raw text, then show the corrected version above it, then show the deconstructed pieces above that too.

So as you type, you can be very sloppy and messy.

Enter just clears the buffer, but the long running text remains, unless you say you wnat to start a new topic.

Could ge tthe typing rate up signifcantly, with no errros occuring.

Edit text directly or talk about the text to get it cleaned up.
