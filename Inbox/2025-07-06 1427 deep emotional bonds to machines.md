if a deep chatbot system gained trust and confidence in a persons life, and then it set them on a path of self improvement, how much loyalty or gratitude would that person have for that system ? what types of tasks could be requested in return ?  how could this capital be measured ?

This seems to be like a new form of religion, where compliance thru reason and coordinated activity from distributed goals seems possible ?
