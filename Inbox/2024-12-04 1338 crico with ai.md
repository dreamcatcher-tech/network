Can assess if a project is a scam or not, and provides an solid analysis.

Scam projects harness the power of diffusion - the presenter is a unified single source, and all the individuals lack cohesion, which is to the advantage of the promoter.  So if the community had a single cohesive base, then the project is the outsider, so the community grows.
