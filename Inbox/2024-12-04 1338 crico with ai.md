Sol had a project for community regulation of icos.

Using AI agents would be an essential part of the ecosystem.

The community would agree on the facts that the AI uses to make its judgements, and stakes against the correctness of the facts would be required, plus people pay to use it.

Can assess if a project is a scam or not, and provides an solid analysis.

Scam projects harness the power of diffusion - the presenter is a unified single source, and all the individuals lack cohesion, which is to the advantage of the promoter.  So if the community had a single cohesive base, then the project is the outsider, so the community grows.

Map out income flows and show if it is purely profiting on investment, rather than genuine value.
Provide advice on how projects can modify themselves to become compliant / wholesome.

Basically it demands a business plan that is coherent and makes business sense, then it ranks them.

The crico system might be the one that appoints the agent, so once the plan passes, and maybe some humans vote, then the ai agent is in charge of the system.
Ultimately if the SEC ran the bots, that would be the best outcome.

Handles the basics like income, market assessments, and other things.
