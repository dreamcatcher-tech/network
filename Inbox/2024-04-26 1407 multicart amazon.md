A modern marketplace should let me schedule and consume services, and channel and parse communications involved in that transaction, and receive recommendations for products within it.

Personal trainers should be actually training a bot with each interaction, and people consume that intelligence along with an order.

Launching into a gym chain is the best way to start this system anyway.
