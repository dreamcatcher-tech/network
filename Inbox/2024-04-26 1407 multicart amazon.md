A modern marketplace should let me schedule and consume services, and channel and parse communications involved in that transaction, and receive recommendations for products within it.

Personal trainers should be actually training a bot with each interaction, and people consume that intelligence along with an order.

Launching into a gym chain is the best way to start this system anyway.

Tool would let users chat to the system to book appointments with suitable trainers, and navigate everyones schedule.  Let it see your schedule and try figure something out for you, given all the options, including opportune times.  Let you do on call, when cancellations or dead spots occur.

Have teams of people working together with trainers.  Help intro people with common interests to each other using AI.  Handle payment for gym membership and trainers under one credit card.  

Product recommendations from users as well as trainers, where users earn for reviews and for pushing products onto others.

Profiles where anyone can see what anyone else has been consuming.

Bridge into amazon using an automated scraping tool.
Let users manage collections of their recommendations.
Buy things in a wish list, at a wished price, and once the commitment is big enough, broker deals with suppliers to get the discount.

AI recommendation of products based on users and trainers teaching the AI when and why something is good.  Uses the ranking system of users and trainers to discern what is valuable data.
