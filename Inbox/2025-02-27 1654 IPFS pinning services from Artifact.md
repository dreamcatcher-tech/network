What we can allow is that if we had a small number of reliable IPFS nodes that were always on, then if people want to take artifact data or blobs and say that they are to be made available on the IPFS network, this should be a very simple call to make these IPFS servers anyone could host one where you just pull down the pin list from artifact and you start hosting it yourself. You may be able to earn revenue for this service, but it means that you can integrate artifact objects with things that are compatible with the IPFS Network with ease. 

Opensea can take a url, so we might just use a raw artifact address, which includes the hash, and set it public.  Commit + path.

Permissions would be set in the filesystem ?
