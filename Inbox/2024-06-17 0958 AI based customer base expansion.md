Use traditional channels, talking to humans, wehre the AI handles the expansion of a service channel.

Start talking to a particular service that our human is consuming about how to expand the payment service options they offer, such as a NZ bank account controlled by an AI.

The AI would have access to open banking.  

So it asks the user if they'd like to push the process along, and then it manages drafting emails and things pressuring the retailer to open up their services, which results in savings for both retailer and customer, since direct bank transfers are free and can be very quick.
