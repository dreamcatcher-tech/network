intelli-you

like the broadcasting models of old, consultancy is heading towards key influencers, and we need a standard platform to do that.

means we can send very presetable people in to meetings, like strippers, but the ai contains all the intelligence, so we don't need the top person in there all the time.

The platform acts as a time multiplier for the top consultants, since they can solve the hard problems only, and can resell things they have said already.

If we gained entry to small businesses by providing legal services, with assurances, and a tool that is very cheap to use, since we provide it at cost.

cost if we can see your queries, or free if you bring your own key.  If you want to keep it private from us, then it will cost extra.

Saturate the market with free AI tooling that scores the best, and make sure it is very well calibrated to find the edges, and when legal advice is required, it supplies that.  That is what people pay for.

If you find some features you want it to do, you can pay for that too.  Better code, better bots, whatever you want.

May allow people to set their own price for bots they have programmed.  We can determine if the value is warranted separately ? or we can be the ones that set the price for the knowledge ?  Or, it must be free, and people pay for you to assure them it has generated correctly.

In the probabilistic computing world, how can you have certainty ?
This is what people must pay for.

Make it so good that people tell other people, and have it be social so that they can team up and help each other out with it.
