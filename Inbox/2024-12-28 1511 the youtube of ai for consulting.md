like the broadcasting models of old, consultancy is heading towards key influencers, and we need a standard platform to do that.

means we can send very presetable people in to meetings, like strippers, but the ai contains all the intelligence, so we don't need the top person in there all the time.

The platform acts as a time multiplier for the top consultants, since they can solve the hard problems only, and can resell things they have said already.

If we gained entry to small businesses by providing legal services, with assurances, and a tool that is very cheap to use, since we provide it at cost.

cost if we can see your queries, or free if you bring your own key.  If you want to keep it private from us, then it will cost extra.
