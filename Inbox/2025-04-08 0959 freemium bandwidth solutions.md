Using a decentralized set of computers, we should be able to do the freemium model.

If people give away free bandwidth, then when payment comes in for other parts of the system, those fremium suppliers should get cut in.

So you could post your own videos, having your own server that runs most of the time, but you host some other peoples videos for free in exchange for them hosting yours.
