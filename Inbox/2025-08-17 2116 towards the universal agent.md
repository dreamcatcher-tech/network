This is one that can do anything, with any tool.

Given that we have all the components in place, then allowing some highly focused tool calling and using this agent as just the intent signaller, then we should be able to make it, and have it be highly functional.

tool search should be offloaded to a range of agents that thoroughly test what the tooling does.
