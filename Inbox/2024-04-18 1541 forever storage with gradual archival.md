If the contract is forever, but the longer between reads, the longer it will take to come online, since the storage gets colder.  If we fail to produce within this time, slashing occurs.
Reads cost money, so we do get topped up for storing for a long time.

Show graphs of price of storage over time, and indicate when paying this amount now means forever.

We can set the contract to make it so that access pays for the long term storage shortfalls.
Also long term archived data can earn interest, or stake rewards, where access fees go and pay these storages, compounding, making them more valuable to store.

So whilst the bulk overall costs are up front determined, any variations can be applied over time.

If you upload something useful, then you should get paid a small amount if people pay to access it.  This incentivizes sharing, and deduplication.

This might get used for torrents, but that seems not our business.

Also derived deduplication, like streams of different quality video - its easy to recreate, so might be cheaper to recompute than to store.

We would said a fair agent in charge, and lay out these basic ground rules.
