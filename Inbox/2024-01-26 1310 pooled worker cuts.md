If AI is used to coordinate workers to provide a better service to buyers, and help with discovery and price reckoning, then we could offer the software for free, but charge cuts on pooled services like insurance, legal representation, payment processing fees.

This means the workers can pay in to a holiday pay scheme, and a debt recovery scheme, and we take a cut of these fees.

Ideally we would take a cut of everything, but we need some threshold to let people enter without any fees.  So we might just charge for AI to start with.
