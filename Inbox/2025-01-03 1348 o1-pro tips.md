And so the issue seems to be when generating with O1 Pro that if it has ancillary files within the prompt and the files are wrong it will be unable to ignore them so it can't seem to ignore things when it's told and so this means that we might need to make a dedicated step where it selects what to ignore and then it blinks them out of its mind before answering the question because it seems to be unable to handle this internally.

Also, being able to make top-level guidance documents, blocking out everything else, and then maybe using reference documents like prompts and rules to guide that, can help roll down the stack. So basically, we're just top-level thinking, apply the reasoning, and then low-level thinking, where we're following out the commands, as opposed to trying to do everything all at once, or do multiple features at once.

Also can't ignore content well, so things like issues, need to narrow those down to just little pieces.  Uncertainty kills it, so can't be vague about things.
