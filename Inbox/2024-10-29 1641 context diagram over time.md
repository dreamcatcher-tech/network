The first derivative of a workflow is the context diagram.
The second derivative is how the context diagram changes over time.

This is the roadmap.

We can describe it as the context diagram at certain points in time, with multiple paths taken.

We should be able to model these and the assumptions, and weight the value of each path, then be able to switch between them rapidly if they make more sense.

So the milestones would be how new external relationships have been exposed, or existing relationships altered in a meaningful way.

Then show how much effort, time, and cost is needed to go one path or the other.
