1. repos
2. napps
3. runtimes
4. the standard environment

show different kinds of runtime conditions:
1. pure
2. pure with consensus

4. side effect with consensus

This makes it like an operating system, but for everything.  Like the last operating system.

layers:
1. cpu architecture
2. hypervisor
3. container
4. napp
