Each message should be a standalone file where the md file has the header info from the server.

Then a folder represents an email chain, where replies are made.  The names are in chronological order.  The message has everything we received from the server, including the https cert from the api call we made to get it.

The simpel test for completeness is that for a given email, we should be able to prove beyond all doubt that the large trusted mailserver interacted with us at what time, and that a public blockchain timestamped it.  This should all be near instant and extremely cheap.

Until we can meet this goal, we can keep posting stucks and funding their completion.

OR one massive dir with all the messages, and thread files that are used to reference links to the messages that make up the threads.

The link lists can be used to show weaker links and forwarding where any email was copied and sent thru.
