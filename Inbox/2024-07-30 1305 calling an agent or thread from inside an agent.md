This should probably be a call to switchboard.

If we want to pass control in our thread, that seems different to starting a new independent thread, and then talking to it.

When should the call end ?

Could they end implicitly, if the calling thread doesn't ask any more questions of them ?

Or keep it running until we explicitly end it ?

Thread would be a peer.
