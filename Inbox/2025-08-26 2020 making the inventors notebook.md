knows that when entering, the ideas may be jumbled.

knows you might have a mix of typing and voice.

knows to preseve the raw data input foremost, and then generate what it thinks are the repercussions.

adds helpful hints, keeps things organized.

Basically provides an infinite entry canvas, and then pulls bits off and makes them nice.

an agent is doing this, and is triggering other agents to work on it in the background.
