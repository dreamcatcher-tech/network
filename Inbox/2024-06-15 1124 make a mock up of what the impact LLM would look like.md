If we could share a bot that could be used to generate impact crystal visualizations and manipulations, this can prove the feasibility of what we're doing - looking for greater accuracy and more authoritative impact calculations that are more stable under adversarial claims.

Putting this thing in charge of human commercial endeavours requires quite a bit of safety.

Then we can put it in charge of work on Satoshi Island, so we can demonstrate and study its effects on community.

Needs to separate impacted and impactee - as in who is impacted and who contributed.

Need to start an open source work effort, so we can openly talk about what is going on.

Show how the chat would work to get different views of the data.

This should be a collab effort between multiple labs, like meta and google too.
