They should have immense scale and speed, run in the cloud with zero maintenance, but when disconnected the clients should be able to still carry on doing at least something on their own, between themselves.

The data should be in a plain text format, and readily exportable to any known tools.

Maintaining servers is stupid and expensive, but everyone has to maintain their clients.  So if we use the clients as the backups, then running on the cloud is less risky, since no locked in data as it is always backed up on every client.
