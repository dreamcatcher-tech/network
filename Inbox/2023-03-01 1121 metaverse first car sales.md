Browse and assemble your car in metaverse, including modelling it.
Use tools that rapidly redesign your car based on changing supply chains and available components, as well as pricing.

Best eco friendly car is one that can be upgraded as better systems become available, rather than a final sealed unit.

No need for a physical showroom, as the VR showroom lets people have their custom cars ahead of time, test drive them, park them, and even sculpt cars for each other, making a p2p marketplace for designs.

Manufacturing cells can then plug into this demand and supply these cars.

Compentized cars are easier to repair from damage, recycle, upgrade, and take advantage of innovations like battery enhancements, computer vision enhancements, regulation changes.

Custom cars by default means people can attach emotionally to the product more, and it can easily be refreshed and revived.  Apps are far more forthcoming as they can first be tested in VR, then published live.

Modular cells that plug into a bus allow things like compute / server modules, gasoline generators, etc.  Can be used to power back to a house, make the inverter be reversable.  The modules can also be used without the car being present.

## Componentized Manufacturing
Designs pieces to strict interfaces, and models most things in software.  Then as AI assistants enter, interface testing and auto tuning to intent becomes less costly for humans.
