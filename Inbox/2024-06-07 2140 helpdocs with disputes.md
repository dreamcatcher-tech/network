Create these items that can get voted on by a dao.

Have a chat with the project as a whole and be shown as the text in generated of divisions in the project between who thinks what. 

Then when different members put a bot foward, the differences can be automatically figured out between their positions.

The bot represents peoples positions on things.

Show a diff view when generating text between different conflicting sources.

Tie them up in a hierarchy so that questions can go up and down levels.

We need a way to make these agents and share them around and ingest the information they represent.

Could make NFTs of these bots, where they are dynamic.  The NFT is used to certify the contents of the bot, so when you talk with it, you know you're talking to the attested thing.

Also impact crystals for each docbot is generated.

Need summarizers of the sessions of these bots, and the surfacing of new questions.

Make a negotiation tool that lets people agree on little pieces and priorities together before voting.

Be able to put in messages from other people
