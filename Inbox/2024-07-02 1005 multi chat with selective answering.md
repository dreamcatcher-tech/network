When multiple people are in the session, we would run a checker bot that would determine if a bot response is appropriate or not.  The users might be just talking to themselves.
In parallel, start the generation, but only display it when the checker says its ok.
We would run multiple temp versions of the response and then choose which one is best.
Could show the 3 responses as they are forming, and show the current favourite forming in the ranker.

If some background process occurs, or some info changed externally, then the bot might initiate saying something.

Bot may edit if the users comments landed in while it was already generating a prior response.
