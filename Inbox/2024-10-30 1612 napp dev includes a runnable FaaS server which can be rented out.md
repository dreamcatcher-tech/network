If you want to run in local dev, we provide a FaaS implementation to run everything locally.

While using this service, you can optionally offer it for sale to others to use.  You can also rent others.  Build up credit which can be used to run your code on others machines.

Set up the social network of machines you trust, and use things trusted by those you trust.  View the network graph and interact with it.

Optionally download different grades of the registry, like the 80% stuff, or wider ranging packages, or specific package paths.

Sell a single server module that has everything assembled, that can be used as a sealed solar computer attached to a single solar panel.

Purchase these credits using credit card.

The price might be controlled by algorithm to give gains over time.
