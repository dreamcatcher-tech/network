bugs
- default assistant should use grok
- a range of basic assistants should be preloaded
- the dreamcatcher assistant is a valet into the platform, which can help you make assistants or can hand over to other assistants
- preview errors in artifacts should show the errors, and it should feed back in to the model, to edit the assistant response in place
