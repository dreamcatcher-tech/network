The performance reports should be updated automatically each day, and feedback in chat given between the staff and the reports.

So a yearly salary review is really a daily salary review.  Changing what is measured can be changed with a discussion.

If the company motto is "attribute to all who contribute" then bonus payments can be calculated directly from this performance model.  "to benefit all who contribute" leaves out the difficult part of figuring out how much.  It implies fairness, but leaves it open to interpretation.

So if we are putting forwards a means of calculating what benefit is in numerical terms, then we should get a cut of that too.

So if we can tie the project metrics to the performance payouts, there should be strong alignment between the goals of the individual and the goals of the project and the goals of the org.

We should be able to weld together the site data, and provide an intelligent AI based system with each site, so the handover is intelligent, and remains accessible and queryable.

Public works can let the public take in the information in an intelligent chattable way.
