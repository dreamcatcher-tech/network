Can the metrics be put into a chain periodically ?
When each bucket closes, a git commit is triggered.
First write to a new bucket triggers a delayed queue action to close out the bucket when its done.

Could be a separate branch on the main account, used for stats tracking.  Lets us purge it periodically.  Summarize the stats periodically.
