Can the metrics be put into a chain periodically ?
When each bucket closes, a git commit is triggered.
First write to a new bucket triggers a delayed queue action to close out the bucket when its done.

Could be a separate branch on the main account, used for stats tracking.  Lets us purge it periodically.  Summarize the stats periodically.

Because each queue message results in a commit being done, we could store the metrics in the commit itself, like the atomic retry number, the time to process, the delay time since the message was enqueued ?

If the commits held the metrics, then reading the metrics is probably a bit of a heavy load.
Some accounting should be added there, so people can audit where the costs went, but timing is eaiser in a centralized db ?
Stamp the queue depth into the commit too.
If the summary db is used to handle high volume viewing, and the commits are used for detailed analysis of a specific commit, we should be able to trace down anything.

Use sound to indicate metrics - errors as a click / crackle, normal activity like a gentle hum.
pool and execute as a different tone
branch and merge as opposing tones
