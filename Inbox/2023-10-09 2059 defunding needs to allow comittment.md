So can prove that you won't defund before a certain time.

This could be defundStart with the removal of the stop ability ?
So if you specified some amount in start, then you can't cancel it ?
Or you could start with a bool that says strong commitment, and this won't allow stopping
`bool unstoppable` means you are strongly committed.
