As soon as a connection is made from a client, we can move a coco and load it in one of the edge locations, so they're always running as close as possible to the edge.

The requests are often long lived so we don't mind a little extra start time perhaps ?

The coco can start running with not all its image, as this can still be streaming down, with priority given to the bits it wants to access first.

Also the git side of things is streaming in too, so the response time can be quite fast.
