Agents with admin control on each computer.  HAL can file stack overflow bugs.
Take a photo to show the physical state for it to be interpreted.

Each time you post a problem, and optionally put some funding against it, a human comes and tries to teach HAL how to solve the problem.  HAL ensures that the complete stranger doesn't do anything bad to the computer.

In this way, the staff are global, and are continually teaching HAL so they never have to save the same problem twice.

Any time anyone gets stuck the same way twice, its inefficient.  The measure of your innovation rate is how many times people are getting stuck in the same place.
