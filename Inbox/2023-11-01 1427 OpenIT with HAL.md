Agents with admin control on each computer.  HAL can file stack overflow bugs.
Take a photo to show the physical state for it to be interpreted.

Each time you post a problem, and optionally put some funding against it, a human comes and tries to teach HAL how to solve the problem.  HAL ensures that the complete stranger doesn't do anything bad to the computer.

In this way, the staff are global, and are continually teaching HAL so they never have to save the same problem twice.

Any time anyone gets stuck the same way twice, its inefficient.  The measure of your innovation rate is how many times people are getting stuck in the same place.

Funding for the stuck gets you royalty if it gets reused.

Make the site documentation chattable, so that any questions can be asked of it.
When new kinds of questions get asked, we can create a stuck, and either improve HAL or expand the docs, so we can always give the owners of the system the data in the way they want it.

Changes can be presented as a bot, and the total impact can be assessed by HAL.  User questions can get stored for future reference as permanent questions that get asked of every proposal.
