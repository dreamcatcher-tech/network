Agents with admin control on each computer.  HAL can file stack overflow bugs.
Take a photo to show the physical state for it to be interpreted.

Each time you post a problem, and optionally put some funding against it, a human comes and tries to teach HAL how to solve the problem.  HAL ensures that the complete stranger doesn't do anything bad to the computer.

In this way, the staff are global, and are continually teaching HAL so they never have to save the same problem twice.

Any time anyone gets stuck the same way twice, its inefficient.  The measure of your innovation rate is how many times people are getting stuck in the same place.

Funding for the stuck gets you royalty if it gets reused.

Make the site documentation chattable, so that any questions can be asked of it.
When new kinds of questions get asked, we can create a stuck, and either improve HAL or expand the docs, so we can always give the owners of the system the data in the way they want it.

Changes can be presented as a bot, and the total impact can be assessed by HAL.  User questions can get stored for future reference as permanent questions that get asked of every proposal.

Handle generation of quotes and proposals.
Allow AI to interogate the soundness of proposals, reconcile against existing infrastructure, then check against best practice, ensure all questions are answered about it.  Bot can then answer questions based on the pool of facts.  Compare against market rates to indicate the fairness of the quote.

The problem is that there is no internal driver inside an IT company to favour reduced effort.  So like a 3rd party needs to exist that makes money by being the cost driver down.  A company that works hard to ensure that it is no longer required - how can those incentives be set up ?  Capitalism doesn't allow such incentives to exist.  But an AI system could be given these goals and could continually, altruistically do these assessments.  So dreamcatcher would vend a system that could be trusted to goal down the costs.  We pay out to people that cut costs.  If the AI was looking at the full picture, and was goaled towards that, then it can earn impact for people which is reputation, which shows as good reputation for being earnest, driving costs down, and charging a fair price for doing it.  Viewing the whole keeps it focused on overall impact.  So an AI that viewed the whole interactions, and rated impact of different behaviours, could help to optimize these kinds of local good wholistic bad behaviours.  Like a managed world view.  A government, of sorts.

If we had the platform that provided generative feedback on planned IT changes, then we can also run a marketplace that can offer component services, and hardware services, as was as scoped locally, to enable the plans to be carried out.  We are an IT planning company and market maker, we don't provide it service directly.  By having this market, we ensure competition of ideas and pricing.  The marketplace keeps everyone honest.  We are the markert rule setter, and we offer a highly intelligent marketplace, and make our money from thruput in the market.  We compete to be the most efficient and fairest, and so that drives prices down for our customers.  Internally on our platform, participants compete with each other, ensuring strong internal health.

Example of intelligence is contemplating a backup solution, and then it sends to backblaze, the system should check how long it will take using the current provisioned fibre line, cost of overage data, check with the telecom supplier what deals are available.

Wholistically blend all IT spend, from phone lines and data to cell phones and plans.

Offer insurance for quality of the environment - no IT supplier wants to take on liability for the environment, but we could insure it against a certain fault happening.  This could be the full fee, and inside that, we manage the environment as required to never have to pay out.

The general theme of wholistic project management because each specialist is always trying to avoid taking on liability.

Set up partner programms with lots of little vendors, find these little companies and offer them a way to jack in to our services marketplace.

Running Cap on a crude version of this platform might be the first step.

We should ideally supply leased hardware that has functional and uptime and availability guarantees, so you rent the capability, and we insure against any faults.

Just replacing the negotiation for getting work checked and signed off would be easy and valuable.  Insert this in between the relationship between Cap and Brig.
This would be valuable to all parties, as it bridges the knowledge gap, saves Cap money and stress, saves Brig time and results in happier customers.

If we were the deal negotiation platform, then we can escrow the funds and take a cut of that, whilst sorting out issues, providing insurance for completion being done.  Provide independent QA to assure the quality of the work.  Hold back some payment until time has passed to ensure no faults.  Have our own team of standby engineers to deal with faults caused, which is covered by the insurance, and fined to the service provider.

Reputation of the supplier comes into question if the QA fails the work or has to go back and forth a lot.

Is it enough to have a consultant that acts as a cost cutter survivie on reputation, and always broker the service providers ?

All change control needs a rollback plan with cost.  Basically drive the org thru atomic changes.

Being able to chat with the site docs is very useful, and integrates naturally with a marketplace for ideas.  So instead of static site documentation, there is a pool of knowledge about the site, and the bots can present it in a few standard forms, but can also generate new ways of looking at it, and can answer any questions you might have.  As questions get asked, the docs get built out more, so questions deepen the knowledge without creating more work.

Should be able to make a new bot, and quickly attach a large amount of relevant data, as well as link to other bots, so the info stays live, as in we can have triggers that update what our docs say when changes are detected.

Map out money waste, as in license and software and labour that has been sunk into something that gets discarded.
Tally up the labour cost applied to each unit in the network, so we can know where the high mutable value pieces are - these are dangerous pieces as they are costly to rebuild.
Show the costs of IT functions mapped to functions in the business, to see which ones have high yield.

Sustainability with all hardware having a recycling plan and value in place.  Also have an expected failure of each unit based on other units being used by people running our software.

Be able to do whatif analysis, so we can detect the impact of changing a particular app and how it would allow a reconfiguration of the whole environment.  Be able to chat with the docs.

Preservation of the decision making behind each piece.  The doc blanks how things came to be.  The decisions and the votes and opinions from all parties should be encapsulated in the doc, and so we should be able to ask what the history of the doc was, and why it came to be that way.

Arrive an an insurance based model that is transparent as to the costs and the formula.
If we get no call outs, no issues, then we reduce the rates proportionately.
May clearly show the bleed between sites, so an expensive site costs all sites, but only if it could have reasonably happened to the other sites.

Break up signable docs into parts, so the repeated terms and conditions are clear, and the changes are highlighted.  If you agree to a given part and it is included again, it is reduced in priority, and folded on screen.  Comment may be generated on why it is included.  Signatures can be done on just sections, or on the whole doc.  Versions can be notarized on chain.

Make the platform focus on unbiased interpretation of the contract, and automatically ask all kinds of pointed questions of the sender.  Means that if you use our platform, its like having someone on your side all the time, and if you seek a fair deal, you can intro people to the platform.

Set up checklists for all assets, like who owns it, what it cost, what the depreciation on it is.
Then have this model of assets on our repo, all in plain text, all queryable using NL.

Being able to have Quotes that the consumers can view in any way, and the users can set up their own dashboards that are kept in sync.

Place to start is a HAL based IT management system, work with Bri to help them use it internally.  Then move into Cap and up to Prop.  Use this as the place to get our docs and awareness of the environment set, also where to manage the roadmap, and the signed off work requiremets.  Connect monitoring directly to the platform.

Use QR stickers to id equipment, so that reading sends a photo of the equipment, which is useful at the same time.

Incident response, post incident review generation and suggestions.  Root cause analysis questions, and keep bubbling up the root causes to the top.  Review all current procedures and show which root causes are not being mitigated.
