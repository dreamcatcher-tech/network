Idea explosion.
With reasoning follow ups, amalgamation, and further separation.

Instead of reasoning step by step thru things, we should throw up a cloud of ideas, worries, gotchas.

This cloud should come from RAG as well as be generated.

Then once we have a full or stable cloud, we start generating based on that.

The user sees it as a brain storm - an explosion of ideas that get reasoned thru, in parallel often.

Prompts the user adds are just constant thoughts that you want included in the explosion.

Each individual thought is considered in isolation, in parallel, so it has good clarity.

So basically, 100 mini threads should perform better than a single heavy thread ?  A heavy thread could provide oversight of all the mini theads, to avoid local minima type of traps.
