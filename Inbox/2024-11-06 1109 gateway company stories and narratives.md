a venture starts and registers a trademark that is held by the gateway corporation, and then is transferred out at a later date.

freedom of exit is the key - how to exit from the gateway should be very clear, and always prepaid so that exit is free once you have entered.

Be able to set up a separate legal entity that is still controlled by the dreamcatcher rules, but is running like a bare metal server.



gateway company website must be standardized and run by us, the franchise licensee.

We would use the gateway to set up our own franchise management system ?

Comms from the ventures must include the registered company name and a link to the gateway website.  Or at least the venture needs to present a standard form website, with 'powered by' or something at the bottom.

Gateway is there to leverage AI to reduce the barriers of starting a business while exceeding the compliance and quality standards by sharing the common aspects of transacting in the ai age.

Then list out all the common parts of launching a business that we support.  Show the stages of various companies inside our gateway.

We would then provide a board resolution for each venture, granting them the right to sign contracts for the trading as name they have chosen.

We should be able to use our own legal services pool to review contracts and provide legal advice that is rapid, cheap, binding, and defended by an insurance pool of sorts.

Provide our own portal for due dilligence on the other parties that are being contracted with.  Connect the relationship on the relationship map.  This is like a port mapping for a NAT gateway.

Inside the corporate lan, entities can use additional protocols to communicate, like once everyone has signed a confidentiality module, these can be used to flag discussions as private.

Provide upgrade paths, so that semver can be applied to the contracts, so people can upgrade them automatically, or know they are in conflict.

So we'd have easy services for registering trademarks, dns names, and other complex but common services.  Have a checklist for stability / maturity of a venture.  Dashboard showing its depth of connection.

Over a network of gateways, we should be able to provide reliable operations.
Easily transport to different jurisdictions, or apply a concept to another jurisdiction without your direct effort being required.

We would mint the gateway a medallion to enable membership on the dreamcatcher.  They would sign a binding contract to the terms of the dreamcatcher allowing anyone to attack them if they fail in their duties.

Venture name search, we would help search across multiple jurisdictions, and also have dns name searches occuring as well.  If you do not trademark, we can also keep a watch on registrations to ensure you are notified on changes.

Individuals would be like lambda functions, corporations would be like servers.

book keeping and accounting, filing reports - these are shared by all, and only need to pay for what you use, and since you use our software, the cost is nearly zero.  The liability load is like CPU load or ram usage.  Once a server is full we start a new one.

profit share of the hosting company is how attribution gets paid out.

No assets are ever stored inside the company, so a legal dispute would result in shutdown if unresolved.

Allow individuals to use the company, and trading as is their personal name.

If its 12GBP to register a subsidiary, then we might as well create a sub for each venture.
