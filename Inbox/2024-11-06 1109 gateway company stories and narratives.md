a venture starts and registers a trademark that is held by the gateway corporation, and then is transferred out at a later date.

freedom of exit is the key - how to exit from the gateway should be very clear, and always prepaid so that exit is free once you have entered.



gateway company website must be standardized and run by us, the franchise licensee.

We would use the gateway to set up our own franchise management system ?

Comms from the ventures must include the registered company name and a link to the gateway website.  Or at least the venture needs to present a standard form website, with 'powered by' or something at the bottom.
