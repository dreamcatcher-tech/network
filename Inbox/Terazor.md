# TERAZOR Platform Design Document

## Overview

TERAZOR ("The Razor") is an agentic platform designed to streamline data ingestion processes for local councils, enabling efficient handling, transformation, and management of diverse static data streams. The platform sets the stage for future enhancements toward dynamic, real-time data management and the development of traditional and AI-driven applications that directly leverage the data held within the platform.

## Problem Statement

A significant challenge in asset management arises from the disconnect between system constructors and those responsible for long-term asset management. Ideally, a "golden thread" of structured, standardized data would consistently flow from initial creation through asset lifecycle management. However, this rarely occurs due to fragmented responsibilities, inconsistent vendor data practices, and legacy systems with varying data standards. Additionally, upstream contracted data is typically haphazard, resulting in inevitably haphazard final handover data. Councils consequently face sudden, unmanageable ingestion workloads, causing operational stress, strain on hiring practices, and difficulties maintaining standards. Scaling teams up or down in response to these shock loads is costly and inefficient, often resulting in substantial backlogs—some extending 18 months or longer—delaying dependent projects and diverting valuable resources from other initiatives. TERAZOR addresses this challenge by retrospectively solving the ingestion process—transforming historical, unstructured data into structured consistency.

## System Architecture

### Data Accumulation

Raw data is aggregated into a centralized repository, supporting accumulation from multiple sources including:

- Manual uploads (PDFs, CAD files, Excel, Word documents)
    
- Email communications and attachments
    
- Third-party system integrations
    

Internally, all ingested data is converted into a flexible "Universal Common Schema" which adapts dynamically and rapidly to changes in incoming data formats, bypassing slow, committee-based standardization.

### Workstations

Workstations are nodes within workflow diagrams where ingestion tasks occur. Each workstation can be occupied either by a human, an automated AI agent, or a hybrid of both:

- **QA Workstation:** Quality assurance and data verification.
    
- **Transformation Workstations:** Specific manual or automated data transformation processes.
    

### Human-to-Agent Transition and Incremental Adaptability

Initially, humans perform all data conversion tasks within designated workstations. TERAZOR observes these human tasks, incrementally training AI agents to automate repetitive ingestion activities. Humans may assist agents to leverage economic output, creating a hybrid workflow tailored to each task’s complexity. Each task solved by the platform incrementally improves overall capabilities, resulting in a continually adapting system. Specific tasks solved today evolve into generalized capabilities tomorrow, ensuring continual improvement and adaptability.

## Agentic Labor Marketplace

TERAZOR facilitates a secure, vetted, global, decentralized labor market for ingestion tasks:

- **Job Advertisement:** Globally accessible task postings for secure, vetted outsourced labor.
    
- **Reputation Management:** Worker skill and reliability tracking for quality assurance.
    
- **Economic Model:** Clients set prices for both manual and agent-developed jobs, allowing flexible balancing of project budget constraints and turnaround times. This model significantly enhances cost control, with payments charged only upon job completion.
    

## Value Proposition

TERAZOR significantly enhances council asset management by:

- Accelerating the pace of data ingestion and reducing asset backlog.
    
- Offering elastic, secure, and vetted manual processing capabilities through a scalable global workforce.
    
- Incrementally introducing AI automation, continuously improving efficiency and reducing human resource costs.
    

## Pricing Model

- **Installation and Setup:** Minimal or free initial setup to facilitate easy and incremental adoption.
    
- **Usage-Based Revenue:** Charges per completed ingestion task or agent use, including a modest platform fee (~10%).
    

## Phased Implementation Strategy

1. **Phase 1 (Initial Deployment):**
    
    - Establish core repository and workstation processes.
        
    - Conduct initial testing with representative data sets to confirm the effectiveness of automated ingestion processes.
        
    - Begin human-driven static data ingestion workflows.
        
2. **Phase 2 (Agent Introduction):**
    
    - Observe and capture human processes to train AI agents.
        
    - Gradually automate simpler ingestion tasks.
        
3. **Phase 3 (Market Expansion):**
    
    - Open labor tasks globally, establishing robust, secure, and vetted reputation systems.
        
4. **Phase 4 (Autonomous Scaling):**
    
    - Continually refine AI agents for complex ingestion tasks.
        
    - Expand platform capabilities based on accumulated insights.
        

## Future Capabilities

- Integration with IoT and sensor data, enabling TERAZOR to serve as a real-time data management platform, providing the infrastructure's "nervous system" or "heartbeat" to monitor and proactively manage city assets.

- Development of traditional and AI-driven applications natively harnessing TERAZOR-held data.
    
- Proactive, AI-driven decision-making for asset maintenance.
    
- Automated compliance and regulatory reporting.
    

TERAZOR provides councils with a flexible, scalable, secure, and adaptive system, efficiently managing evolving asset data landscapes and positioning them competitively in a rapidly digitizing environment.
