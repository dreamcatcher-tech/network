currency link between crypto and mining where the revenue stream is attribution - a payment for IP contribution.

Every blockchain has launched with a currency inside it - the legal tender of the chain, which seems to simplify all actions, and gives it an identity.

If we launched a company to build a blockchain, and showed that the currency was, instead of relying on currency inflation to be the payback for investment, or instead of relying on being the dominant miner to get payback, instead the mining fee is a payment for the intellectual contributions, like software, and so long as the currency is used, no further effort is required.

It is also not inflationary.  Also encourages later contributions.

And not just for the processing of payments, but for the value exchanged, so if we contribute pieces that enable a CRM, then we should get a portion of all usage payments collected.

This makes the network function like one huge company, that is highly intelligent and adaptive.
