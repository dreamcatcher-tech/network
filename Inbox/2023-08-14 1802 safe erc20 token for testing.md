If we could use a token we had control of during the testing phase, like a representative token, then we could have ability to correct things when they break.

We could be the total controller of this token.

This could be liened erc1155 tokens.

Can restrict its usage to inside the dreamether contract.

Require soulbound holding to be able to transfer it.

Would give us a safety net around the initial funding.

Can use this like story points, where individuals can be granted story funds, and they can assign them to tasks as they see fit.

Can make it a child of some other task, so scoped dollars, where the top level tasks are known.  This can be used to present a roadmap, where the structure is encapsulated in the coins for each task.
