If we could use a token we had control of during the testing phase, like a representative token, then we could have ability to correct things when they break.

We could be the total controller of this token.

This could be liened erc1155 tokens.

Can restrict its usage to inside the dreamether contract.

Require soulbound holding to be able to transfer it.

Would give us a safety net around the initial funding.
