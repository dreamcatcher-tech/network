When a drone gets called, its exit function needs to be called, so we can stop it and return the results.

For testing this would be the location of the tps report.

When a drone is set up as a function, we want to say what the agent is, and what the exit function is.

So the drone agent should say what its exit function is, or it should be a special function that all drones call to signal exit.
