Model out the prize we seek, the the projections of gain.

Go looking for the individuals that the system calculates we are better finding.

So we model our chosen approach, pick the people and the prizes, and then iterate and learn.

Condition is that everyone has to be self financed, as they are shooting for equity gains.

We are primarily a learning system, that adapts to its environment.

So we need to build this core infrastructure, and then give the public access to parts of it, but also we use the private part to launch the undercover type of vertical integration tasks.
