If we generate some expected usage from a system, then we can show some expected attribution tables.

Lets people play around with what things they can change, and get some theoretical attribution outputs.

So pick some reasonable guesses of input parameters, and then have the system say how much a given person will get.  Let you explore the model via chat.

Provide insights to help nudge you towards things that generate the best value for you.
