make the jsr packages work in bolt.new

cache the latest pulls in opfs.
- store the latest commit scope and the object count in the opfs too.

edits of data - show how the other clients see these changes

merging in changes 
- edit the sectors and the geocoding and still have mw changes merge in
- clobber customer data edits that occured 
- or! store the translated customer on edit, and just highlight that it is different to what's in moneyworks, and allow a revert to go back to what the moneyworks version is
