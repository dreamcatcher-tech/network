When making front ends, because the way to connect to the server is so loose, it is easy to make mistakes or make things that are difficult to understand, or unfamiliar.

So with a framework like artifact, if all the docs and patterns were tightly included for the LLM to process well.

So instead of attempting many different ways to connect to the server, it follows a standard way, and then the server implementation can allow different allowed ways.

Basically if we decrease the freedom available then we decrease the errors, so long as we can still get what we want out of it.

docs gen that has evals for LLM interpretation, so its a service that takes your docs and your code and parses it into docs that read well for LLMs
