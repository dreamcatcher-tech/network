Make an eink display with a camera on it that mounts in the laundry, and you can trigger with your voice, where it does transcription triggered by a wake word and then answers questions about your laundry.  You can hold clothes up to the camera and it will process it.  You can show it the contents of your laundry cupboard and it can recommend what items and how much to use.  Tell it the model of your washing machine and it will figure out what settings you should use.  Can recognize the machine just from a photo.
