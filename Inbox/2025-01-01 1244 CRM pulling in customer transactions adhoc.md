We might be able to not pull in many transactions initially, but as the client requests it, we pull it in, and if they page thru the data, we pull it in as requested.

Removing moneyworks completely would then mean we could implement our own data storage format, and then ditch the xml storage completely at some point.

So we would keep the xml on a dedicated branch somewhere ?
