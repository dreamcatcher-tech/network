All the lowcode offerings need access to a cloud hosted server of some sort.  Some permit hosting such a server locally.  Our offerings would have no server anywhere, but still offer lowcode solutions.

Debuggability is high since we can recreate any scenario to troubleshoot.

Versioning seems easier ?

Users can become coders since each app can be forked easily and modified.

Might be easier to partner with an existing player to offer this bolt on tech ?

We can wrap all api queries and cache those queries.

High compute load can be delivered as all clients can cooperate for storage and computation.

? Can an api service, with enough query data, use an AI to estimate what the response is likely to be, and stop needing the original service or provide cached queries ?

? Can general events, like when a specific client will want a meeting, be fed into AI to guess at when the next event is likely to occur ?
