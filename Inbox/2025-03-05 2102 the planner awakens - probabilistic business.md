We would make an agent that is constantly trying to box outcomes or activities that we might undertake so that it can theorize about all the foreseeable outcomes. It then gives them a probability, a cost, and a payout. It looks at the capital we have and sees where we should apply it. Humans can still twiddle with this a bit, but the fundamental calculation is still the same and it should be done regardless of what the humans think. This means that it can be done across a vast many opportunities as the people who use the system form a collective unit and can tackle millions of concurrent opportunities using these AI models to think in a very clear way. 

These probabilities are used to inform investors, some of whom may be algorithmic only, so that people in the dream catcher can call on large amounts of capital fast provided they can demonstrate good Bayesian reasoning as to why what they're doing is a good spend. 

This thing is watching everything that happens and keeps updating its theories using all the latest information. It begins concocting experiments that are low cost to prove a certain thing. It accepts debate from people who suggest that a different experiment might be better or that the conclusions being drawn from one given experiment are invalid or incorrect. 

Here's one: we basically have this network effect of people arguing about what are the best ways to carry out Bayesian thinking with very calculated sample experiments to validate assumptions about a market or technology or a thing and then have very rapid ways to scale that up. If the opportunity turns out to be proven by the experiments to be increasing in chance of good yield, this good yield would also send a signal for others to bring in capital, talent, and to look for other places to apply these inner understandings. 

By having the machine think of all possible outcomes and pick likely ones, we are in effect proposing questions that the machine can't answer that are almost like a physics question or physics theory in the business world. We don't have an all-encompassing model for how business works, but we can reduce many critical decisions down to simple facts or things about the world that we can do an experiment on and it will come back a certain way. This is reusable because the same fundamental reasons still apply. 

This bot starts to become like a very experienced business person where it knows these rules about how the world works. It has experiments to back it up. It's constantly doing these experiments. It's seeing new experiments come in. It's tweaking some of its decisions in part to test or revalidate old experiments to make sure they still hold or hold in this realm. It's like a very big business person
