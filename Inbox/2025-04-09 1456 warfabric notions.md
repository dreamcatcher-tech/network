if we could generate actual product, and it performed better than existing items, then we could sell these as actual items to the military.

This might result in a closed network request from the USA.

profit margins that are set to a formula - th epurpose of profit is sustainability, so have a formula that dials up or down the margin like an insurance premium that the buyer pays, and have it be calculated in an automated sense.

The goal is autonomous project managers, so they deliver products using AI for the lowest cost, fastest time, highest quality.  Fastest feedback loop possible.

having a direct connection between products and sensor data is key, allows us to get fastest possible iteration, the lab is the frontline usage, and can make consumer products in the model too.

Ambient attribution is a great model to set the price of things, so that profit can be charged respectably for some rather solemn and morally sensitive products and services.

Hopefully can set up mfg cells, since those problems are just innovation problems themselves, where we can set up logistics, testing, rapid mfg, to get the loop speed up and make the items as well as test the items as close to the front line as possible, with high resilience since we can set up replacement units quickly, and hard to hit since small and mobile.
