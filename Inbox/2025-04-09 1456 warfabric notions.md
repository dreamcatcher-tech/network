if we could generate actual product, and it performed better than existing items, then we could sell these as actual items to the military.

This might result in a closed network request from the USA.

profit margins that are set to a formula - th epurpose of profit is sustainability, so have a formula that dials up or down the margin like an insurance premium that the buyer pays, and have it be calculated in an automated sense.

The goal is autonomous project managers, so they deliver products using AI for the lowest cost, fastest time, highest quality.  Fastest feedback loop possible.

having a direct connection between products and sensor data is key, allows us to get fastest possible iteration, the lab is the frontline usage, and can make consumer products in the model too.

Ambient attribution is a great model to set the price of things, so that profit can be charged respectably for some rather solemn and morally sensitive products and services.

Hopefully can set up mfg cells, since those problems are just innovation problems themselves, where we can set up logistics, testing, rapid mfg, to get the loop speed up and make the items as well as test the items as close to the front line as possible, with high resilience since we can set up replacement units quickly, and hard to hit since small and mobile.

A key weapon should be the auto-trigger, which is a device that mounts on any given gun and can control the trigger. It uses computer vision to understand, based on the motion of the gun and the recognized target and the motion of the target, when is the optimum time to pull the trigger. Human points at the trigger, and we take advantage of the natural wavering of the human so that eventually it will be at the precise firing point.

Now we can set tunables for any given situation where the drone can wait for the perfect time or we can set a close enough ratio because the chances of us being able to paint across the target again are quite slim depending on if it's a close-quarters combat fight or if it's a drone that's coming in. We can look at the distance of the drone and say, "Well, we kind of need to be very precise here," or as it gets closer we can take more urgent shots.  

There is a data deluge coming.  The modern war machine produces vast data.  many items are constructed without docs and without handover, whilst at the same time, huge amounts of money are spent, with very little oversight.

This will present a shock at the front line where the data will overrun the ingestion, and people will start resorting to overflow tactics like massive buckets and lakes. Processing this at a rapid rate securely, confidently, reliably, and accurately - this is big business. That queue processing where you may not be able to hit every job, but you just can hit more and more and more. That's the key. 

So even just moving away from individual inboxes and going to a global inbox where everyone else's inbox is a subset of it, but the messages are task-related, means that people can easily take over from other people and act on behalf of them rather than asking people to afford stuff around and send it along. It's just this is the come ponies email inbox they can be tiered to different privacy settings depending on what different concerns are like health-related matters or pricing related or things like that. But this can also be filtered per message so the message can be transformed to blank out the sensitive data and still retain the useful information. 

The ability to conduct rapid polling of citizens, votes, rapid new info - this is critical.
Being able to inventory the whole nation, continously, this is vital in the new theatre.  A nation prepping for war, should suffer no inconveniences - in fact they should have an improved quality of life - a better digital life than they have right now.
