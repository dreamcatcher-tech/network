Push that our partners are building a napp.

So basically, for the SEND projects, we are building napps that can be used on our platform to process data safely.

Our platform provides the data guarantees, and we have several SEND efforts that use our platform to experiment with ways the openai API can be used in these fields.

napps are packages for an ai agent centric platform.
