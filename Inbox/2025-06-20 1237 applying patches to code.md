based on [[2025-06-19 1021 decision trees for code]]

If we want to take a particular step in the decision tree and apply it somewhere else, then we should be able to use the LLMs to smudge that strategy onto whatever path or state we're in in the other tree path, so we can get away from requiring precise commits and move to doing commits that are about intents or patches or examples. The LLM applies it based on whatever is in the codebase which can have changed over time. 

We would expect that these common types of patches would form a library that could be applied at many different stages. Learnings would be developed from each patch, and so this sort of prompt-patch concept starts to take form where these are the primordial elements that code is made from - before it's a finished, tested, consumable package, it exists as these smudgy patch concepts or patch ideas.
