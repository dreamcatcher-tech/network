this would return the file paths as a big fat doc. 

the bot would size it right first, by tentatively calling it, until it was convinced it had it right.

but I'm not convinced this is better than just browsing around the files ?

possibly we could use embeddings to get chunks out of the files to get relevant snippets a bit better ?
