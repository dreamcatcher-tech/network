Make a graphql interface to query records effectively.

Searching for a customer based on a name, or some thing about them, we should be able to filter and rank by containing instances of a string ?

Make index files that hold all of each field within them ?

Index could use the dir hash of the git folder it points to, and it builds up this data in the background, rather than requiring db hits to pull everything up ?
