We should have strategies for applying various standard instructions, like rename, refactor, simplify.

These are regular things that have instructions that humans give to other humans, to learn how to do these things well and do a complete and thorough job, like when renaming, check that nowhere else has anything close to it.

Run multiple strategies concurrently, then apply the results.
