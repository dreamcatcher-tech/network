If you take a photo of your food when you eat it, we should be able to determine at what time the nutrients of this meal will come online for you. We can perform calibration tests to make sure we know the timings of your body. We can then sort of forecast the future and say "well at this time your energy levels will be X, your sleepiness will be Y, your fat burn will be Z". By getting these real-time feedbacks, possibly calibrated with the use of a smartwatch or some other tool, we can help you eat for a future energy level goal otherwise it ends up being a bit hit and miss or shooting in the dark.
