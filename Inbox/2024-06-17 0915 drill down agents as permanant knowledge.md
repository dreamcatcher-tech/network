The agents may find the knowledge atoms they have belong somewhere else.
They could be put in large pools of similar topics, or one large flat pool.
Views can be constructed that process the facts to make them more searchable for a given purpose.

In asking questions the agent may refine other facts in the fact pool.
The agent can be reused in other settings, since the knowledge refinement is valuable.

It might not be the bot that is passed around, but rather the finished doc, or just the fact pool in its altered state.

The fact pool should support staking, where different people accept and stake against facts, which settles disputes, and also gives incentive to provide accurate data.

a knowledge base could be the same as a customer records.
Large numbers of text info that represents different things.
