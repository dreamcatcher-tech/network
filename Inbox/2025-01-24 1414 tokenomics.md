Grab all the recent token raises and analyze them, extract a common dashboard for them.

Score them on standard metrics.

Measure their rate of change, and their ability to pivot into AI land.

Probably need a standard token to interface to the rest of the world, so we'd pool a bunch of attribution and issue a regular type of currency.

Goal is a compute marketplace.

Show the system working and lay out the tasks we need for completion.

Write a white paper with the formulas for the token.
