So we would take all the ways in which we want a covenant to be looked up, and generate a natural language ruleset.

Then we would appraise that ruleset for completeness, and have some test examples.

Then, our implementation modules would be tested in isolation, plus some integration examples that use the whole thing together.

This would make an otherwise confusing thing start by being documented, justified, and designed, then the design integrated with the rest of the system, and only after that, the code being generated by human or machine or both.
