mcp-comptuers and mcp-agents are all about talking to the infrastructure of fly.

the agent.toml is stored as part of the machine config, in a file.

now we need mcp-faces that is a server running on the actual running agent.

there is a default face, so an interaction pointed at an agent without specifying the face would just start a new default face ?
