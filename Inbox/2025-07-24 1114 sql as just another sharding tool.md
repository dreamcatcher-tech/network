if the artifact model allows plugin sharding methods, then we can front a particular folder with a sql database.

So to access, you would put the driver or translator in front of the file system, and the translator would then be spoken to in one way, like sql, and would interact with the data using git language.

it might be that any successful file system on the planet can be represented in this way.
