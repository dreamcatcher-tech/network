This could be baked into the toolset we make to produce widgets. 

How it works is that the stories or the intent of the application is built up from conversation with the architect or the human who is building it. And then the bot will generate a series of stories by which it can exercise the system as though a human would. And so it scores it. And gives its feedback, but it can not only find faults or bugs and attempt to fix them or tweak them, but on each component it can suggest other ways that the intent might be met, and it can make exploratory forks. 

and so the idea is that we would make a system that could automatically componentize these widgets. Although a widget may be enough of a component in itself. But the models are trained and incentivized to keep the component size small. Rather than having large apps with many stories, it will know how to break apart files functionality.
