Publish filesystems, artifacts, and chats, and then get stucks as feedback about these things.

The feedback is ai generated based on humans input.

This is the key element of connection, which is a thrill for people, as they have found connection with other people in some way.  This is the social network addiction.

So if we allow people to make documents together, as well as just publish, and to make bots together, receive feedback and funding, then things get fun.

This is the hook that gets things going.

Particularly if you can produce stucks, which can be turned into NFTs.
