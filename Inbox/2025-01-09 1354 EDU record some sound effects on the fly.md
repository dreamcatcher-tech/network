So push a button and say what the sound effect is, then make the noise, then the bot gets that inserted as a new tool that it can call upon, like an extra enum in the tool that it can grab.

so sessions with kids can be like a dj, where you have to make multiple sounds, fill in story paths, guide image generations, steerage interpretation.

If you could offload this to some other people, then for their $x per hour, they could manage this for like, 10 concurrent kids, as well as watch for dangers using cameras assisted by AI.

Like a remote nanny service.
