it is probably trained on tools like git, and so giving it something foreign is more confusing than giving it exactly git.

We are now actually, with stateful serverside, acting exactly as git, but we virtualize the index / staging area.

dangerously, if we are close to git, but slightly different, the model will often stutter.

So the write tools should be filesystem writing.
the navigation should be git branch navigations.
the execution should be clear and simple

tree is a bit special, 

browsing tools, load tools, unload tools - these are the simple deep research style tools.

we could make a bot that crawls tools and loads them just to test their suitability before returning a result that it has checked, guaranteeing the tool choice.
