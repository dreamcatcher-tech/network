Use AI to grind thru patents and find ones that conflict, but build up an entity map and find holes in the coverage.

The holes can have patents rapidly drafted, so the effort is small, but the coverage is good.

Any new idea can also be reconciled against the patent database, in realtime, so you know what collision you are going to have in what markets.

Can help you get around them, and can help appraise the value for the patents.
