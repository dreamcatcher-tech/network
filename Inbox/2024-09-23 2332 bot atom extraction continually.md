I want to be able to have a system where I can be continually chatting to multiple bots and background processes are pulling in all the novel ideas that came in and listing them in a set of atoms that represent key independent points of knowledge about the topic I'm currently working on. I should be able to connect up other threads to this particular pool but most importantly checking processes should run to make sure that no thread includes something that was missed. In this way I can have multiple conversations and have multiple versions of output generated by bots perhaps on purpose in parallel where several different versions of different temperature are constructed and the compression process takes in all of these different threads and turns them into standard coherent atoms of knowledge making sure that nothing gets lost along the way and that these atoms are continuously being ranked and re-ranked every time they change to offer priority and added clarity.

Handle multiple people contributing ideas concurrently.
