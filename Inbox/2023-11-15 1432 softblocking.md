Considerable time is taken up by crushing pulses and processing interpulses.

We can avoid all that by not committing the pulse until all the internal transactions have exhausted, and then sealing the whole app complex in one shot, with one signature.

In the meantime, the hashing could be happening on separate threads too.

So long as there is activity happening, and nothing has ended up waiting on an external call, and not too long has elapsed, then we should keep on processing.

Means that we can very rapidly process actions that are purely internal, rather than internal chain activity being delayed by blocking processes.
