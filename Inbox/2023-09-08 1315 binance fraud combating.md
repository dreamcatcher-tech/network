Provide a set of tokens on chain that represent wrapped versions of the chain assets, with these having a traceability requirement on the unwrapping.  Unwrapping needs a timeout.  

If authorities require, the asset underneath can be liquidated and the wrapper burned.

If you trade between other holders that have kyc, then the burn cannot happen, and the liability moves on to them by way of their soulbound token.

Asset backing is auditable on chain.  If no authority requires a liquidation hold, 
Regulation is always publicised, and enacted by an external party.
Legal funds can pop up that argue with any liquidations.

Can have exchanges where people can swap you for unwrapped assets, but they take the risk that they might get liquidated, and so we should see a 3% premium charged.

Some actions can be mirrored, such as lido staking.  If the wrapped token is entered into the wrapped lido contract, then the backed asset is moved into those contracts too.  So you can earn interest and do other things with it, so long as the underlying asset is not destroyed, or is not divided.

Could put a guarantee in a stablecoin against these wrapped coins to get the asset out.

This seems like the only solution to give people on chain access, but to keep the fiat regulators happy, since crypto can just disappear, and we do not want to freeze the funds.

## Satoshi
On satoshi island we have the exact same problem - we need to prove regulation but we want to remain connected to the utility of crypto.
