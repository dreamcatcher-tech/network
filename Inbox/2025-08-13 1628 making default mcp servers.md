`https://example.com/@dreamcatcher/chats` could be used to reference any npm package at all.

So if you browse to that page, we can show you a raw, default mcp server that exposes the tools that this napp presents.

If you are logged in, then it gives you access to the resources you have in your account.

repo, branch, path - these are not as easily mapped up using just paths, so would need params.
