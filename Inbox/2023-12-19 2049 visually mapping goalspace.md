Using vector tools we can visually show where goalspace is for different apps, so we can see how well clustered the goals are.  This clustering is what should be named a feature, since clearly this is what the people want - the centroid is the feature itself.  It might be possible to compress goalspace by making sure everything nearby can be met by fewer helps, making it more compact and succinct to solve things.
