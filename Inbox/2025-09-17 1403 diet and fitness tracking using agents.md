there would be a repo that held the base info.

a queue of info that needs to be processed.

start an agent for each piece, decide if we can run in parallel or not, have a queue manager agent that continually curates the queue, and fires up agents to do jobs.

the queue is just a data structure on disk.

so this thing would be off doing deep research each time you asked a question, and would store relevant source data that it found referential, and it would update its recommendation to your program.

it would look at what you had done, and calculate the expected impact.

if you send a photo of what you just ate, it would do some calculations on that.

give it access to your spending and it will deduce what you probably bought and ate, and work out impact over the next few hours, next few days, weeks, ultimately years.

its job is to work out impact, and provide meaningful steering, while talking about your goals.
