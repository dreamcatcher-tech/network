If we make NFSv3 be the way by which we virtualize git massively as in [[2025-09-02 0922 need a git fuse|git fuse]] then we can also point the fuse at a particular agents version of it, effectively layering it.

It can be shared with restrictions on what can be accessed or not.

basically any blockchain should be able to be browsed using this nfs model, because why do you need these things in the browser anyway ? the remote computer build up of a network of agents should feel like a local computer - snappy, infinite resources.

the computer is a single permission boundary.  everything there is under control of the same sovereign entity.

those entities can be composite, where multiple entities are running all or part of the computer in lockstep.
