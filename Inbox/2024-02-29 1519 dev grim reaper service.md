Make an uber like service, where you can hire a dev, burstably, they come with a connection to the wider dreamcatcher, and they can use the system to help the company, like map out its purpose, engage AI tools, and break work up into externalizable functions.

Incentive is they get a cut of work that gets farmed out that they helped set up, so incentives are there to make them want to put more work into the dreamcatcher.

Owners like it since they can hire and fire rapidly, and can process applications using AI.

If you want to run a hiring campaign thru us, we can screen all the CVs, and do testing for you, plus hire the person so when they're ready, you pay us, can fire them instantly, and we handle all the other stuff.

HR and performance is managed thru the app, so the app needs to see the jobs that were assigned and the outputs cleanly.  The staff are trained that if they don't use this app, then we don't pay them.  Starts off our visibility into the company.
