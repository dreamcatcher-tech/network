**Recording Studio and Live Collaboration**

- **Core Problem**  
    Humans lose valuable mental flow when forced to recall past details or re-explain ideas. Poor memory and manual repetition waste time and effort. Once creative momentum is interrupted, regaining that state is difficult.
    
- **Design Goal**  
    Create a continuous, real-time capture system that lets individuals brain-dump ideas without pausing. All spoken content is transcribed instantly and stored securely for later reference.
    
- **Key Benefits**
    
    - **Reduced Cognitive Load**: By offloading memory-intensive tasks to an automated recorder, people can stay in creative flow.
    - **No Missed Information**: Transcripts remain available even if someone steps away, has a poor connection, or needs to switch context.
    - **Collaborative Insight**: Peers can see each other’s transcriptions in real-time, accelerating shared understanding and minimizing repeated explanations.
    - **Offline Resilience**: If network issues arise, local storage ensures no data is lost. Once reconnected, transcripts sync automatically.
- **Added Collaboration**  
    By monitoring peer actions and transcriptions, everyone remains in sync. Even if you miss a live conversation, you can read the transcript and quickly catch up, preserving the full history of ideas without requiring others to repeat themselves.

**High-Level Architecture**

1. **Client-Side Audio Capture & Real-Time Transcription**
    
    - Use the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) for immediate partial transcriptions.
    - Store audio chunks in the browser (via `MediaRecorder` + `IndexedDB`) for offline playback and future syncing.
    - Detect utterance boundaries with the `SpeechRecognition` API end-of-speech event.
2. **Local Storage & Sync**
    
    - Maintain a local transcription database (IndexedDB) that mirrors server state when online.
    - Track record status with color-coded states (e.g., local only, pending sync, synced, error).
    - A background service worker can push unsynced recordings and transcript segments when a connection is detected.
3. **Server-Side Services**
    
    - Provide a robust transcription endpoint (e.g., using Whisper or a custom STT engine) to re-transcribe audio for better accuracy.
    - Allow concurrent transcription engines for side-by-side comparison or fallback.
    - Enable user-defined transcription configurations (language models, specialized vocab).
4. **Re-Transcription Workflow**
    
    - Users can trigger a re-transcription if new definitions or specialized vocab is provided.
    - The server reprocesses the stored audio, updates transcripts, and returns new text segments.
    - Maintain version history for each transcript to revert or compare.
5. **Collaboration & Sharing**
    
    - Each recording file can be shared via generated links or user-based permissions.
    - Peer-to-peer sync could be implemented using WebRTC data channels for faster local sharing or collaborative editing.
6. **Playback & Speed Control**
    
    - In-browser audio player with adjustable playback speed.
    - Keep the user’s preferred speed in local storage and apply it across all recordings.
7. **Voice Gating**
    
    - Use real-time audio analysis to detect external audio signals.
    - Mute or pause transcription if audio from another source is detected above a threshold, preventing echo or double transcription.
8. **Token Counting & Meta Info**
    
    - Track approximate token usage for cost estimates (if using a paid STT service).
    - Display usage stats per session or per transcript for user awareness.

This setup ensures robust real-time capture, flexible re-transcription, offline resilience, and easy collaboration.
