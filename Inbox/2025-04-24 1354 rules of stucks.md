shouldn't be able to mark a stuck as solved, its just the target of solutions.

stucks and fixes.

fixes can be partial or full - it really is up to the consumer to choose if it fixes or not.

like stuckoverflow, but if you choose, you can see any layout of messages you like, including ones you fully created.

each comment can be upvoted, blanked from existence, edited by others - how the thread of conversation goes is dependent on the observer, not on a central authority.
