Rather than the pain of generating an app that can do detailed turn by turn nav, we could just speak using NL to the driver, telling them where to go ?

Give them push to talk ability, so they ask questions and get answers on anything, not just directions.

If we had cameras in the trucks, we could recall images of other trucks in similar positions to help the driver.

If it is chat, then they can have a single device, with a single button, to do all things related to their job.

Ultimately once we have vision integrated, it can take a look out for bins that are curbside and immediately pull up the records and suggest an account to use for the ad hoc pickup.
