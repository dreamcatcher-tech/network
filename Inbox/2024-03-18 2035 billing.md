When a commit is done is the place to track billing.

Billing should roll up to root, so we can always know definitively how much a user has spent, and it is interogatable in the git logs.

We can write an unlimited number of child chains without bottleneck if we use keys as params.  So all children would write their head commit, and the current charges they have incurred.  

A sum action continually bubbles this up higher until the root.

Billing should be logged inside each commit ?
