nApps, which are written entirely using prompt engineering, can write incredibly complex systems.
Then they can plug in to APIs.
Also can display widgets, which you can build yourself, or consume part of.

Some of the coding of these components can be done in the tool, if it can run in the browser.

The bot can interpret code requests and code urls and can loop around until tests pass.

When the human rejects something, it learns about the reasons why, and turn that in to a test which it must pass.

Passing tests is attempted in parallel using multiple models with multiple temperature settings including web searching.
As valuable knowledge is found, it adds to the notes.

Worst case it presents a tightly formed test package as a stuck to be published to the network.
