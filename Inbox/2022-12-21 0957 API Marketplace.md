Make a marketplace where required APIs can be requested, bought, and sold

If we provide API wrappers that are blockchains, then people can make and publish apps that do not require the devs to run servers at all, since the client is responsible.  Servers also do not need to hold any secret material, since the client handles all this.

Seems a better way to let devs build apps, since they get paid anyway, and get paid when people remix things as well.  NFT tooling is a good way to get blockchain familiar people involved in the project.

## AI marshalled API interactions
And so, being able to modify an API call in the library of all available APIs can be done by people citing occasions where an error occurred, which the appraiser is capable of validating, and then people submitting solutions that get around that solution whilst also passing the test and passing a random sampling of other API calls that are made, possibly with a distance function from the submitter to know that we're not being gamed.

Errors would be made public for automated inspection and human improvement of the difficult ones.

## Examples
### hotpot.ai image generation
Request that we want a service integration with them.
Code is made.
Public version of the service is created.
Library can be run privately, or members can use the public version.
Public version handles billing in one place, offers sharing of results, offers cache, offers uptime monitoring of the service.
Code is available for sale, pay per use.  Any time a payment goes thru our gateways, a portion of that goes to the api gateways.
Test chains auto generated for code proving with some dummy data.
Service can now be included in an app using standard blockchain api.
Offline versions of your api calls can be downloaded and used as a cache.
Certification of results gives provable api performance monitoring.
Errors in the api can be tackled by workers in the api marketplace, so it keeps your code maintained.
Errors are replayable.
API key management and rotation.
Small group teaming where you have a cluster of people sharing the api key.
Invite a competitive service to appear that does the equivalent thing, better - starts by knowing the api shape, 
Allow interchange between multiple similar apis, then make a pure service that targets the standard api directly, rather than a translation.
Offer shared  / multi target api service, where results from multiple sources are combined.
