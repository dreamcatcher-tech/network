Request that we want a service integration with them.
Code is made.
Public version of the service is created.
Library can be run privately, or members can use the public version.
Public version handles billing in one place, offers sharing of results, offers cache, offers uptime monitoring of the service.
Code is available for sale, pay per use.  Any time a payment goes thru our gateways, a portion of that goes to the api gateways.
Test chains auto generated for code proving with some dummy data.
Service can now be included in an app using standard blockchain api.
Offline versions of your api calls can be downloaded and used as a cache.
Certification of results gives provable api performance monitoring.
Errors in the api can be tackled by workers in the api marketplace, so it keeps your code maintained.
Errors are replayable.
