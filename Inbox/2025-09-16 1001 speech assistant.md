the voice interface should be driving a deeper set of background processes.

it should have a background task that tries to check the background accuracy of all the things it said, or how it interpreted your question.

so that later, if som eprocessing shows up an error, it might jump in and say something about it, like lightly checking if the user would like to hear the correction.
