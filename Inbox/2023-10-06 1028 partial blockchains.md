If we made a system that had some aspects of a blockchain, but ran on our trusted servers, it could satisfy some use cases.  We could publish our chain calculations so they can be verified, and then we have a trigger mechanism to release staked funds on error.

Also can peg to eth or some other chain with the root hash so we cannot roll back.
