Often instritutional processes will be poorly defined, and opaque.  This disconnects the processes from the intended beneficiaries.

We can model any external process as a workflow, and can treat anybody's interaction with it as a process execution.  We can learn from each execution and map out the process based on executions.  It is entirely possible to model a process based solely on executions, without knowing the process in advance.

Service to provide assistance to people - take a small cut and help guide people thru a process.  Eg: getting refunds from an airline, 

Ultimately we would hope the governers of the process use our system to model themselves and engage with their customers directly.

Ability to propose changes to the workflow using the modelling tools.
