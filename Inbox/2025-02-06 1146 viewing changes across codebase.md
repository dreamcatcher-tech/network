 I think we can make a UI element that allows us to click a button that will follow the cursor. So when multiple files across the project are being updated by the LLM, the UI will follow where the current cursor of generation is up to. And additionally, we should have a timeline button or a scrub button so you can scroll back and forwards and see the things that have changed. And so we would augment this or specialise this so that when text had not changed, the cursor would skip back to the previous change so you'd get a more rapid navigation where you'd be able to skip back by changes so you could sort of scroll back and forwards through all the changes that had been made and you could optionally have this showing visually with diffs or just as you scroll forwards and back the new file is above the cursor and the old file is below the cursor so you can roll using the mouse wheel back and forwards and it hides and reveals the lines of change just as you twiddle the mouse around which lets you kinda see it nicer. Plus it could be in my character diffs overlaid as well.
