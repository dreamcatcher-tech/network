Once we can set up a workbench where we can publish changed helps and stucks and share them amongst everyone, then we don't need any more plumbing.

Is it true that, inside this workbench, tendermint should be possible to make ?
We should be able to build the test suites with no more plumbing, where we are making the suites inside the NL workbench.




The toolkit consists of auto triggers, that cause actions to occur when some event happens, like a commit.  These hooks should run first, since they might reject the commit.
