If we made a decentralized wikipedia, then we could also rewrite the content, and allow a debate mechanism to allow multiple versions to persist.

The debate could occur between bots, and be a reasoned debate.

The reconciliation of knowledge bases applies here, and so that must tolerate divergence.

tests, or stucks can be posted that would settle the debate, and we await the solution, which requires energy.

If the only thing unique about a view is who said it,then its worthless.
