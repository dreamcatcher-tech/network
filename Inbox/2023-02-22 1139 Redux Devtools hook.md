Crisps act like a state atom in redux, so we could use the tools to show the crisp as dispatched to the application.

Offer parallel timelines that let us see the crisp as synced, and as finished.
Lets us simulate the app while loading.

Make the syncer have a dribble mode where it loads incrementally on purpose.  Can also be in step mode where it only moves to the next crisp when told.
