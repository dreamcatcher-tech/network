if the widgets run entirely in a frame that is totally controlled by us (same as with napps) then we can sign them.  this should be by default in the signing of the commits that published them.

So these widgets, altho untrusted, can be highly secured so that earnest actors will get an uncorruptible payload thru to the end users.
