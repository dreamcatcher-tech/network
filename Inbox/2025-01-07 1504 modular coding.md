break apart the functionality of files and relate them using interfaces.

then focus on a single file at a time.

The xml parsing should be separate from the server polling.
Then it can be focused on with no drift.

We really want to be able to just give it an interface, some checks, and then have it loop until it has met the requirements, or it has triggered an exception indicating that these requirements cannot be met.

Also be able to have multiple angles be undertaken, so the first prompt should ask for some architectural options, and then go forth and implement each one.

Asking for multiple architectural approaches seems best, since the first is not the best, sometimes.  Plus asking a certain way doesn't achieve the same thing, so you need to try randomizing the query, and then looking back to see if it matches - this gives good diversity.

We must be crucially careful of trying to build things that the next model will just blitz.

Need a way to keep notes with a project, and have the bot chat to us about getting those notes ratified, so we can talk about it more and build up a detailed spec, or some research topics that are required.
