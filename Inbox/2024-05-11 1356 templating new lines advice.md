Significant duplication of effort occurs when a new textiles order is raised.

The buyer needs a set format.
The wholesaler needs another format, and needs to add into their software.
Supplier needs yet another format.

Each delay in entry that requires a human to do somethnig is a chance to forget.
Ideally everything should be kept updated in realtime.

Make a system to take in emails, and templates, and keep them updated, plus auto fill in everything.
