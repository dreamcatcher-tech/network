Get the bots to run experiments with node modules, where they test their assumptions on the libraries, which serve as some integration tests.

They then generate their own docs on how the module works.

These generated versions of modules can be published too, so that bots can check them and can include their own tests.

Format should support large numbers of different tests that machines find easy by humans hard.

Then measure coverage of the module etc.
