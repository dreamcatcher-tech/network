If a series of urls was provided with a chain, it could be easier to find ?
Means it could be fetched using purely its chainId, but also by named urls, where it can treat them like trackers in a torrent.
Use a DHT to do a slower but more resilient lookup of the hosts or pieces of chain.

There could be like bootstrap peers.

Could be a large chain that gets hosted in sharded form, used as a directory.
