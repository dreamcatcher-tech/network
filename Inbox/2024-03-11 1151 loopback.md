Seems more natural in some aspects, since the filesystem changes would not need actively merging in, and the calls would be repeatable, so the fs could be updated by some accumulations, then the request would carry on with the update filesystem.

But, making fs updates explicity has clarity in that it would never be puzzling to a dev how the fs changed ?
