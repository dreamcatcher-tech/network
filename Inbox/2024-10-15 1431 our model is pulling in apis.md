If a company releases a javascript api for making calls, then we can wrap that up in a napp and put it on our platform.

Then everyones private data can be used where they wish to use this api.

So we provide a hub where any api can be used in any combination with a single billing arrangement, with secured private data.

That hub is transportable, so if you set up your own api endpoints, then you can run on your own hardware.

We would always seek to consume via api, since running the raw hardware is quite far out of scope.  Even if we did, it would be presented back as an API to the platform anyway, using the json io format.

JSON is the control message format, and files are the data format.
