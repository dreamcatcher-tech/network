if friends was really just agents, and you should show agents owned by you and not by you too.
repos represents the data structures that you are part of, but agents is about the personalities.  this is where you would show personas as well.O

have an agent store.

then show people in groups.

so I should be able to customize my install with different widgets that do different things.

i should be able to code up my own widget, have it pass a bunch of checks, pick from a collection of base starter projects, and publish.

widgets should have a 'fork me' button so you can work on them.
