We could just expose the service and that is our first offering.

Then we can offer napps hosting for function calls ?

Basically build it up like s3 with a range of services that are specifically targetted at LLM agents.

Artifact acts like the last filesystem, and we sell storage for this, but also you can run your own, and pool it all together, plus have a marketplace.
