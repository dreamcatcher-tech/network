we should be able to set up bots that can grind away looking for any kind of trading opportunities ?

these should be easily able to identify inefficiencies and then build up models to extract max from them.

later we can try and lure in other players ?

basically an analysis workbench that can seek out any kinds of trades, and can also watch macro cycles too, so it tries to model the consequences of different events, plus tries to run probabilities of things like weather.
