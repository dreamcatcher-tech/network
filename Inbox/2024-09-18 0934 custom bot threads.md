How can I Set up a bot so that I can have a talk exclusively with the o one model and stay on that model rather than having to use some keywords It's almost like I need a way to program what the starting prompt is, and then a button that opens a prompt in that mode and then be able to set that mode as the default

Like the config of the switchboard needs to be programmable, possibly behind different urls, or have a suite of buttons like a launch pad so I can click them in the stateboard and it immediately starts a chat how I want.
