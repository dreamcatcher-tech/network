Could make the AI step thru the code one AST function at a time, and then give opinions on how things were going.

It should highlight issues like referring to shared variables, and propose rewrites.

If the AI debugger stepped thru the code and analyzed each step, just going line by line thru the code the human supplied, maybe further insights or guarantees could be gained ?

It could attempt to generate the minimal set of tests that exercised the code completely.
