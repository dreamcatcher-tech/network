Use o1-pro to take the chats and squash them down.

This "rinsing" seems useful, if you take a project, and take all the fixes you applied, and then start again, you can get a better flop.

Previous messages seem to distort the flop too, so a single message that is reasoned well will have a better flop out than one that isn't.

So the goal is to keep working to make a really good flop at the start.  This can be a math spec of an algorithm, a detailed implementation plan.

Basically getting good single shot prompts seems to have a better chance of being nicely tweakable.

We should make the bot fight back if you ask for something contradictory.

The restart button should replay everything and do a rinse if you feel your chances are not being applied with low effort.
