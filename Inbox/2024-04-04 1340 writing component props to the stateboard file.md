Feed back to the AI when there is a parsing error.
We should be able to write the props for a react component in plain text, like an action button.

Being able to make gantt charts where the AI read in a bunch of splices, and asked for any new ones it needed, and then kept a mermaid gantt chart up to date with the splices - this would be less labour than anything we would make ourselves.

Mermaid tool that displays the last working render, and highlights when there is new writing happening on the underlying file, and shows errors if the transients has ended but there are still errors.  Could have a merge guard that would not allow the merge to succeed if it was not valid markdown.

Make a format checking library, where we can guarantee that some outputs meet a certain format.

Make buttons pop up inside the markdown as soon as the text is interpreted as valid.
Hightlight when showing an out of data one and that more writing is currently happening.
