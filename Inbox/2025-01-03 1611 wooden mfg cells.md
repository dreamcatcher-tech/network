Using robot processes, we can map wood grain and do very efficient cuts and robotic sanding.

So we can make furniture that fits the grain of the wood, and the exact dimensions of the customer, and can accomodate their own changes and designs, and all made locally.

Do bending and steaming on the wood too.

Make super low cost, quick turn around, custom designs.

You can see vr versions in the space it will be in.

ansys style FEA modelling assures the strength of the items.

Parts are very replaceable.

The cells are configurable to anything at all, so can produce all kinds of parts.

People can make their designs and sell them.

People can improve the cells and earn royalty from them.
