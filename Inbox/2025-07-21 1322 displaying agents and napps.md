When we display a napp that has assistant capabilities or bot capabilities (AI capabilities that are exposed), we should show it as a picture of different modes that it can take input in (like vision, text, and some flags about its intelligence capabilities: what model or models it will use, if it will use workflows or multi-step, if it can use knowledge bases, if it can do reasoning, voice, and other things).
