If a bunch of tools were made that helped projects reach consumers, and took a royalty slice back, this removes a self choking step that independence introduces.  Because the founders of each tool need revenue, they have to charge funds, which reduces their usage.

If the founders charged only royalties, calculated by the dreamcatcher, then trees of attribution could result, where the money flows deeply thru the tree, encouraging more to do the same.

It presents the tooling that made the product as part of the product itself, that gets paid for upon each purchase.

The tooling gets better, the products get better, the money flows stronger.
