Would be modular so it has tooling that was highly configurable.  Even the config is LLM guided.

New tools and improved tools can be inserted in the system easily.

The bots can suggest which tools might work for you.

The bots know how to use the workplace, and they can redo some tasks you tried to do using a different version / config of the workbench to show you wants of working better.

Can include all kinds of widgets, like cad modelling and 3D printing.

So it starts to look like  PC, since PCs can be used for everything, and so too should this platform.  Generative CAD/CAM, robotics, knowledge, coding, browsing, personal development.
