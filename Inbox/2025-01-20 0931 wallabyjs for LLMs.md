**Concept**  

A real-time testing and debugging environment for LLM-generated code, inspired by Wallaby.js but tailored to LLMs. The system reruns code on every file change, collects coverage, and provides instant feedback and console logs. Breakpoints are easily set and stepped through by rerunning from the start. LLMs can interpret coverage data annotated in-line, guiding them to refine tests or redesign code for better testability.

**Key Ideas**

- **Breakpoint & Logging Integration**: LLMs can insert breakpoints and log points; logs are captured in a special library optimized for LLM parsing.
- **Time Travel Debugging**: Full re-execution replaces complex state snapshots, enabling step-back functionality without heavy overhead.
- **Coverage Annotation**: Each code line or gutter displays real-time coverage, pushing LLMs to enhance test coverage.
- **Continuous Feedback Loop**: On any file change, all tests rerun automatically, and the LLM receives immediate pass/fail and performance data.
- **Extensibility**: Could integrate with container-based sandboxes, letting LLMs manipulate environment variables or system configurations mid-debug without interfering with the host.

**Additional Thoughts**

- **Predictive Error Analysis**: Implement a feature where the system automatically flags potential hotspots or untested paths before LLM code generation.
- **Interactive Rewrites**: Pair coverage with direct code navigation, letting the LLM jump to untested lines, propose changes, and see updated coverage in near real time.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Run parallel instrumented tests to handle large-scale projects efficiently, ensuring minimal wait times for the LLMâ€™s feedback loop.
