If we have webhooks on the Git repos, and when the update occurs, we would run the build making use of a cached build. We may hold a working directory that is a single object treated like a cached object. Then the build is served to a headless browser. The headless browser loads it, errors are reported, errors are attempted to be repaired with the smallest number of clicks, and an agent drives the browser and checks it for business rules, best practices, style, and accessibility. 

these problems surface ready to be fed back in to codex.
