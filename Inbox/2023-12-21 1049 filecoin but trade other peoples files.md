Instead of tokens, we could make it be direct barter where you trade having other peoples files.  The closer your relationship with these people, the less likely you are to be held to ransom.  Have people you trust, and trade with them for funds or friendship so that your file distribution is amongst your social network, not strangers.

Means you can get higher recoverability for cheaper.  Can open up deals like group purchase of a hard drive in exchange for some kind of uptime, so the hoster puts up an escrow and the chain makes sure they stick to their agreement.

Ideally you should hold your own files, at least on an external drive or something, but you just want the knowledge that in a disaster, you can recover.
