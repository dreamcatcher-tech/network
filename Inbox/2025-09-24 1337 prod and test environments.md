having a separate prod network means we can deploy and leave it stable while we work on shaky features.

We can have several lines of development, where some are allowing public apps, and others are just our general platform.

we could present the main router under multiple domain names ?
or have a different one, per domain name, which handles auth and billing differently, but they are technically the same thing ?
