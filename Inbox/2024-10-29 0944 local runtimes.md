For dev, or any other reason, you should be able to easily set up a server that will provide runtimes for any package type.

This should be the same code that runs on the lambda functions or the cloud platform.

Basically pull in runtimes for all the supported environments.

So you can code in any language you like, and then the whole napps registry is available to you via this multiple runtime server piece.

It can run hot, so it stays loaded, so all your requests are all near instant, since the runtimes are always available.

So really any server you make should be this firecracker compatible system, that plugs into the shared compute pool, and may offer its operations to the public.

Can allow anyone to run this if they have secure enclave computing.

Else we have stake based guarantees for the correctness of the computing.

If you put up a large stake, you can be used as single shot computing.

Clients should be redundancy aware, so they can take a speculative result and move on, with some way to yank back if it is discovered to fail consensus.

Connect firecracker controls up to a chain, so you can control it using the cloud plane that we supply.  So you can attach all your computing servers and devices up and manage them here.

Lets you set your server to prioritize your workload but be available to others during idle time, earning money for you.
