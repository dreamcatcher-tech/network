If we can show that we can AI code apps that do what they want quicker than their existing systems, and where deployment may involve implementing a few apps to prove a point, then we can get them talking.

If we can mimick their existing functionality and do so very quickly, then they should see that this platform will rapidly overtake whatever they have.

We will probably win heavily on price, too.

But the biggest area we win on is freedom / sovereignty - a wide market of apps that can be developed, and allow internal innovation to occur with very little friction.
