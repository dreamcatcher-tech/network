Be able to receive a voip stream by selecting a strong node to receive the stream.

Ideally we would receive multiple streams in parallel, to ensure redundancy, but starting small we can use existing voip providers.

Means we can process the calls in realtime to then be able to present helpful information on screen.  Gives us caller ID which lets us pull up the account instantly.  Before a human answers we can show the account name and number already, along with any relevant information, like why they are probably calling.

Voicemails get processed direct thru whisper in realtime, then responses are prepared.  Emails drafted based on the customer account.

Means that people on their phones can take calls anywhere, so long as they have good net connection.
