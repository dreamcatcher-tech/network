virtualized decentralized mcp server calls

The protocol need not be done to a single server, but if each host was an mcp server, then each repo was an mcp too.
mcp is an execution context.
the server represents a context boundary, and a session is a stateful interaction with this context bound.

hotpotato as the agent gateway.

nesting mcp servers means that we can treat lobechat as tho we are IN a top level mcp server, and then we are calling out.

The trick is that the mcp servers can call each other as peers with the exact same functions.

So if we make a tool that converts napp schemas to mcp function calls ?
Then we can integrate with lobechat, but also can wrap our server in a standard protocol.

Think we can map napps exactly to mcp servers.

mcp compat is good since we can jack in to a great many systems, which can help people sample us and play around without making a full jump.  Doesn't cost us anything, since we certainly don't lose anything.

mcp can also be used to handle searching and other arbitrarily complex inter agent work, and then provide  a way for the UI to browse the progress, since we can return an id.
