If we can make a gui of the Dreamcatcher so that each project shows up on it, then we can have some basis for continuing - basically the goal is to build out that homepage more.

Show how to let people fork it and run their own gui whilst remaining compatible with all others.

Pull in .git repos, and wrap github URLs.

The GUI should come with the project in its entirety.  Includes issues, discussions, CI results.
Syncing the full repo should not be needed, as you may only want the code.

Make a CI pipeline that can auto run using shared compute resources with incentives and repercussions.
