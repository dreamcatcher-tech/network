Make a simple device on a post that acts as:
1. Network mesh node
2. sound monitor
3. camera sensors
4. RF monitor
5. boundary peg
6. seismic sensor
7. intruder detection with other nodes
8. night light - ptz the light, RGB colors too
9. emergency alerts - just shout loudly near it and someone will come
10. weather sensor for wind and rain monitoring
11. loudspeaker system
12. proof of location system
13. ptz laser pointer to highlight / guide directions
14. laser scanner to paint roadlines at night, and property boundaries
15. compute node to help the mesh, with AI boost
16. storage to help store data for the island

Has little solar panels to charge it up.
Easily rapidly strongly mount using a pole that acts as its own drill bit tailored for the SI dirt - bolt it down deep.
Strap to trees too.
Fold down small to transport or protect during storms.

Should be cheap, modular, open design.

Be able to say "ok island" and a chat to get some info.
Can project the metaverse out, so that metaverse members can almost be there, or you can at least get a sense when they are around, since the lamps light up a different color.
