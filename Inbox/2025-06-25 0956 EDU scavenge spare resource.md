some maths, like if the ratio of teachers in 5 : 1, then if we had 2 parents, we could handle 10 kids, minus their own.

We should be able to trade time between parents, and have an ai do admonishments for failing to comply with the deal.

People can use the AI to help them plan to get around their shortcomings.
