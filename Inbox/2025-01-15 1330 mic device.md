Make a voice mask that can do voice changing, and then connects via bluetooth to the phone, which then connects to the deno deployment thing.

Or, give it data access or a sim card / esim, and let it be a sound source on the internet.   Just has a single light when it has connection, and a different color when it is recording, and another for when it is uploading.

If you bluetooth pair it, then it can use your phones data to get to the internet.

It can be used by your phone as a sound source using our app protocol, since the protocol shoudl be able to stream to lan or local sources, so not an actual mic connection, but a webrtc one.

But it might be also be able to be a mic to be used in any app on your phone.

App to change the voice processing that gets done on the device.
