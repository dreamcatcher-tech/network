If we had a schema based layout to avoid repeating json keys, then we could put the entire db of customers into a single call to gpt-5-nano.  This would give great lookup flexibility, as the user typed, and then we can get further savings on cached hits.

Makes it a cent or two per call.

Can be cheaper than the code it takes to implement rapid search and sync.

Makes it easier to find customers in bulk too, like counting customers with certain properties, spotting missing / messy data.

Could also break down into small chunks and send to nano to get more reliable outputs.
