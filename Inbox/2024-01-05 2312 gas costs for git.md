Deleting files should free up some gas.
Changes should be measured in terms of how much you changed the git structure.
Compute is charged by the ram-ms per core of utilization, normalized to give providers some slack so they don't have to supply uncontended cpu, but they could if you paid a premium for it.

Merges can be charged by the git object.
