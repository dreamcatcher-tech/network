A single chain can act as a proxy to other paid api services.  Also act as a cache.

This can be useful internal to your application, but also to allow devs to share credentials and manage billing in a better way.  Lets them take advantage of larger pricing breaks in bulk, and caching between calls.

Allows for competitors to be set up with api compatibility and example data.
