If we need to content with multiple shell chains between tabs, then we should also be able to handle this between users.

We could allow for all the user chains to be uploaded to the app, as well, so that any user can see any other users chains.  This should be placed on level higher, so that changes in these chains do not cause refreshes to occur.
