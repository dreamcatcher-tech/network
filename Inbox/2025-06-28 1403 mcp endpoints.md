generate an api key server side, and then the mcp server makes use of this key, which is present for the length of the task.  It timesout and needs regen / revalidating.
It can be stored with the job, so incoming requests check against the job, and the key.
so the job must be active and the key valid.

or we can generate keys that are long lived, so people can connect chatgpt or other systems up using mcp.
