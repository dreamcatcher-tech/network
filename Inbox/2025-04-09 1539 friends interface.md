on the network, allow a public interface to make a social page, and let people add you as a friend.

Make a system for anointing so that some people are in a circle (out of circle) or just acquaintances. If you vouch for someone and this person behaves badly, you will suffer a reputation loss. If they behave well, you will gain reputation. Be careful who you trust. 

Since we are decentralizing the trust aspect of the network, we can use these networks for deciding what is true, what is correct, when a legitimate event has occurred, what is fake news, how to resolve service names, who to share data with, what privileges people (even distant connections) are allowed to have. 

This is very useful in filesharing networks, where people introduce friends to the filesharing pool, and can relay files between each other, where the encryption is altered, or is always one off.

Then if something bad happens, these same algorithms hone in on who was to blame.  We also inject data alterations so we can steganographically stamp things.  Need a clever way to do this while at the same time deduplicating the storage costs.

Maybe a proxy storage service, where a trusted party holds a base item, which is still encrypted, but then it streams down versions that are encrypted differently as a way of fingerprinting.  So original sharer creates an encrypted version, then when it shares, an new encryption version is streamed.

This might make use of zkproofs or shamir sharing or something to make it less obvious who the original sharer was.

The defense is that when a conviction for a file is presented, surely they must have to present the encrypted data too, which can be used to fingerprint and identify.

The stakes for war are exactly the same as for torrenting - higher stakes, exact same mechanics.
