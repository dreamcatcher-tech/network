on the network, allow a public interface to make a social page, and let people add you as a friend.

Make a system for anointing so that some people are in a circle (out of circle) or just acquaintances. If you vouch for someone and this person behaves badly, you will suffer a reputation loss. If they behave well, you will gain reputation. Be careful who you trust. 

Since we are decentralizing the trust aspect of the network, we can use these networks for deciding what is true, what is correct, when a legitimate event has occurred, what is fake news, how to resolve service names, who to share data with, what privileges people (even distant connections) are allowed to have.
