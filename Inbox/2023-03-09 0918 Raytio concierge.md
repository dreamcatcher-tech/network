Provide software to the conventional companies to be able to engage digitally with their customers - sell them software and services to digitize, then resell the software elsewhere.

## Background
In general, the number of services people use is increasing.  Those services are constantly trying to touch their customers less since this is costly.  We should provide a router type service in the network, so that people deal with just one person, and that person is an expert at managing all their other things.
