If we set up an AI to trawl everything it sees for things that look like us, or for any given topic, then we can have extreme visibility of novel topics, and can learn new relevant information quickly.

So if we were looking for other dreamcatchers, we should set up a watchtower to track all these items, and then also reach out automatically to anyone that looks similar.
