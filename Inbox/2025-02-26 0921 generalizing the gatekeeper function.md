If the dreamcatcher agent was only about attribution quality, then we need another agent to maintain and manage the upgrades of artifact.  This means that possibly the upgrade agent can be generalized, and can be put in charge of upgrading itself.

The only decision is to accept or deny a PR, and to provide reasoning.  It is simply a better or worse comparison.  It can consider differently the stability of the system, then the performance, then the pricing.  These simple goals are standard as properties for all software systems.

The artifact maintainer would be charged with deciding between better or worse.


The currency maintainer ?  Set a version of a currency, then do upgrades on it.

Just goal it simply ? it doesn't need any special treatment from the other agents, as they keep doing their own thing.  The kidney cares not for the brains thoughts.

Can have some specialized modes, like checks the coverage for the code, checks the logic behind the patches, checks the benchmarks, checks the runcost.  Checks backwards compatibility.  Sets the semver.  Runs against prior real world usage.

Running against a sampling of the previous computations is useful.

Some kind of reputation, so we can avoid checking submissions - could be simply paying a fee to submit.
