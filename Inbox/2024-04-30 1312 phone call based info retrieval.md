If we could handle phone calls thru the app, then we could parse the info and try add helpful info on screen.

Detect the customer record based on the phone number of the incoming call.

Pull up all calendar events related to this person, if a client and you're going away in the next few months, be sure to nudge that up.

If we had the audio stream from the browser all the time anyway, for voice, then which call they're on shouldn't matter.
