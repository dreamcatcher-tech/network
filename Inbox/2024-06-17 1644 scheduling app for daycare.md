multiple parties being able to coordinate in an AI assisted chat.

AI is goaled with ensuring that coverage is met for a given child, and it attempts to solve for gaps using the market available to it.

Services marketplace where mutliple nannys can offer services.  Can be long or short term and can be very bursty.  AI processes unique requests from families and Nanny's can ask questions using AI.

Of each party the AI can ask all the awkward questions so that no individual has to.  This makes everyone comfortable since the ugliness is out of the way.  Payment is always by way of escrow.  Insurance is always paid for.  You can bid for other peoples slots if they are open to it, where both nanny and family get extra funds if the need is high enough.

Infection of service is that the nannys use it to coordinate and bill, then they use it for picking up extra shifts.  Families use it to get sick care in a hurry or spot childcare.

Friends and family can be on the app too, so they can offer services for kudos, but the app helps track this too, and makes it easy to jump out and pull in other services.

Can manage things like cycling nannys around so there is good diversity and backup.

Manages contacts of everyone and permits direct calls.

Cover an education program too, so it isn't simply minding, but rather development as well.  Full health records of the child is covered.

Meal prep and delivery can be included.  Possibly using other peoples homes, where one large meal is cooked and then distributed out.
