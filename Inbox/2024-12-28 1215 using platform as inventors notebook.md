make full context questions that can go into o1, with context costing showing, where token count and cost of the inference under different models and settings can be shown.

If we can make a system that can reliably operate on the git repo of the notebook I am currently using, then this will be an incredible boost in productivity.

If it can work on any repo automatically, this is a great tool.

Ideally I could be reading some article or some output, and I could be making side notes as I go, that are being turned into their own threads, and then I can at the end deal with a summarization, or flick over to these ones.  

This would possibly be a widget that had a chat notation side bar, and if it was selected could quickly switch out which chat was showing, but keep the stateboard the same.
