What we should be able to do is be having a conversation with each other and then when the conversation triggers someone to either have another thought or need to do some thinking for themselves they can indicate that they have stopped listening which would say that their buffer is full in which case the speaker can choose to continue because they may be on a roll and they really want to get out all the sayings so that it's recorded in their notes and able to be processed. The person who is no longer listening can also be speaking and they can be speaking in a way that is to the respondent or just to the AI in which case the speaker can choose to splice in their audio so start listening in again or finish what they were thinking and then catch up by skim reading what the live transcription is the idea is that we are now trying to work in a way that we humans are talking to each other but we also relying on the input of these highly intelligent AI systems so we want a set of rules and tools that can merge those types of conversations highly effectively. It would sort of become more like a multi-party meeting instead of just a two by two human meeting because sometimes we'd want to talk to our AIs or have a think about things and we should be able to indicate that with system status rather than in band with voice where the voice channel is primarily what we're using to communicate out our thoughts this also harnesses the fact that we can use the visual channels to pull in multiple other channels, summaries, and other such things because we can read far faster than we can listen as well we can read by looking at multiple different sources as opposed to hearing just one at a time.

We can also:

1. Bump up in priority what a bot or someone else has said
2. Indicate emphatic agreement or support
3. Flag items by loosely highlighting or gesturing at the area

We can then talk about those things. This starts to get really fun when you've got more than one person communicating and it may be that it happens kind of informally - I'm just working, and this is how I work. Then if my friend happens to be online at the same time he can listen in or jump in or whatever. I don't have to take on board what he's saying, but he can often help me more, and then we can have arbitrarily many people join, come and go. The meetings can be replayed so that you can re-listen and see if you missed a thought.
