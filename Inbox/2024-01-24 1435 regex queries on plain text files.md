If we made a function that could do queries on batches of text files by the AI writing out a regex and some conditions, then we just run it over all the files and do something with it.

AI could build up pipelines, like map reduce type thing, where it says what params are and then starts the pipeline running.

Pass how to send an email by using a function that uses a regex to pull out the email address, and then sends the email.

Before doing a bulk email, it will confirm with the user the changes it wants to merge back in to master, and you can agree or not.

You could sit on the main session thread and ask questions about the changes that are being proposed to merge in, then you could finally admit the changes in.
