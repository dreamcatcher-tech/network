There is a lot of prompting that goes on to get the definitions out.  Is there much value in recording all the inputs that went to making those ?

Is there any point in recording them, keeping original audio, or any other such thing ?

Original audio provides an interesting signature about how a thing occured.

In the future, an illumination of a deduction of how anything at all happened in the past.
