Almost need a language or a framework that requires everything to be communicated by interfaces, and contains some background context for each file.

Each file needs a purpose, and an interface - it needs some reasoning, some invariants.

So any modifications should be done first to the interface, then the spec, then the tests, then lastly the code.

Tests might not be needed if the math spec is checked ?

The tests should be auto run by the platform and the results fed back in to the AI.

The reason why we need a platform for platforms is that our strategy around how best to code with AI keeps changing, and so it will change as often as the models, and many other people will come up with ideas for this too.

But what about the end of code, where simple english rules are what gets used to specify the system ?
