We could make a Lucid Icon widget. But the difference is I can have a chat with this widget or with the napp behind it. Where it will attempt to narrow down or select a range of icons that sound broadly like what I want. It would also rank them by how far-reaching or alternate ways to think about it. This should be very creative. This would be more like a chatbot than an agent. It would have chat capability but it would not have agency or independence.
