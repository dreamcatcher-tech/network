If we took in payment using crypto, and used a crypto onramp to purchase usdc or something stable, then we do not need stripe integration.  We could still take stripe payments to purchase platform credits, but these could only be used for hosting services.

Then when we make payments for profit share or escrow release, we can pay straight to their crypto accounts.

We can take in invoice amounts using wise.

The purpose of offering securities was to develop a system of being able to develop non securities so we have ambient attribution.  So if we can make it across the gap of developing enough software infrastructure and enough legal defense that what we are offering is not a security, then we can start trading directly, rather than needing a crowdfund.

If we went properly decentralized, then payments in and out do not need fiat.  They would be in crypto and the tasks would be genuine nfts.

So the hosters would be legal entities, and the anon entity just pays the hosters in platform currency, those hosters then pay in fiat to keep services running.

The price of platform coin goes up over time, based on usage, so new users are paying earlier users.

But, without stock, we cannot get some gains for our efforts, altho we would have NFTs that could be sold and would reflect similar types of gains.  We could list a pubco afterwards, as a peer, which expends effort into the network, but this would not need to be the first action.

So the buildside would be entirely crypto based, but the buy side would be purchasing from a hoster directly.  Prohibit stripe payers from receiving any profit share, as this is problematic with credit card clearance.

If we can get the problem to a head, it would basically say that the overhead of having small scale equity agreements blocks a whole class of innovation from happening.

If we could get some set level of scale, of say 5 independent operators, then we could claim decentralized, and if this is how the future returns come, then it couldn't be a security - if we can get this level of automated equity distribution, then we are off - we would be the only system able to operate in that space, since it is a void where the admin is too high for any conventional company to enter, but we entered due to automation and decentralization.

We would be targetting the $0 to $15,000 mark of project size.  This is maybe the biggest group of innovation, and yet unserved by equity style collaboration.

All this leakage is like gas leaks in a piston engine - yes it works, but the gains of zero loss are immense compared to even a little bit of loss.

Is it protecting the consumers if these types of things are supressed from existing ?

So either you participate, or the efforts of others are decentralized and disinterested in you individually, which protects you from scams.

In the first instance, you are receiving a completed thing, when it is unconstructed.  Secondly, once constructed, whatever revenues you receive is not the result of any particular person.  So we could make this thing tradeable if the unit was being used by disconnected parties.  This is when it is decentralized and generally useful.  Participation is required to be directly useful, but indirect, which includes revenue from Dreamcatcher, needs to be sufficiently decentralized that nobody can be relying on a single individual for those gains - at that point it can be traded publicly.

During the killzone, we will need to treat carefully and build up legal expertise and cash reserves to defend this view.  We can raise a traditional company to support this view.

When decentralized, we can issue a currency that represents aggregate value, which is used to store and pay the attributions.  It slowly inflates based on usage.

We would actively alert the SEC when individuals are promoting our token by parsing using AI.

We could stop participating as a show that the thing works fine in our absence.

we would have the whole network be in this participation mode only, then we would allow some items to be classes as decentralized.  Then we would ultimately strive for the core network to be decentralized too.  Along the way, we would raise a traditional security to fuel the network, not to build it, where the design goals fluctuate a lot.  But once the goals are set, and the network is stable, we list publicly and use that to boost the network on its way to decentralization, thru intelligent dispersal of capital.
