If we took in payment using crypto, and used a crypto onramp to purchase usdc or something stable, then we do not need stripe integration.

Then when we make payments, we can pay straight to their accounts.

We can take in invoice amounts using wise.

The purpose of offering securities was to develop a system of being able to develop non securities so we have ambient attribution.  So if we can make it across the gap of developing enough software infrastructure and enough legal defense that what we are offering is not a security, then we can start trading directly, rather than needing a crowdfund.

If we went properly decentralized, then payments in and out do not need fiat.  They would be in crypto and the tasks would be genuine nfts.

So the hosters would be legal entities, and the anon entity just pays the hosters in platform currency, those hosters then pay in fiat to keep services running.

The price of platform coin goes up over time, based on usage, so new users are paying earlier users.

But, without stock, we cannot get some gains for our efforts, altho we would have NFTs that could be sold.
