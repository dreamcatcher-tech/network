If we took in payment using crypto, and used a crypto onramp to purchase usdc or something stable, then we do not need stripe integration.  We could still take stripe payments to purchase platform credits, but these could only be used for hosting services.

Then when we make payments for profit share or escrow release, we can pay straight to their crypto accounts.

We can take in invoice amounts using wise.

The purpose of offering securities was to develop a system of being able to develop non securities so we have ambient attribution.  So if we can make it across the gap of developing enough software infrastructure and enough legal defense that what we are offering is not a security, then we can start trading directly, rather than needing a crowdfund.

If we went properly decentralized, then payments in and out do not need fiat.  They would be in crypto and the tasks would be genuine nfts.

So the hosters would be legal entities, and the anon entity just pays the hosters in platform currency, those hosters then pay in fiat to keep services running.

The price of platform coin goes up over time, based on usage, so new users are paying earlier users.

But, without stock, we cannot get some gains for our efforts, altho we would have NFTs that could be sold and would reflect similar types of gains.  We could list a pubco afterwards, as a peer, which expends effort into the network, but this would not need to be the first action.

So the buildside would be entirely crypto based, but the buy side would be purchasing from a hoster directly.  Prohibit stripe payers from receiving any profit share, as this is problematic with credit card clearance.
