How can we evaluate performance when change are made to the prompts ?
Can a session have a bot which then has its own sessions, before being published ?
What do the test versions look like ?
How can be get automated self improvment to occur ?
Backchat should always be ready to switch back to something and discard anything that occured provided no side effects occured.  This means each prompt need not worry about context switch or backchat.
### publishing a new DAO proposal
These should be the proposal to change the files in the repo of a particular DAO, which can include ledger payment schedules, or anything really.  By changing the files, we enable proposing to change anything.  Then certain types of proposal can be channelled to represent something, like a payment plan, or a governance change.

### publishing a new version of HAL
needs to be played with in a session first, then pushed up to the higher level so all new sessions for that person use it, then ultimately up so that all new sessions on the platform us it.

### publishing a docubot that is intended to gather more info
like all the different mechanisms by which DAO voting could be constructed.
