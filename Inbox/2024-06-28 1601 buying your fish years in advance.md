Instead of making provenance of food decorated atop the current boomer system, we should let you purchase your fish years in advance, watch it grow.

The NFTs increase in specificity, plus you can trade them, for cash, or other NFTs.

Basically you want to buy a fish 2 years ahead of time, you should still get a fish at the end of it, but we use pooling to ensure that you didn't get a specific fish until right at the end.

You purchase into a pool of fish with a guaranteed yield rate, and some price insurance on top of that.  You are guaranteed a fish from that pool.

As the pool progresses, you can narrow down your particular fish.

So by providing a funding vehicle for the providers, we have the provenance as a side effect.

If you are intelligent you shoudl be able to influence the value of your money, so by purchasing at a particular place, you can get high yields in salmon, and you can pay money to have things put in place, like plant equipment, etc.  Makes you a very active investor.

You can swap it for a salmon at a later stage at any point.

Even if you didn't eat it, you can still hold the NFT if the recipient didn't want it ?

Salmon takes about 2 - 3 years to grow.

Basically let the consumers participate at any point in the provenance, rather than just the end, and use it as a fundraising mechanism, since it is like crowdsourcing / kickstarter for farming.  Purchase a product ahead of time, possibly get delivery of it, see the provenance along the way, know that it is a sustainably and ethically sourced product, learn about the whole process, and contribute to improving that process.

If we set up a service that provided loan facilities to farmers based on crowdsales of future products ?
Could also sell the actual capital equipment, like milking machines, and then pay the owners of the tokenized equipment royalties.
