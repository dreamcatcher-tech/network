Need some way to let smax work on a separate branch, so it is like the working version is used to write tests and make changes in a separate branch.  The running of the tests occurs separate from this branch, and then when he is happen with it, a squash merge is made back up.

This might be a separate repo that he makes of the HAL repo, so he controls it and can do anything he likes in there.
