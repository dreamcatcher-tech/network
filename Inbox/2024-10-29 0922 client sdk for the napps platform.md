Each platform needs its own sdk to be able to integrate with their own code.

They need this to be able to build their code, as well as test and integrate with other language packages.

Need tools that do publishing for each platform, and also push to the napps metaregistry.

The napp registry builds the shims required to make your tools available, tests them, and starts hosting them, so people can play with them online.
