If we do not inflate the token value beyond what is liquid and sitting in its bank account, but instead carve of part of the attribution as interest that is due to everyone who is holding the coin, then we can ensure that people who have this coin keep growing rather than deflating.

If they hold it rather than withdrawing their USD after running the attribution algo, then what benefit did they provide to anyone ?  Their coins could be automatically used to stake the network ?  So that all currency is inherently staked, since all currency is at risk from a consensus breach.

The coins are at risk, and so need returns.  There is also a risk between the stable assets, in that they might collapse for some reason, or crash in value.  The coin acts as a bridge of this, that is backed by computation demand, and averages out across all the currencies used to purchase it.

We could allow each tx to be paid for partially by some of the coin that was baselessly issued, which encapsulated the power of the chain to meet its payouts over time.
