we can use this to watch for when repos change, if we share the read only view.

so even stats on the overall system can be triggered using nfs watches on files, which seemsm uch simpler than making our own custom watchers.

so fiber watching, output status - everything could be read from the nfs server, and by walking and navigating this server.
plus using tools like fzf to search it rapidly.
