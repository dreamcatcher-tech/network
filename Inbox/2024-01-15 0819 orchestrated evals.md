When the commissioners example conversations are given, they simulate the response of the bot.
We should make a bot that tries to follow the conversation flow as best it can, given than the response is already different.  So it is given the script, and then it attempts to stay the course, and then will error if it is not possible, and gives a short reason why.

These reasons should standardize eventually.

If it was able to hold a suitably similar conversation, it scores the SUT response against adherance to the example given.
