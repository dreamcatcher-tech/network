So using a web interface to chat about these things.

We could use the direct filesystem for now, and just read straight from files, then output the results directly ?

Avoids all the complicated git stuff.

A cloud version would mean we have auto merging, and you can ask questions about the merge directly.

we should have the next customer release showing, as the task that they are going to receive next.  Also their top level task they will receive.  So the top level tasks are things we are trying to hit whilst steering thru the short term goals.  The reasons why we chose them also matter.

why is a stuck not just called a task ?

Make the napp interface with just an fs api, then we do not need to have a full blown git api ?

The git functions like branch, history, etc - these can be added later, as the current filesystem doesn't worry about any of that.
