Buyers paying for usage means that contributors and funders are the suppliers here, and the revenue is split between them.

Several modes
- payment for credits that get consumed by us and the api gateway.
- payment as escrow for services to be delivered, as a funder
- payment as purchasing the use of software, which is then dispersed back to funders and contributors

Payouts can be done in cryptocurrency from stripe.

Might need multiple companies that can act as payment processors for us.

Use stripes id services to kyc the customers.

Could we sell equity in one of these companies ?

Ideally we have a company that holds our NFTs, then list that.

The gateway company is run by us as a not for profit, and merely facilitates commerce.  We want this piece to be able to be done by anyone, and be able to trade between these entities.
