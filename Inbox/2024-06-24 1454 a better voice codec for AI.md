When transmitting human voice, all our codecs were designed for human ears.  We should make a codec that is better for AI.

Could include a local text transcription.
Could include enough of the sounds its hearing to let the AI guess at the next word based on context.

Should be reconstructing the voice using voice cloning and very scant packets about the voice so it sounds realistic.
