Be able to do some tests where we cause the moneyworks server to fault and make sure it still proceeds. We cause the network connection to the artifact service to fault, and it should still work.

I think the test would simply boot up, try pull for moneyworks, try push to the artifacts server, verify what's up there, start a watcher, detect when files have altered within artifact, trigger appropriately when edits occur, do some edits of some specific customer records.
