Inside the .git folder, we could store extra files, like something to hold the pooled items, the maintenance lock, and the side effect lock.

Side effect lock would need to be held on a per PID basis.

Side effect lock could be a .lock file in the PID path.

Can also trace the transmission commit, so we can batch our atomic transmissions separately from the main head, in cases where we are over the atomic mutations limit.

If the repo doesn't have a ref file, then the PID doesn't exit or the repo doesn't exist either.

So pooling should check that the PID head exists and is not null.
This can also cover pooling to branches that have been deleted and can result in an immediate error.
