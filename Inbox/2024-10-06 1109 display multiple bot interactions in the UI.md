I think that we can allow one bot to call another bot where one bot simply mimics the user's query and then we can show the response come back as though we had indeed called this other agent and we show the agent's response as the current response and indicate that one bot is processing it so the result is not final and what this means is that we can give the user some instant response plus they could always see the undocked response and then one bot does a presentation or correctness or semantic pass over the top where it may choose to send another query back and so we're presenting to the user a collapsed list of discussion that's gone back and forth already with the last message being visible but we are indicating to the user that further processing is occurring in there this response they could jump in interrupt it and start doing something different or they could just wait
