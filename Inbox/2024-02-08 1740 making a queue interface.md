But isn't this just the same as the isolate interface with parameters ?

Is artifact just an isolate, using the exact same tooling ?

The only difference is how it pushes itself into the queue.

? does it need PID info ?

Not inside, but as a branch - so the data isn't happening inside a given chain, but instead is happening as a child chain - the data stays flat and unaffected, but its PID relationship is what matters, and what can set different isolation and side effect access.  The parent sets how to access these resources.

It can derive fs layers from its own one, and it doesn't care how those layers got there.

So the actions would be from the API that artifact would give us, which means the whole deployment could be presented internally like just another chain ?  The isolate, instead of being code, is a remote system.
