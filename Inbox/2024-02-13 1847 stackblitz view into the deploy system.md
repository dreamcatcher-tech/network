If we could provide an ide that instantly popped up and showed all the files inside the deploy git fs, and a web interface to interact via chat, this is the ultimate in power to deliver to devs.

They get their old tools so they can processed text and analyze git commits, plus the new tools, and they can do session analysis on how other people have used their bots.

Then we can add some tooling of our own, for gathering repro cases from branches.

Then we can offer massively parallel computation as tests are changed, so the browser need only carry a small load, and then this insane beast of a machine handles everything else for you.

Plus we can allow shared editing where other people can see the same filesystem, and can edit in realtime with you.
