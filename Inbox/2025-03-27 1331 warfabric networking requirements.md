a direct connection to the front line has some interesting networking properties. 

there is the extremely low latency drone control systems. This is equivalent to VoIP. All the devices on the field should attempt to mesh and provide these urgent communication channels. 

Next comes the Resilient Backhaul which allows data to accumulate and be relayed between devices so that whilst there may not be a live connection all the way to the battlefield the data will eventually make it back. This is used for: sensor data logs backup execution history 

The devices at the edge can be confidential devices. These networks can be not necessarily open, but the security of them can be cheapened. The servers that process this data can be worldwide and confidential. 

The goal is really to be able to connect the Innovation Network directly to the front line as quickly and as fully as possible.
