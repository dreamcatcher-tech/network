Because everything is in plain text format, if something goes horribly wrong, we will always have a copy of the db AND we will have ample tools to navigate it and fix it.
Making each process be a branch means we can narrow down complex trees of process invocation and recreate any given piece of the process.

We can then snip things in the past and then regenerate all that came afterwards, then force push that, or we can commit the different to patch it later.

We can run machine scrubs on the git system, but we can also run AI checks on the data periodically, as well as checking all the changed data for consistency and health.

GPT4 could be tasked with looking for any anomylies, and we would need to ok major changes with a reason and some authority in the commit log.

It is never susceptible to cryptolocker problems, since we always have the data at its last known good state.
