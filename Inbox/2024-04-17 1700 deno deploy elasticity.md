We will always be beholden to the shape of deno deploy elasticity.

How can this be mapped and measured ?
How can we know when we are on a new isolate ?

How do we know we are saturating deno deploy ?  How can we see the queue length ?

How can billing be controlled, so we should stop at a certain amount ?

All these things may be done at once via the sum() kv function.
