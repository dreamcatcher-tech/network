should be able to select from any of the repos that you have access to, which then be bonded with the hash and the provenance of the repo they came from.

A repo is something that shares a consensus boundary.  But that might let branches be run on different consensus ?

If add a pdf, we would turn that in to pure structured text, and give the bot some preample about how we cut up the doc.

When we get back the results, there should be annotations / citations.  We then would take that info and map it back to the file that was provided, so the human sees it based on the way they passed it in.

If the files were too big, we would run parallel threads on them, to figure out if any part of them was relevant.
