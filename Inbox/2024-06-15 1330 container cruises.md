Typical staff ratios of cruise lines are 1:1.2 to 1:3 for most mainstream.
If smartdrawers removed the need for staff, the price could be dramatically reduced.
Also the cost of the cruise ship would be reduced to the platform to carry the containers - if people purchased their own modules or crowdsourced them, price is much cheaper and upgrades are simpler for the ship.

More routes possible since your container can be swapped between ships, or stored on land temporarily.

Also people could travel in their own containers, like a caravan owner.  These units would be self contained requiring only smart drawer services.  This means you can pack your container on land, it can have all your stuff, plus the staff ratio can go way down thanks to the drawers.

Also people can sell their services to each other while on the boat.
further industrial work could be carried out out board while in transit.

Common areas can vary based on tastes.

Emergency liferafts are required as separate things that get carried.
