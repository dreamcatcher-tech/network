Stake against code and then pay a small amount to purchase insurance for vulnerabilities in those modules.

Some people work to keep the code secure and get paid out by the insurance pool.

Like an external bug bounty program that occurs without being asked for it.

When the patches come in, if someone demonstrats a bug, the insurance pool will pay out to them automatically, if they declared the vulnerability, and when someone fixes it.

We can set this system up for AI prompts too, so be able to assail any given chatbot with known prompt vulnerabilities of all kinds, to ensure correct operation.

Can inlcude fuzzing.
