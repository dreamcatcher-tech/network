chat persistence and recovery
sharing chats between runs
running in the cloud, so not on my machine
multiple task navigation, status, progress, completion estimations - like a power dashboard, grouped by project
insert access to the openai web search tool by default, plus maybe code editor ?

attachments of files that are forced into context.

fork the message history, start a new agent at a particular point, or just delete prior messages.  The new agent would need a copy of whatever changes were on disk, in the form of a git patch that gets passed along.  The new agent may check the server to see if new changes have arrived in the meantime ?

Be able to include a file and have it get stuffed in context, or somehow favoured as something the model should look at ?  Some way to auto expand it into context.
