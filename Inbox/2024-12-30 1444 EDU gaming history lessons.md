Make games that recreate actual history, then to level up, you need to show understanding of histroy ?

Or play a certain game scene, and then relate what historical places and concepts this scene is like ?

Provide flash card tools if people want to learn how they can remember things better.

Fully recreate a physical space, normandy landing, so you can actually be part of it, and playing the game is study.

While the game is happening, the ncea or benchmark scores assessment is running, and the weaknesses are being displayed.  Bot asks parents for help in some areas.
