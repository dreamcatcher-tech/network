Make a simple app that takes in audio streams from the browsers on both sides, possibly even using phones or omi devices.

This means we can clean reference audio, with good transcription, and no talking over anyone else which is hard to recognize.

Then when reconciling something and wanting to do a prompt, we can each choose to input our own prompts separately.

These tools would be good for providing streaming advice during meetings or pitches.
