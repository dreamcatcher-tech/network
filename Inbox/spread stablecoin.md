Make an EVM contract that when you send funds to it, it uses uniswap or other services to trade the funds into an even spread between multiple stablecoins.  This spread is there to balance risks around against the failure of any single stablecoin.  It can emergency dump between different coins, or dump out back to Ethereum upon certain risk parameters.
