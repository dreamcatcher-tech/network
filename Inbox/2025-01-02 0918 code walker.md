we should also run the code and observe the outcome.
make the bot guess what will happen, then run it, and correlate.

If the bot can run the code as part of answering a question like "how should I use this code to solve problem xyz" where the options are getting it right, or retreating and trying another approach, then running the code can answer more questions than just reading the code.

Strategy to always score each reasoning branch with a certain likelihood of success, so it always pursues the first say 3 branches in parallel.
