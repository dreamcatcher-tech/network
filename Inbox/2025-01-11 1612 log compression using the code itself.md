The logs should be able to use the code that made the logs to be able to replace strings with pointers in a dictionary.  The time should be compressible too, to a number plus a pointer to a dictionary that provides a formula for how the string was created.

Also if we want to reformat the logs, this should be possible too.

So this is why we should handle logging inside of artifact, for this compression, but also as stricter guarantees of repeatability.
