There is only one thing to watch - the HEAD object.
This is because it is the only point of synchrony.

Then all events need to be deduced from this.

If the writer is also the machine that has the watcher hooks, then it can update the hooks without any polling required.

a nats queue with polling as the backup is about as good as we can get, it we don't have tigris hooks.
