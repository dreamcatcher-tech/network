Can show this when focusing in on an agent, so the total file is visible, and the history is easily navigated.
May have an agent index widget too, that treats the agents like crm records, and lets us present them all in a grid for rapid view.

If we fire up the explorer widget, scoped to a particular path, then this is a better way to present things to the user, plus they can navigate around rapidly.

Clicking on a file in the explorer would cause it to focus, which might cause the stateboard to change.

We could register files and filetypes with viewing widgets, so a nav widget could pass off to a specific viewing widget.
