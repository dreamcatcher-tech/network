The point of the dreamcatcher was to be able to funding against tasks.

So should the solidity side be dumb, and just receive instructions from our bridge ?

We should be able to generate stucks inside the app, and then have funding put against them in eth land, or, be able to transfer funds into gitland, then put those funds against the nfts.
