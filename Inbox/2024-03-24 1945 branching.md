Simply making the name of the branch, verifying that it does not exist in namespace, assigning the base commit to it.  

This assures headlock space.  It should be removed when the branch is removed.

We might take a snap of the last known head hash, so that we can have deterministic branch reporting ?

If we need less than what isomorphic git supplies, then we might be able to migrate wire protocols ?
Prolly should use memfs with an intercept, since dont want to implement a full fs.

Need to convert to pure DSL functions.

If the complete filesystem was all in db, then why have memfs at all ?
IsolateAPI could be the fs object, and can be db backed, locked to a commit, and provide accumulation options.

So the commit operations would just use the isolateapi, they would just have gained access to it last.
Much of what the git lib writes can just be dumped.
In this way, we can totally control the .git file access too, banning it until the git command is due to run.

Have to pass an fs in to the git library.

Go with the full fs implementation, since means we have more freedom to move when moving to s3 buckets, plus have more perf control.
