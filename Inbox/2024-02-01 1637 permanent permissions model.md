In our system, if you had access to a repo, and it gets removed, and you did clone it, you keep having access up to that point.  

So on the hypercomputer, you have a github account, and this is used to manage your access to our system.

When you want to interact with github, you need to use your PAT.

internally, before you can update someone elses repos, we will check your access with github.  Be nice if we could get webhooked updates when permissions change.

Owners are where the account matches the repo name in github.
