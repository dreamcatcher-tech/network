Making an eval for the eval thing itself.

so basically give it a function that it can safely call again and again and get better each time.

make it do its own context window management, where it compresses its window automatically.


doesn't this mean that reading resources would be the way to do file reading ?

so reading the home and the scope would be part of a different toolset that you have to change out to ?

so to do copy paste, with files, you switch to files read, copy the resource, then you switch to write, and paste the resource down.

If this is mastered, then you can copy paste across branches, otherwise you are stuck with needing more scope understanding while the toolset is expanding.

so we have a goal of it needing to complete a task, we have the things it can change, and we have a way to reset, and a way to keep score.

we can also run several runs in parallel, with different seed so we get repeatable but varied results.

so the mcapp knows how to interpret the resources that it shares.
It's instructions document how its tools relate to its resources.

so we should make some basic evals for what we want the dynamic tooling system to do.

make it look at where it failed.
state what we think it should have done.
develop a bunch of theories why it did that.
cross check each on by reasoning.
apply and test each one.
