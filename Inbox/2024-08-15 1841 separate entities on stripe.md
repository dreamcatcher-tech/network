consumption of software seems easy - who we pay out to and how we calculate that, so long as it is logical, should be allowed to be anything we say.

Construction of software, particularly the escrow component, could use rails other than stripe, but if we can get set up as stripe compliant, that would be great.  The key is, can these two pieces be independent ? as in, can ambient attribution function in consumption mode and stripe be ok with how that works, given that the attribution tables change externally ?

If we can avoid being escrow, and clients agree to engage the producer node directly, where the producer node then engages the freelancers, then we are not holding funds on behalf, we are responsible for doing the work, and we retain the work.

Trading of software rights might require that the ownership transfers to the trading entity, and maybe it cannot leave ?  Presumably the purpose is for dispute settlement.

Any particular mode of operation that doesn't fit traditional, we can use crypto for.

Does the right to the completed work need to belong to the trading company ?
Upon completion of the work, and the end of all dispute periods, then the assets could move to the trading company, or to the consumption company.

Minting NFTs is a free service we provide that is akin to a data export.  They would need to pay the gas fees, and we will track the contributions.  Holders of the royalty certificates would be able to convert them to an NFT free of charge, and withdraw from the stripe controlled ecosystem.

How does acquisitions vehicle work ?  This would need to be a separate entity.  We need to main network built out.  Building out the software pieces and acquiring companies seems very separate.  Build the software one first, get that acquired into a pubco, then build up the business buying company, get that acquired too.

Add cooldown period on trades of the items, where the revenue cannot be claimed.  Lets people revoke their purchase decision.  Or forbid sale for anything over the revenue projections ?

The work product must be of fair value and good quality.

We are doing revenue sharing, since the software is licensed under AGPL, and royalty implies IP ownership.  All works are considered derivatives of the dreamcatcher, where Dreamcatcher Command is the holder of all
