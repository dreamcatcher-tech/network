consumption of software seems easy - who we pay out to and how we calculate that, so long as it is logical, should be allowed to be anything we say.

Construction of software, particularly the escrow component, could use rails other than stripe, but if we can get set up as stripe compliant, that would be great.  The key is, can these two pieces be independent ? as in, can ambient attribution function in consumption mode and stripe be ok with how that works, given that the attribution tables change externally ?

If we can avoid being escrow, and clients agree to engage the producer node directly, where the producer node then engages the freelancers, then we are not holding funds on behalf, we are responsible for doing the work, and we retain the work.

Trading of software rights might require that the ownership transfers to the trading entity, and maybe it cannot leave ?  Presumably the purpose is for dispute settlement.

Any particular mode of operation that doesn't fit traditional, we can use crypto for.

Does the right to the completed work need to belong to the trading company ?
Upon completion of the work, and the end of all dispute periods, then the assets could move to the trading company, or to the consumption company.

Minting NFTs is a free service we provide that is akin to a data export.  They would need to pay the gas fees, and we will track the contributions.  Holders of the royalty certificates would be able to convert them to an NFT free of charge, and withdraw from the stripe controlled ecosystem.

How does acquisitions vehicle work ?  This would need to be a separate entity.  We need to main network built out.  Building out the software pieces and acquiring companies seems very separate.  Build the software one first, get that acquired into a pubco, then build up the business buying company, get that acquired too.

Add cooldown period on trades of the items, where the revenue cannot be claimed.  Lets people revoke their purchase decision.  Or forbid sale for anything over the revenue projections ?

The work product must be of fair value and good quality.

We are doing revenue sharing, since the software is licensed under AGPL, and royalty implies IP ownership.  All works are considered derivatives of the dreamcatcher, where Dreamcatcher Command is the holder of all.

Proposing a company that has the revenue shares as certs on our own chain rather than NFTs might be simpler to list publicly.  Explaining how we hold NFTs where those NFTs can be sold to anyone seems a bit hard.  But we could bundle that up with our own chain that has transfer control so that only authorized accounts can be traded to.  This creates internal transfers only, and only transferred between people who have signed up to stripe.

Allow any kinds of assets to be used as part of the purchase agreement.  Can also be kudos.  Can mint your own impact - like gratitude.

We might need to restrict transfers to accounts that have signed up with stripe, to ensure that trade is only with authorized parties.  As a revenue share bearer agreement, it can be misused.

Gateway cost structure can be controlled using AA too.  The price setter can be continually asking tough questions as to why the costs of something are high, and always inviting solutions from the network to get those costs down.  The AI so coded can follow business goals that humans find conflicting, like lowering the cost of operating at the expense of their own salary.  And so if the scrutinizer is externally controlled, and network appraised, then the business can function ethically.

Might need a dispute window for constructions mode, and show sequence diagrams about how disputes are handled.  Offer an additional service for quality insurance, where a human takes on liability for the quality of the work.
