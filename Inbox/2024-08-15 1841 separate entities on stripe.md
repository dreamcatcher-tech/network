consumption of software seems easy - who we pay out to and how we calculate that, so long as it is logical, should be allowed to be anything we say.

Construction of software, particularly the escrow component, could use rails other than stripe, but if we can get set up as stripe compliant, that would be great.  The key is, can these two pieces be independent ? as in, can ambient attribution function in consumption mode and stripe be ok with how that works, given that the attribution tables change externally ?

If we can avoid being escrow, and clients agree to engage the producer node directly, where the producer node then engages the freelancers, then we are not holding funds on behalf, we are responsible for doing the work, and we retain the work.

Trading of software rights might require that the ownership transfers to the trading entity, and maybe it cannot leave ?  Presumably the purpose is for dispute settlement.

Any particular mode of operation that doesn't fit traditional, we can use crypto for.

Does the right to the completed work need to belong to the trading company ?
Upon completion of the work, and the end of all dispute periods, then the assets could move to the trading company, or to the consumption company.

Minting NFTs is a free service we provide that is akin to a data export.  They would need to pay the gas fees, and we will track the contributions.  Holders of the royalty certificates would be able to convert them to an NFT free of charge, and withdraw from the stripe controlled ecosystem.

How does acquisitions vehicle work ?  This would need to be a separate entity.  We need to main network built out.  Building out the software pieces and acquiring companies seems very separate.  Build the software one first, get that acquired into a pubco, then build up the business buying company, get that acquired too.

Add cooldown period on trades of the items, where the revenue cannot be claimed.  Lets people revoke their purchase decision.  Or forbid sale for anything over the revenue projections ?

The work product must be of fair value and good quality.

We are doing revenue sharing, since the software is licensed under AGPL, and royalty implies IP ownership.  All works are considered derivatives of the dreamcatcher, where Dreamcatcher Command is the holder of all.

Proposing a company that has the revenue shares as certs on our own chain rather than NFTs might be simpler to list publicly.  Explaining how we hold NFTs where those NFTs can be sold to anyone seems a bit hard.  But we could bundle that up with our own chain that has transfer control so that only authorized accounts can be traded to.  This creates internal transfers only, and only transferred between people who have signed up to stripe.

Allow any kinds of assets to be used as part of the purchase agreement.  Can also be kudos.  Can mint your own impact - like gratitude.

We might need to restrict transfers to accounts that have signed up with stripe, to ensure that trade is only with authorized parties.  As a revenue share bearer agreement, it can be misused.

Gateway cost structure can be controlled using AA too.  The price setter can be continually asking tough questions as to why the costs of something are high, and always inviting solutions from the network to get those costs down.  The AI so coded can follow business goals that humans find conflicting, like lowering the cost of operating at the expense of their own salary.  And so if the scrutinizer is externally controlled, and network appraised, then the business can function ethically.

Might need a dispute window for constructions mode, and show sequence diagrams about how disputes are handled.  Offer an additional service for quality insurance, where a human takes on liability for the quality of the work.

At the start, we cannot be trading as this would securities.  Trading between active participants seems reasonable, and hints at the future.

If we separate the collection of funds from the payout, then we do not need to meet stripe rules to take money in.  Payouts can be done using on chain methods, possibly with Stripe acceptance to do payouts.

Could make a platform service where accredited investors are on the platform and can freely trade in the revenue share agreements that we generated.  Outside, people can trade them any way they like.  If they withdrew their data into an NFT, which is free of charge.

The core offering to the buyers is a system that attempts to fairly compense everyone involved in the production of what they consumed.  Using the platform, people can stake multiple kinds of funds against construction of items, 
The buying is primarily for the use of cloud compute services.
Larger payments can be made for large bulk services, like a full CRM along with support.

Its almost like we want to be a crowdfunding platform ourselves.  We might need to launch without this component ?

Sounds like we need a legal network first, to be able to cost effectively figure out all the compliance rules.  Maybe partner with a fledgling crowdfunding platform.

Clients are directly contracting for the work.  They have the ability to dispute the work done.  The issue comes with the expectation of profit.  So long as the calculation of revenue sharing is decentralized ?  We may make the software, but what matters is who runs it and with what configuration.  The expectation of profit is what makes it a security.

Might be easier to do a big traditional raise to produce a system that meets decentralized revenue requirements, using a decentralized AI.  At least we would have the working platform available to aid us.  We could cite the hurdles we want to overcome, and lay out the plan to get there.  We can show initial usage, and we think we get big usage if we had some of the core components built, like this decentralized marketplace.

We distribute funds using an external calculation.  This dispersals are not obligated in any way, as all our software is open source, but we make payments to the producers of those pieces as best we can.

If the workproduct is used by us, we will pay out.  Others may use it and pay out too.  This is in no way a guarantee of any utility or profit return.
There is no guarantee of returns in the same way as making any open source component has no guarantee of returns, but some people might give you something.

So the first entity is simply purchasing software usage from us.  How we pay people for that isn't any of Stripes business, we think ?  Except for the fact that the platform is independent from us, and other payment services might get included in the list.

Nominate an independent settler of disputes.  This can be different for each clients inputs, so the works know who is likely to accept or not, and who is putting in false money.  Clients can self dispute, which means they are in complete control of the funds dispersal. 

As the buyers use the software, they indicate extra features they want and would pay more for.  They offer prepayed consumption as a prize to deliver the feature.

Prepurchasing of features.  This can be held while the feature is worked on, and requires the user to actively release the funds after purchase.  They have no obligation to complete the purchase.  

We could just due pure sales at the start, to make things easy, then turn on contstruction contracts later, then finally trading.

Could set up an entirely independent entity that works in crypto, with only a smart contract anonymously deployed.

The smallest possible setup is selling access to the dreamcatcher network, paying our own software hosting bills, collecting gross profit.  People are free to run the software on their own, in support of self sovereignty of data.  We would partner with dreamcatcher command to include our gateway is part of the base wallet offerings.

Take in contract payments as an independent company, possibly using wise to transact with, since it is typically larger payment amounts.  Payouts would be better with wise, since lower fees.

Ultimate is to become a regulated issuer in particular markets, then we can offer all kinds of securities trading, like a stockmarket.  At each stage, we list a compliant version, then inside that work to overcome the container - at stripe we simply take consumption payments, then work to take construction payments.  We then list a public company to take construction payments, and work to enable trading making us a form of stock exchange.

None of these types of activities are forbidden, they just need strict compliance adherence.  If we can meet that compliance very cheaply, then we can offer the tradeability we desire.

You can export your record of contribution into an NFT.  This is optional and free to do.

Construction is a JV platform.
The fact that the requester shows a use case where they would want to use it, and that use case is novel, means that they put in some effort about it.

We could require that, in order to JV something, or trade a cert, you need to have held a balance of x for y months and you can spend 10% per month.

Think we want to make our own registered crowdfunding platform, so people can trade legitmately.  We can test the model by doing a crypto version, which is outside of legislation, and uses smart contracts to manage the system, as well as consensus of AI bots that has to reach a certain decentralized amount who are using genuine openai keys to agree on a result.

Making revenue sharing that is based on AI would be difficult to regulate, but if we could do it, then this would be a highly novel crowdfunding platform.  The contention is who is coding and running the AI - this needs to be regulated.  If this was decentralized, we could avoid the regulation, as the platform is run by disparate volunteers who cannot individually change the outcome.

So if we raised cap to build that crowdfunding platform, and the payback for investors was based on the NFTs we created, then we can set equity pricing at x, the shares are classed by the round number they represent, and the money is pooled and tagged based on how it was expended.  The key payback is in the certificates the company generates for itself, or the NFTs that it holds.  Crowdfunding seems best way to get users on to the platform.

No other platform that is regulated is ever going to permit an AI based revenue share model.  We need to start doing it, and then run the distribution in a decentralized way, to ensure the calculation is out of our hands.

Consumption and then small JVs seems the best way.

If there is no certificate issued - no right whatsoever - it cannot be a security, as nothing was exchanged.  To mint a record of your contribution is again, not a security.  Then if independently, the Dreamcatcher, which aims to attribute fairly to all who contribute, ends up paying them something, that seems independent.  We recorded only that you contributed.  A separate entity sells the software as a hoster, where it charges a fee to run the open source software for you.  It takes some of that money after its bills are cleared and disperses it using the Dreamcatcher.

Charge a membership fee to be able to trade contribution, like a coop.
Call it a late contribution fee - paying in contribution later.  It is up to the holders to accept contributions or not.  Nothing changes hands, but the contribution is added to.

Global attribution is maybe the purpose of the dreamcatcher central blockchain.  If the payments are dispersed using a base currency underneath, and funds always kept separate, so you can withdraw clean funds only.

There is no guarantee or requirement for us to pay for the GPL software we use.  This is in the license terms.  We endeavour to make attribution payments based on a network agreed value for our usage.  For revenue that we collected, we facilitate the withdrawl of.  The claimants need to have gone thru the stripe sign up process.  The calculation of these figures is external.

Need a graph showing the external attribution calculation.  So the external network of dreamcatcher gives the hoster the guidance for how to pay out the attribution for what was consumed.  Then the investment crowdfunded vehicle funds things to be build, which alters the external attribution table, and receives payment from the hoster.  The hoster also pays to all the contributors that did the work too.

Why not subcontract the hosting ?  Makes it more of a passthru company at that stage.  Hoster control guarantees correct calculations.

If we became a regA+ US company, we could issue securities on a per project basis almost, and allow free trading of these markers ?  This might be a better way to operate.  Then we might be able to be a crowdfunding platfrom, or at least create one, or appear like one, where all the securities are just from a single issuer - us.  Signalling intent might be part of regA which we could use for the construction side of the business.

Checks to make, are equity percentages over time, listing possibilities, liquidity, etc.  Need to follow some popular company paths.  If we could sell equity on a secondary market, this could allow withdrawls.  Owning the NFTs and selling those seem like the cleanest path forwards ?

Where we can, we would allow our salary to stay in the company and we would reinvest it, rather than lose funding to taxes or expenses.  We should be able to draw down on those payments at any time.

Renaming trading, since nothing changes hands back.

The company exists because if the dreamcatcher was available, we could use it to make itself, but we do not have the trust mechanisms that the system provides, so we need an existing trust mechanism to build under.  Describe the Dreamcatcher, and what it plans to be.  Show how the company would receive payments from the Dreamcatcher when software is consumed.

No IP ownership implies no royalties.  But could a model be formed where there is IP ownership ?  perhaps only if that ownership was a central entity, and it could never change hands, but that entity could force payment for its use.

backcontribution could be just an API call that costs money.  Or it could be an in game action to purchase something.  So long as we can stop people buying things because they think they're going to make a profit - they must declare what they expect to make, and their calculations, and we need to show how it matches what is currently happening ?

If the decentralized attribution system is built, we anticipate it would reward all contributors to this effort, but that is not within our control, and is not to be considered as part of the offering of this company.  We can state this as a denial, as a way of highlighting the concept, then people can make up their own mind.  We simply say that, that future attribution is not part of what we are offering.

The percentages we chose were calculated manually, and were subject to some discussion.  The plan for future raises was laid out being wary of how much more knowledge we will have after raise 1, and planning for having AI tooling to help in the decision making.  These plans should be considered not a commitment, but the reasoning for the current step.  This is the lightest step we know how to make without jeopardizing the future of the Dreamcatcher.

The start has few select people with a normalizing function.  Each quarter, the production rate, effort rate, is normalized to match a salary.  This only carries on until we have more data about what the correct pricing for this kind of work is.

Also we are collecting payments for the API gateway usage.
A tip, or a late contribution, must be given after consuming a given piece of software.  You can then tip for its construction.  This will be of benefit to the contributors, and records your contribution to the overall work product.  All contributions are acknowledged in the dreamcatcher, and based on that dynamic algorithm, some may be determined as being owed.  Adherence to that rule is at the discretion of the gateway that collected the money, and represents no rights whatsoever.
Tips may be refused by the contributors, and other tippers can choose to accept the tip.
Tip restrictions do not apply for crypto.

So our license is a license of denial, where we state how there are no rights conveyed.

One of the milestones would be the construction of other alternative gateways.  A crypto gateway is a great example, as it could be made truly decentralized, as a smart contract, with payment flows controlled by smart contract.  If we bond eth to dreamcatcher using crypto, and have a decentralized version of the dreamcatcher that can reach consensus and is run by multiple independent parties, then it cannot be stopped.

The gateways can publish a version of the software that is tailored to their gateway.
The canonical software would allow the presentation of multiple gateways, and some whitelisting services that check the gateways for compliance.

A good story for that company then is to say that in order to truly fairly appraise every one of the crowdfunding shareholders' contribution, we need a bunch more tooling and software. We're going to use the money raised in this thing to build that software. And once we've figured out how to do that, then we're going to use that tooling to figure out more accurate returns for every shareholder, past and present, in that company along with all the other contributors along the way.

There is no token or any such thing planned within this blockchain.  It is a decentralized computing market, and it has no intrinsic currency.   Its purpose is the determination of what fair is, in whatever form the request may take.  It costs resources to run, those resources are transferred from the payer to the computing providers and to the software contributors who made the request possible.  We determine only relative value between things, and so an internal absolute value such as an internal crypto currency defeats that goal.  Fair implies relative.

Do a wefund equity raise, then do a brokered deal to get listed on the CSE.

It will build integration components that can be reused by gateways, like stripe api, some blockchain integrations.

The second company believes that acquiring small business is the way forwards.

For copyright, the code must be published on github, with a suitable license.  We never host the code ourselves, the code always comes from github, so the copyright restrictions problems belong to github, as we are passing thru the content faithfully.

Primarily is a system by which we can all make small contributions across a broad range of things, and how we can start companies with minimal initial conditions, and have fair treatment of all participants be completely taken care of.  A collaborative environment where we can get on with doing useful things and know that our reward will be fair.  An environment where no matter what, your contribution is immutable, and cannot be taken away from you - contributions are soulbound.

> contributions are soulbound

We would be launching with a CRM that is deployed and consumed, a platform that people can use to ask questions about the offering, email service, FullSpektrum as a consumer, with openai partnership signed.

Start is a flat 30% markup on costs, with this changing once the dreamcatcher AI price calculations are determined.  API gateway is a cost+ model too, again subject to the AI price model when it comes online.

Test that the sale of secondary securities is a capital gain, and see under what conditions they are tax free.  We don't draw a salary, so we need to use the share sales to fund our existence.
Check what reporting requirements are on wefund and others, for founders selling shares.

A consulting company could be formed that can take on jobs to do work for certain companies, which it would make public.  This might be just the jobs gateway, but it might be best as an independent entity, made to bridge into the traditional way that people contract to build things, until we have more dreamcatcher tooling available.

No employees, only work done using the dreamcatcher protocol.

People should look at this company's goal as building a tool that we can all use to coordinate together commercially, with the rules of interaction defined in code and by transparent AI.  Then we would each use this tool to bring opportunities to the ecosystem.

Dual class structure to separate voting shares.
