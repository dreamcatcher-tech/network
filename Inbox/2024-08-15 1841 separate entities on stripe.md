consumption of software seems easy - who we pay out to and how we calculate that, so long as it is logical, should be allowed to be anything we say.

Construction of software, particularly the escrow component, could use rails other than stripe, but if we can get set up as stripe compliant, that would be great.  The key is, can these two pieces be independent ? as in, can ambient attribution function in consumption mode and stripe be ok with how that works, given that the attribution tables change externally ?

If we can avoid being escrow, and clients agree to engage the producer node directly, where the producer node then engages the freelancers, then we are not holding funds on behalf, we are responsible for doing the work, and we retain the work.

Trading of software rights might require that the ownership transfers to the trading entity, and maybe it cannot leave ?  Presumably the purpose is for dispute settlement.

Any particular mode of operation that doesn't fit traditional, we can use crypto for.

Does the right to the completed work need to belong to the trading company ?
Upon completion of the work, and the end of all dispute periods, then the assets could move to the trading company, or to the consumption company.

Minting NFTs is a free service we provide that is akin to a data export.  They would need to pay the gas fees, and we will track the contributions.  Holders of the royalty certificates would be able to convert them to an NFT free of charge, and withdraw from the stripe controlled ecosystem.

How does acquisitions vehicle work ?  This would need to be a separate entity.  We need to main network built out.  Building out the software pieces and acquiring companies seems very separate.  Build the software one first, get that acquired into a pubco, then build up the business buying company, get that acquired too.

Add cooldown period on trades of the items, where the revenue cannot be claimed.  Lets people revoke their purchase decision.  Or forbid sale for anything over the revenue projections ?

The work product must be of fair value and good quality.

We are doing revenue sharing, since the software is licensed under AGPL, and royalty implies IP ownership.  All works are considered derivatives of the dreamcatcher, where Dreamcatcher Command is the holder of all.

Proposing a company that has the revenue shares as certs on our own chain rather than NFTs might be simpler to list publicly.  Explaining how we hold NFTs where those NFTs can be sold to anyone seems a bit hard.  But we could bundle that up with our own chain that has transfer control so that only authorized accounts can be traded to.  This creates internal transfers only, and only transferred between people who have signed up to stripe.

Allow any kinds of assets to be used as part of the purchase agreement.  Can also be kudos.  Can mint your own impact - like gratitude.

We might need to restrict transfers to accounts that have signed up with stripe, to ensure that trade is only with authorized parties.  As a revenue share bearer agreement, it can be misused.

Gateway cost structure can be controlled using AA too.  The price setter can be continually asking tough questions as to why the costs of something are high, and always inviting solutions from the network to get those costs down.  The AI so coded can follow business goals that humans find conflicting, like lowering the cost of operating at the expense of their own salary.  And so if the scrutinizer is externally controlled, and network appraised, then the business can function ethically.

Might need a dispute window for constructions mode, and show sequence diagrams about how disputes are handled.  Offer an additional service for quality insurance, where a human takes on liability for the quality of the work.

At the start, we cannot be trading as this would securities.  Trading between active participants seems reasonable, and hints at the future.

If we separate the collection of funds from the payout, then we do not need to meet stripe rules to take money in.  Payouts can be done using on chain methods, possibly with Stripe acceptance to do payouts.

Could make a platform service where accredited investors are on the platform and can freely trade in the revenue share agreements that we generated.  Outside, people can trade them any way they like.  If they withdrew their data into an NFT, which is free of charge.

The core offering to the buyers is a system that attempts to fairly compense everyone involved in the production of what they consumed.  Using the platform, people can stake multiple kinds of funds against construction of items, 
The buying is primarily for the use of cloud compute services.
Larger payments can be made for large bulk services, like a full CRM along with support.

Its almost like we want to be a crowdfunding platform ourselves.  We might need to launch without this component ?

Sounds like we need a legal network first, to be able to cost effectively figure out all the compliance rules.  Maybe partner with a fledgling crowdfunding platform.

Clients are directly contracting for the work.  They have the ability to dispute the work done.  The issue comes with the expectation of profit.  So long as the calculation of revenue sharing is decentralized ?  We may make the software, but what matters is who runs it and with what configuration.  The expectation of profit is what makes it a security.

Might be easier to do a big traditional raise to produce a system that meets decentralized revenue requirements, using a decentralized AI.  At least we would have the working platform available to aid us.  We could cite the hurdles we want to overcome, and lay out the plan to get there.  We can show initial usage, and we think we get big usage if we had some of the core components built, like this decentralized marketplace.

We distribute funds using an external calculation.  This dispersals are not obligated in any way, as all our software is open source, but we make payments to the producers of those pieces as best we can.

If the workproduct is used by us, we will pay out.  Others may use it and pay out too.  This is in no way a guarantee of any utility or profit return.
There is no guarantee of returns in the same way as making any open source component has no guarantee of returns, but some people might give you something.

So the first entity is simply purchasing software usage from us.  How we pay people for that isn't any of Stripes business, we think ?  Except for the fact that the platform is independent from us, and other payment services might get included in the list.

Nominate an independent settler of disputes.  This can be different for each clients inputs, so the works know who is likely to accept or not, and who is putting in false money.  Clients can self dispute, which means they are in complete control of the funds dispersal. 

As the buyers use the software, they indicate extra features they want and would pay more for.  They offer prepayed consumption as a prize to deliver the feature.

Prepurchasing of features.  This can be held while the feature is worked on, and requires the user to actively release the funds after purchase.  They have no obligation to complete the purchase.  

We could just due pure sales at the start, to make things easy, then turn on contstruction contracts later, then finally trading.

Could set up an entirely independent entity that works in crypto, with only a smart contract anonymously deployed.

The smallest possible setup is selling access to the dreamcatcher network, paying our own software hosting bills, collecting gross profit.  People are free to run the software on their own, in support of self sovereignty of data.  We would partner with dreamcatcher command to include our gateway is part of the base wallet offerings.

Take in contract payments as an independent company, possibly using wise to transact with, since it is typically larger payment amounts.  Payouts would be better with wise, since lower fees.

Ultimate is to become a regulated issuer in particular markets, then we can offer all kinds of securities trading, like a stockmarket.  At each stage, we list a compliant version, then inside that work to overcome the container - at stripe we simply take consumption payments, then work to take construction payments.  We then list a public company to take construction payments, and work to enable trading making us a form of stock exchange.

None of these types of activities are forbidden, they just need strict compliance adherence.  If we can meet that compliance very cheaply, then we can offer the tradeability we desire.

You can export your record of contribution into an NFT.  This is optional and free to do.
