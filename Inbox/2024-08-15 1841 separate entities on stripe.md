consumption of software seems easy - who we pay out to and how we calculate that, so long as it is logical, should be allowed to be anything we say.

Construction of software, particularly the escrow component, could use rails other than stripe, but if we can get set up as stripe compliant, that would be great.  The key is, can these two pieces be independent ? as in, can ambient attribution function in consumption mode and stripe be ok with how that works ?
If we can avoid being escrow, and clients agree to engage the producer node directly, where the producer node then engages the freelancers, then we are not holding funds on behalf, we are responsible for doing the work, and we retain the work.


Trading of software rights

Any particular mode of operation that doesn't fit traditional, we can use crypto for.

Does the right to the completed work need to belong to the trading company ?
Upon completion of the work, and the end of all dispute periods, then the assets could move to the trading company, or to the consumption company.
