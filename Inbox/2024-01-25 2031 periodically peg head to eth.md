In the git system, periodically we would push the head commit to eth, and let other witnesses agree on that, so we could have some quorum running on the eth chain.

Then if we go get some reputable people to run their own instances of the software, and put their reputation against it, then we can have some trustworthiness in the community.

So when they push to github and sign with their keys, they would also be attesting to their running instances of our software and its inherent correctness ?
