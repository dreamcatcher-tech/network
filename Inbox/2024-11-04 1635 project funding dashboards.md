For any given decentralized project, we should be able to make dashboards that show key metrics like:
1. funds rate - how much money is going to direct things we want, vs the indirect things we want, so we know our ecosystem health as well as our own direct health
2. burn rate on useful things, so we know how much stuff is being completed to a suitable standard
3. ideas rate - how many novel ideas are being extracted from all the activity that is occurring ? 
4. ideas to funding rate, or inversely the idea discard rate


Being able to pull out the list of new topics, reconcile this against the existing knowledge bank, and then state what the atomic ideas are is very useful.  Then to mint this as a dNFT.

The platform needs to be a digital home for us all.

Basically go from discussion to DAO ideas and subjected to consensus rapidly.

We should start by broadcasting our own video calls on the dreamcatcher, minting an NFT, extracting ideas, letting people chat with the NFT, pay tips, and other things.
