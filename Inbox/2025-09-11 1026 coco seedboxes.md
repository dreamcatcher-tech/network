the torrenting can be done thru a vpn.  the vpn knows which coco made what requests, so can pass on the takedown notices.

because the computing was confidential, the clients can be confidential too,  so we could trace which browser anyone connected with, but we couldn't prove what they did.

you could switch the coco around different locations, and then send a message in to some other coco, like a mixer or a tor network.

part of the blockchain is we provide exit nodes.  some are white, and some are dark.
