Want to trigger a pull on the root repo, as the superuser.
Pull from github into the base branch.

Somehow trigger all the actor branches to update too ?

If the actor branches, each action, automatically pulled in the parent branch, if anything changed since last time ?

Then if children, each action, pull in from parent ?
but not every time, since that pollutes history ?
Maybe merge in from root actor directly ?
