With large datasets, the question always haunts operators: "Did anything change ?"

Diffing of the "main view" is a way to provide this certainty.  There is always a main view of an app, for the CRM it is the customer list, on a map.

Being able to take the current view, and show a diff view of what customers used to be like can give certainty that the system operates correctly.

Diffing on a map would color code sector changes, and color code customer sector membership.
