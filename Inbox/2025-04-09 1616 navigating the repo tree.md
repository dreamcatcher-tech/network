It might pay to be able to refer to repo names using posix paths.

In that case, `cd` is a form of checkout.

also for super, how can we do the equivalent of `su` where we allow the user to switch to a user account that they have control over ?

The cli should be able to move files in and out of the local disk.
Should also be able to create a local git repo, and push and pull it maybe ?
