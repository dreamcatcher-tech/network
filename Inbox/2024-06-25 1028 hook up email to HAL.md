If we were able to offer a single price for all of a company email plus it had all this ai tooling built in, this is a great competitive offering to them.

If they want buttons, they can have buttons, but these are just prompts that get configured and then pushed.

Should allow chatting up a UI with buttons by simply buffering in the shortcuts.  The buttons could include some AI processing to be context aware.

So if the company email could be ingested, and then fully hosted, in a much more transportable format, this could make up our core offering.

Then make bots that can be published using a domain.
Add a domain purchasing and management service to shop around for you, keep things updated, and let you lease or let out the domains while you aren't using them.
