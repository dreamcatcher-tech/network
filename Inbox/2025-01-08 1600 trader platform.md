How can a generalised prediction market be made? So taking the idea of traders as teams and algorithms where traders and algorithms can have a following whose stake behind them and then the yields are released. So it gives the traders leverage and it gives the followers gains. It can be set up some ways so that the followers can have some buffers and they can also have some type of combination of multiple algorithms with different rules to follow. But if you're doing this for crypto markets you might as well do this for prediction markets as well. And this can be extrapolated out to Wikipedia edits where you stake to say where people who say things can stake money against it and other people can stake money against it so that when it's consumed those people get a small payment. Because they are asserting at penalty of slashing that the information is correct with some kinds of conditions like genuine errors are forgiven and other such things but different grades of assertion can be given.

Use this so people can gamble on stucks - gamble on which AI will be the best one while in training, as well as gambling on which stucks are the best ones to buy on.  If the stucks are AI managed, then we are effectively gambling on the AI - which ones will achieve their goals, and which ones will meet market success - these can be conditional.

These standard bets are like project management bets, which signal liklihood of completion, and all the AI's should take heed of these.  If the stucks are standardized, then just like stocks are standardized, the trades and bets can be standardized too.

Non standard is free for anyone to create, so long as someone else takes on the bet, and we can make AI that can check the offerings for scamminess.

**Idea:**

Create a universal staking platform for crowd-based correctness and predictions:

1. **Core Mechanism**
    
    - Participants (individuals or algorithms) submit predictions or claims.
    - Followers stake behind these predictions/claims.
    - The market outcome (or verification event) determines yield distribution (or slashing).
2. **Algorithmic Teams + Followers**
    
    - Multiple algorithms or human traders compete.
    - Each develops a track record.
    - Followers allocate stakes to one or more strategies, potentially diversifying via “algorithmic bundles.”
3. **Buffs + Slashing**
    
    - Buffers can mitigate follower risk (e.g., partial insurance pool).
    - Slashing for incorrect or fraudulent claims.
4. **Extended Use Cases**
    
    - Crypto/DeFi predictions, sports, or other on-chain events.
    - Wikipedia-like knowledge staking: editors assert correctness at risk of stake slashing, reward distribution for verified accuracy.
5. **Gradations of Assertion**
    
    - Different “tiers” of confidence—higher stakes yield higher potential gain but more slashing risk.
    - Forgiveness policies for genuine mistakes or updated data.

This unifies prediction markets and knowledge-proof markets under one contract-driven model where correctness and accuracy are financially incentivized.

It could be huge, the supply of a knowledge market, with stake to say.
