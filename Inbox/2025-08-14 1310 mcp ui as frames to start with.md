If we present back in to the lobe ui as a stateboard frame, and allow the frames to have mcp access to artifact, then the chats in lobe become just the top level chats before we commit too deeply.  Lets us have something working in the meantime.

Then we would have artifact mcp be included in the base of lobe and pass along the clerk token.

This would become a system plugin, like artifact, and would have its own prompt injection.
