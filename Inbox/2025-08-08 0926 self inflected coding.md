get it to make a jitter and then have the bot be able to control the jitter form the outside by using tool calls, and you be able to control via widgets.

Provide a base for the tool to start from, and clear prompting.

The builder might be separate from the user ai.

The builder could run in parallel in the background and they compare notes and wisdoms about how they want things to work, so they collab better.

this is possible if the inside of the frame is presented as an mcp server to the llm on the outside.

It could have basic functions like screenshot, move mouse, so it could always drive it like a regular webpage, but if it makes itself an api in there, and exposes it as tools, it can get more direct control.

Getstate can be used to get the layout state of the page, and other information, in model based terms.  The data model would be arranged in nested json, then the graphics model would be arranged pointing at paths in the json model.
