pass redirects down the chain, so that each node fly redirects to its child, eventually making to the agent at that path at that instant in time.

later, represent this state in a git repo.

use state that comes with the redirect, which might be just an array of remaining path attributes to resolve, and then you pop one off, then fly redirect again.

agents have children and so far, an agent can only create a direct child.
