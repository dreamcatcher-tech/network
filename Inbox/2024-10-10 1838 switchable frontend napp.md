Depending on taste, can start with different napps as your valet.

Front end should be reasoner, and a collection of napps it can call on.

Once of those napps is the napp to navigate the nappstore to find other things.

So you can program it with tests and you or others can tweak your very own version.

A napp could be dynamically configurable if a user changed some preferences, and then the sysprompt would get dumped and changed.  There would be tests that ran against this change, as it would be like changing the agent based on a tool call.

The initial tool will always get called to allow some logic to be entered.

Package needs to state what its entry language is, so the runner would be deno, ts, python, etc.
