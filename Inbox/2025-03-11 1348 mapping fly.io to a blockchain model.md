"Your Fly.io network is essentially a global, encrypted LAN" - so we need a way for running services on chain to contact other services.

We want a way to have realtime streaming between running processes.

Other tenants should be able to deploy the same infrastructure as us and then be compatible, so we would be seen to run by two politically separate orgs.
