Publishing HAL as an app to be consumed is different to having it built in to artifact in some way.

So if artifact is considered a blockchain network that handles resilience, availability, confidentiality, then HAL needs to be just an app upon that.

It is an app because each user has private data, the users collaborate with each other using this app.

Artifact, while having some elements possibly augmented by AI, at its core is not an AI system - it is build to contain, cradle, and utilize AI systems.  Its core is integrity, availabilit, authentication, scale.

Artifact has no AI elements. 

When we go to use AI for consensus, the AI will be called within an artifact context, rather than something built in to artifact.  

So then the question of HAL design becomes how to use Artifact to run an app, rather than how to make HAL itself.

Set data in config to provide chainIds when cloning repos ?
Or, sign tags ?

The chainId is then the earliest crypto signature tht checks out all the way thru.
When you pick a commit, the chainId of that commit is the earliest retrievable signature that is valid all the way thru.
