making a stream to track latest and then make sure we don't miss anything should be a standard mechnism we supply, rather than having to hack our way around it often.

we know the parent child relationship of commits, so for any given commit, we can walk back to know if we've seen it, or if we missed anything in between.

the signers of the commits should add a counter, or a crypto height, so that the number of sigs they produce always goes up ? this might make a bottleneck.  This could help us see quickly if we've missed anything ?
