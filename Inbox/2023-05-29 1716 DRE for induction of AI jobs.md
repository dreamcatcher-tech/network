So many people want little bits of AI help here and there, but where can they go to get tuning help ?  They should come to Dreamcatcher, and use AI to specify their task, then set a price on it and have a taskforce set about making and testing the thing they want.  Whoever wants something and is prepared to fund it, for sure other people will want that thing too.

This is why their businesses should be considered platforms, rather than disconnected stacks of uncooperative software.  Each vendor is in the business of software, but the company is in the business of something else, so the incentives do not align.

Ventsoft should really be seeds into AI, where the output gets rewired and highlighted / de-emphasized to help the human get their point out with the least number of words.

Spam processor that hooks up to all your channels, like linkedin and facebook, then digests all the messages and all the news and highlights just the things that you would probably want to see, then it summarizes them all for you.

## The AI API
In Dreamcatcher we can treat the AI frontend as our own, and use this to charge people in the interim while we get ambient attribution online.  This can also act like the public chain, where you pay to have things done on it.  Then, we do attribution based on this payment fee, since this is the same as gas to the public chain, which is unavoidable.  And so some of the purchase of this API usage can be diverted into our own native store of value, that we will redeem in exchange for some of the incoming payment as in [[2023-02-22 1149 Immediate Currency]]

Customers of the API are incentivized to keep paying our instance because this is the only one that is going to give them ambient attribution for their early purchases.  Also the only that uses some of their payment to improve the system, provide maintenance, and attempt to fold their use case into more general use cases to lower costs and increase reliability.
