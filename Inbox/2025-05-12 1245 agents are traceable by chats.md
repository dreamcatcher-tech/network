Each time an agent takes an action, it should present itself as a chat where the agent did something considered its total context and then gave some response that might have been a tool call. 

In this sense, the agent is acting like the person, and so the agent can read from certain things. The structure of an agent repo is probably the same as an actor repo except it's bonded to this AI agent that can do anything within it. 

I think structurally the difference is that an agent needs a whole repo just like an actor does, whereas if you try and make an agent as a sub-part of any given repo, it starts to look more like a collection of tools rather than something that has context and identity.

The purpose of an agent, I believe, is so that it can hold its full context of all the things it has done in the past and bring them to bear against the things it has been asked to do.
