Goaling being of the form SVO, we should also detect count, so if we think that the operation will need to be done lots of times, we search for ways of doing that.  If we have isolated a lensing function, we can then call a multithreader to do things many times for us.

From any given chat, the machine should be aware of how it did things, so that it can draw a mermaid diagram depicting what it has done so far.

Collaboratively work on all these modules in VR with the area in the filesystem represented by a physical space so you can see other people working on similar areas, like being able to see other traffic users on github and see what other people are browsing, particularly if they enable working in the clear.  Then can do queries on the things they did so you can find friends and be of service more.
