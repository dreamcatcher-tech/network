`minimal` to set the page layout
picks an agent, and or a frame.
the agent might boot with a frame, and some loaded front matter, like some text, some markdown, or some starter questions.

the starter questions might be generated from the context.

if this is your first bot, then you are heavily anchored to this agent, and might need to do some work to get the ui back to pristine.

It needs to look like a discord channel - you can be in many servers

so the agents that can host would be the server in discord, then all the channels are just to help organization, as well as the private groups that people start on the server - the agent can see it all.

When you connect with the dao agent as a friend, you can end up dropped in a group chat with them and all the others connected to it ?

When you first land, you would land with a one on one chat with this agent, which is the same as if you connected to a person and started chatting.

you can ask to join the full blown channel, or see the channels this agent can invite you to.

We should let you see the page view, before you are asked to create an account.
