Used for splices, pierce watching.

? should it be available inside isolates so they can be triggered when something remote happens ?

Easiest as an async iterable, but needs a broadcast ability.

When starts up, gets the most recent value, if anything.

Commits should be buffered for a PID.

When the last subscriber unhooks, the db watch should be torn down.

? does anyone need to watch head without getting the commit ?

Used primarily to watch a full file path.
Might get used to watch a path within a json file.
