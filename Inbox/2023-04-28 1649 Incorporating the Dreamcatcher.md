DAOs can be registered in the Marshall Islands.  This could be the perfect place to register the Gateway company which holds funds in escrow and makes payments out.  It is non profit, and so should be free of all tax on Marshall Islands, which would otherwise tax gross revenue at 3%.

Marshall Islands allows Wise.com business accounts to be held.

This seems a cleaner, safer place with more modern laws to run the escrow company.  Shares of the company can be given automatically to represent the escrow amounts in the company, should it ever need liquidating.  These shares can represent the contributions being made, and can be branded and artistic.  Restrictions on their trade can be set to avoid securities laws.

Then we need to incorporate a working company whose goal is take funds, and expend it on NFT production, selling off the assets.  Participants get minted a token as a share, and can trade these between other members of the company, or with anyone who has passed the KYC test.  This then passes off the NFTs that it funds over to the shareholders who contributed at the time the packet was committed to.

The DAO structure could allow very large cap tables.
