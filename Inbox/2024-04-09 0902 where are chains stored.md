Must store them all flat in the db.

What about handling a specific commit ?  How frequently should the root be updated ?

Billing should be somehow pegged to this base chain.

Definitely we have a users home account chain.

Add a ulid at the front of every PID that represents the dreamcatcher account ?  This could be a public key or hash of a list of public keys that are allowed to interact with that chain ?
Could be the chainId ?

The correct way is to support submodules, but we might not have that available in isomorphic-git.
