or should we have a different config file, named the workspace manifest ?

each agent may call on some git repos to get some work done ?

maybe this is an optional section, so the face can require some files to be there for it to operate correctly, but then the agent itself, as a whole can specify git repos too ?

it can be overridden to handle latest or a specific commit or branch.

yes, in the agent definition.
faces can ask for subfolders ?
