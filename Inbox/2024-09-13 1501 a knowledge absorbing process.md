Given a body of knowledge, make some agents that can hit it from all kinds of angles, ask clarifying questions of the user, do some web research, and ultimately produce a fine tuned model that has within it the knowledge you gave it.

Then whenever it answers, it seems to intimately know this knowledge that it was given.

It might reject if what you're teaching it is counter to what its bulk training is, or if it is untrue.
