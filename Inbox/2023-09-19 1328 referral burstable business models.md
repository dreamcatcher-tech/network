For a waste collection company, a referral system, and then a service that is like uber, in that you can call a collection or schedule at your liesure.

Create incentives with the service.  Eg: get neighbours to share a bin, so can help people collaborate using the tools.

Basically have a super easy interface to the company that is powered by intelligent chat, rapid connection to a relatable human, burstable staff for phones and drivers, revenue share to all including developers.

Referrers earn fees too.

Then offer service marketplace.
