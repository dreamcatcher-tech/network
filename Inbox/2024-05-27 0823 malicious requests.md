We need to survive against multiple different kinds of requests.

The dangerous ones are ones that cost us resources but are not assosciated with any billable account.

So we should allocate based on ip address or additional fingerprinting.
With each machineid, we should store the fingerprint information, and log it in the defense system, in case it needs to change.  The defense system should be a git structure so it is portable.

Set some free tier limits, so limit how many new machines an IP address can construct.

If the system comes under too much load, we can start requiring hash proofs to be generated for each one.
