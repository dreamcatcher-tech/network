Find duplicate packets that mean the same.
Break apart large packets to find components, then deduplicate those components across other actors.

Upload all your packets, then our instance of AI gives back lists of duplications.

Simplify a packet description, summarize it.
Check for consistency.
Clean up the writing, or add more specifics.
Make the description be more direct / use less words.

Basically a bunch of wordsmithing tools that helps humans enter data easier, and helps them find each other based on similarity of packets.
