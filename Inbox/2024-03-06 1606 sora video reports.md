Generate movies using metaphors to describe the state of the system we are reporting on.
When the human notices something and asks about a detail, the video moves to show the detail and amplify the detail for the user.

Harnesses how our brains can notice items better than we can read text and graphs and other things.

Could also generate 3d worlds that represent the current state and a report on state changes over time, so humans can view the data more effectively, in ways that have meaning, so even a novice user can spot differences.

Then, being able to chat and make your own indicators and measures, you can make your own world to view the data, and set up your own alerts.
