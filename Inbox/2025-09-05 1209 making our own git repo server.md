because we need speed, and don't want to hammer github, we could run our own git server, and this could be slaved to github.

So high frequency access happens on our layer.

This feels like the next step after we prove out the model using github.

after that, if it still looks good, then we make the nfs version for speed.

just seems like no utility gained, except decentralization, from the blockchain.

virtual filesystem is good for economy and speed, not actual functionality.
