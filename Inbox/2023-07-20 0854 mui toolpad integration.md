[MUI toolpad](https://mui.com/toolpad/) is a lowcode environment.  We should be able to integrate with this very easily, using our chains as the backend.  This would make an offline first app easy to make rapidly, but also fully online ones.

There is a different kind of interface coming - a chat based one - and we should be able to drop this component in too.

It would have some requirements you need to fill out, like what is your dictionary, and how are some actions done.  This should be covered by the descriptions in the api file.  These knowledge blocks should be stored and prioritized so a human can manage this body of knowledge over time.

The app should ask you, the admin, clarifying questions based on what users keep asking.
This knowledge would form the backbone of the app, which the ai would digest to answer users conversationally.
