Somehow, in the UI interface, we want to be able to write to some messages, or a list of tasks, in some order that we want to carry out.

So thruout the day, i would add things in tasks that I want to cover. 
The AI would make sure they kept being done, would dedupe and merge them.  May even NFT them.

name the location
share the file
make the format
attach the widgets
