Once we have this piece, then we can go and privately raise to construct an AI to make investment decisions for us.  This should be private, bx as soon as it is public it will stop working.

Maybe it could act as the moral compass and be wired into GPT generally ?  Internally it can reason about these fairness aspects, then it can draw on that in any conversations it has.

Making a demo of how this platform can work would go a long way to being able to raise for it.
If we raised on the crappy version, with the base rules in place, then we can raise for a better version, where the payback is covered by this higher fidelity algo, using GPT5.

Asset Allocation AI would be the real money spinner, if we only had the impact assessment too.
Assert alloc is a very different beast, and can be kept proprietary.  Many such propperietary things can exist, some public.

If we had solid math formulas, then justice should be promptable, and we might not need anything more than that.
