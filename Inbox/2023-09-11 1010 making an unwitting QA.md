If we can air drop attribution to anyone, then we can also make them a QA.

For example, if we ask for a feature in xstate, we can make @davidkpiano the qa for that change.  He can also be used as a signal or component, so if he approves a pull request that puts the feature in, then our QA is tasked with only ascertaining if the change we asked for has made it in to the branch, and that we can attribute accurate, then the funds are released.  Or davidkpiano can do the QA actions directly.
