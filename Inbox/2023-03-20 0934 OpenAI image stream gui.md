Make a git style tree where we show the progress of people toying with prompts to get what they want.  They can record every prompt they make, or "tag" the ones they think are important.

Merge tries to smoosh the prompts together.

Images can be used as inputs for further images.

Lets multiple people see the flow of development to arrive at a final point.

Stitch different areas of an image together, then get AI to blend them into one.

Use chains to allow multiple simultaneous queries to be taking place, and we handle the payments for you.  Let you blend multiple different AI generators.  Make an online image editor suite that is modular, and extensible, with a tool button framework, heavily weig

The business model is charging for AI usage, where we handle the api interaction.  We pay the model providers, or run our own instances if the engines are available.  A portion of this cut goes to the tools that were used to generate the load, and so it uses the dreamcatcher attribution algo to incent expansion of the tooling.

You can bring your own compute, and run this yourself to reduce costs or enhance privacy.
