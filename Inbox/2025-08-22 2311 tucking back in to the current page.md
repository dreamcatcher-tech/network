if we made an mcp server that exposed the current page as a server accessible scope somehow, then it could run an mcp server, that would let it name chates, and otherwise interact with the webpage, by making tool calls.

so if the page had some simple mcp controllable properties, like renaming chats, then it can be controlled from inside the chat.
