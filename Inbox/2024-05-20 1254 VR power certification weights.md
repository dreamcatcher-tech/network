Make a sensor that shows how much power you expended, like in a deadlift, that can be used as energy in a game.  The devices are certed so people can't cheat.  Should show up in VR so you can grab it, or make it part of the controller, so you make energy by holding and pulling in a static position.  The longer you hold a higher force, the more energy you get to play with, but it does decay.

In a team you can all channel your energy to be weilded by a single person.

If we make a system that can generate games rapidly, then we can likely find a viral game faster, rather than iteratively trying a limited number of shots.

So the game design is AI simulated.
