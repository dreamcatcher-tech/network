In a number of developed cities around the world, there are ferry terminals where a very large amount of foot traffic goes through on a daily basis as part of people's regular routines. What might be useful is to have a small stand that offers a pick-up and collection service for people at those locations. This would be significantly cheaper than picking up from their homes because we also get double coincidence of location as well as double coincidence of time because you know they need to have processed the pickup ready for us to grab it.

This would include things like laundry services, some shopping, they could add tasks along the way, could be their mail, we can interact with them during the day. Anything really. These little stores would act like a way for them to get tasks done in their local township. Collect things - parcel addresses things that they want posted or mailed. There can be little mini processing steps like take these objects and list them on Trade Me or something like that. So it's really just a services hub now. 

Just to get going, we could supply this out the back of a van where we made a modular system for the vans to be loaded and unloaded so that people know where those locations are. 

Finally, we can do shopping in the local supermarket where at the can know what's in the store and a person can just walk around and it just tells them that they're in the area and what to get visually which makes picking significantly simpler. This app alone could be useful to the online store order fulfillers. It is of course a temporary measure for when all the foodstuffs become automated, but nonetheless the Deno Principle of services seems sound.
