The DID represents the root of the environment that that entity has control over inside the hosting platform.  To perform operations inside  that environment, you need to prove authentication with the DID it belongs to.

External access can be granted, when someone makes a public version of the repository, but ultimate control rests with the DID.  The DID is responsible for paying the bills.
