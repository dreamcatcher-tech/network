this server lists resources that can be connected to by a web browser, like vscode hosted, or even an ssh shell.

this is how clients can be the live stream, the past tasks, or the url for accessing the vscode host.

artifact then, if requested, presents these resources as urls that clients can connect to, and it acts as a relay after auth, giving access to auth'd clients.
