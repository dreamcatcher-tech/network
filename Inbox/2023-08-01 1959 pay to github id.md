We could make a contract that allowed us to list the beneficiaries of a packet as the holders of the gpg key of a certain github commit.  We could be an oracle that injects assertions of proof, or we could be able to verify some keys on eth chain.

If we were on dreamcatcher, then we can verify using genuine gpg, and so the funds can be unlocked in this way.
