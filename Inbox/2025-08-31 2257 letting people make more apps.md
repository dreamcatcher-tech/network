currently we've been saying one user per app, but this need not be the case ?

This is probably where you would make an org.

users must be one to one with apps.
Every user has at most one app, or the app is in a lifecycle process.

if they can make orgs, then they can control those apps separately, or with other people.

just need to be careful not to be controlled by fly's designs.
