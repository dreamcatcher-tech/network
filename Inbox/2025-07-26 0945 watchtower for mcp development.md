We really want a trawler to go round looking for topics and concepts that we are interested in, and also helping us clarify what we are trying to achieve.

so like searching for mcp server developments that handle ui elements.

like watching https://github.com/zaidmukaddam/scira-mcp-chat which is a good ui, so we want to see how they are developing, and make a quick summary card of changes.
then swipe up and see prior cards relating to this thing.

its like we need some bots to help keep track of all the massive recombinations that are occuring across the programming space.  It needs to capture our preferences and tastes and keep crawling the idea space.
