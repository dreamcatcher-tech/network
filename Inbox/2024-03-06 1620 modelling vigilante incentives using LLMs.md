If we develop a set of rules for a system, we should be able to model large amounts of behaviours within it.

The interface to our apps should always be text, so that it can be simulated easily.
So any changes to the app are immediately inducted into the simulation so we can see how the output is expected to change.

Set up things like engagement scores.

We can model parts of a system we have no control over, and see how the system plays out.  We can use this to push for change in the system, such as modelling the incentives in the legal system, or benefits systems.

We should be able to model the dreamcatcher itself, and include any policy changes we are contemplating.  Model existing innovation networks, like closed source companies.
