when making the chats napp, we need to be able to run the code in a testing form.
plus it needs to export some library featrues, so that people can import it into frames.

this would be the useChat hooks - basically mirroring the ai sdk interface, or providing some basic pieces that can use this sdk frictionlessly.

test using mocks and other features.
