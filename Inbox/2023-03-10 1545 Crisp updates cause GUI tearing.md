If the lift is slow to come down for the next root pulse, then the GUI redraws with a pulse that has no children.

If we have no completed pulse, then just draw the last full pulse ?  But this doesn't work if we still haven't loaded everything, since must be able to operate while the crisp is loading.

Crisp updates are always from the top down - never sidways - so there is never any need to 

Could cause the next crisp to never be pushed out unless the complete tree has been baked ?
If we have nothing, then release the crisp progressively.

Want a graeful update, where if we are uncertain, the crisp acts like the last crisp, but if we are certain, then it acts definitely.
