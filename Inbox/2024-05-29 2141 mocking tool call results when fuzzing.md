Writing helps is easier than coding since it is NL, and it can be upgraded by a bot as a result of synth testing.

But when it has to do tool calls, we need to account for different values of the results.

With highly advanced models, we should be able to get it to reason its way thru choosing a reasonable range of fuzz test tool results to be able to sprinkle its way thru most combinations of prompt and tool call.
