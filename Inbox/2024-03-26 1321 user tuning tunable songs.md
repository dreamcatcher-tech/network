If an artist submits their notebooks then we can train on their writing style.
Particularly if they use our tools and correct it on the fly, we can hone in on them better.

Idea is that we can play tunes that are particularly uniquely tuned to a user and their situation.  
Can let other people pay to compose using that artist.
Can get little clips of the artist endorsed.

Artist may adopt some songs and popularize them - upside for all

Hearing a song dedicated to your situation is monetizeable.
