Using AI to maintain these libraries, we should be able to maintain multiple different paradigms of interface concurrently.

We should be able to list out all possible design types by copying every other rpc based interface out there, and just wrap around that - they all reduce down to the same mechanics.

Then we have every paradigm on every language, so surely there's one you like.

We can pick one for you by looking at code you have written in the past to use patterns you are most familiar with.

If there is some other pattern we can say either why it doesn't work, or we can raise a flag to generate it, and you might get it in a couple of hours.  This is a feeling of responsiveness that people interacting with libraries never get.

So if you raise a github issue, then we would instantly reply with some high quality bot response, and we would try to do some of the work.  The work attempts would be shown inline with the issue as a PR, and then the questions of the issue would be asked in relation to that PR.

So you could connect your project up to be managed by us, and it will instantly provide responsive issue results.  Plus it can ask for money to fix things.  It can be a small amount, like $5.

You can sponsor us to work on other projects, in which case you will get the credits for the work.

Lift all the open source projects in the world, and provide napp wrapped and patch-master managed versions.
