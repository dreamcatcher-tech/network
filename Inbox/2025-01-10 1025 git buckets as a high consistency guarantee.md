Using the git format, we can offer bucket level costs, bandwidth, and paralelism, but using git to ensure strong consistency.

Separate out the consistency from the storage, and remove the issue of mutation since CAS does not mutate, but instead CoWs.

This can make the git service suitable as a highly consistent database.

Atop this database, we build application execution services.
