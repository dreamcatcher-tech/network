Seed it with a topic, and a human expert will give you some structure and spit out a first draft, so it isn't just pure machine.  Any kind of letter writing can be done by a human, and the platform is learning each time.  Plus we can charge more since humans.

Everyone offering professional writing services should be going thru our platform.

They can reach more clients, and can amplify their skills, plus can collab with others, plus get paid fairly, and get attributed for what they train our platform with.  They can request new features and get them quicker.

Start trying to acquire little niche groups and forums on the website, and monetize them by selling products directly thru them, enabling trade between parties on the site, for favours and for actual paid services, also convert the hep they give into something universal, and pay them back for it.  Give members better deals from bulk purchasing arrangements.
