Our biggest problem, was always how to see inside a running calculation.

Turns out that, the key to the whole thing, was to make this view inside be the fundamental user interaction.

So basically the user enters the system inside an isolation container, and can see the world by jumping around looking inside these containers.

Indeed, inside those ephemeral in flight containers, in the working state, is where all change happens.

The commits just lock down whatever happened in those states.
