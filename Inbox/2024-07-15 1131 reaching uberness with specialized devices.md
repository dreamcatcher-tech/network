Uber is easy to saturate since cars are plentiful.  Rubbish trucks are specialized devices however.

If we could have an uber service that lets regular trucks pick up other customers waste for a fee, then we can start to have white labelled trucks ?

If we can get saturation in the specialty trucks, our service would always be the most convenient.

Then if we can be multimodal, like a rubbish truck can also do gas delivery, can also do other kinds of rubbish using a standardized drawer based system, things can be better and the vehicles could be cheaper.

If the trucks are just drawer based, then any vehicle can carry them.

Bins should be drawer shaped, but could also just dump into a draw based storage system, so the waste doesn't need a specialized truck.

Once standardized, these can be dumped at a depot, or join the matternet, which makes them easier and cheaper to handle.

A mulcher could turn up in a drawer, and be used to mulch waste into drawers giving you near limitless capacity.
