Current practices for product management place a min size on a piece of software before it can come to market.  Then below that, small open source "hobby" efforts occur, with some making it over the chasm to product.  The utility that is missed in the chasm is huge.

If micropayments could be connected to the apps, and a form of decentralized product management occur, then we are able to touch these areas that are out of reach.

This will result in more products crossing the chasm, since the chasm is lowered.
