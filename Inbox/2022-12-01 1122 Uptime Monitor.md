Demo an easy to create uptime monitor that has strong resilience.

Allow it to operate in netsplits, so each node reports what it can see from whatever network it is connected to.

Offline first net probe - designed for measuring offline first systems.  Should be able to make each peer be a monitor and report what they see to each other where it is accumulated.

People can purchase and trade uptime monitoring services.

Making a monitoring system is normally quite hard, but using our host chain it should be fairly simple.
