compliance burdens are going up.
companies are increasingly outsourcing their compliance.

get a company that requires certs to operate.
make it agentic so the outcome is better, but the operating costs are much less.

compliance bot, like an alexa puck, that sits on a desk and gives feedback on everything that's going on.

but that delivery mechanism, of the puck, is almost better for all forms of intelligence.

purchase the compliance companies, roll them up, expand, sell the bundle, has bundle premium but also an ai premium.
