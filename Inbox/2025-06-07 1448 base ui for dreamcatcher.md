Maybe all the ui elements don't need to be a mock ?

Problem is having each one be its own repo is a bit laborious ?

If we had a stackblitz starter, this might help some ?

but then, we would want to switch to our own on chain stuff quite fast ? 
this would eliminate stackblitz from the loop ?
Start by pulling in repos into our platform, and then work on them there - rally round github as the integration exchange point.


in codex environments, always clone down the latest reference project and make codex keep everything in sync.

so this painful loop only applies until we can get our own bots up.
which might not be that long, since the number of widgets would stabilize, and then napps would begin to form, which should be done in codex.

and then how do we pull in the trucking stuff ?
make that a frame, and load it in a stripped down version of the system ?
Or we could make it be a single app with no framing, since it seems maybe small enough for that ?

Or, make it a single frame, and it handles run cards and customers as a single thing.
Then it can still run as a frame, but also it can run as a standalone thing ?

how can we dual develop the main platform and their piece ? doing one or the other seems zero sum ?

so prove we can get good bolt.new results in a framed item.
if not, then we'll have to seed with bolt.new, codex over to a frame, wait for our platform to be made.

seems best to just use bolt for the flop, as a starter pack, then rely on codex to bed it in ?
to use our framework requires specific training and prompting. so it might be wasted effort to rely on bolt, if it doesn't work first pop.

make a github template ui so can create template with all the settings for pages already there ?
