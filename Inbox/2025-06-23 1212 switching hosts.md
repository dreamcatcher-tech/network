on the fly, we could store the chosen host in localstorage ?

Each host should expose an endpoint that gives data like its privy app id, and other parameters, to let clients auth with it ?

so in the front end, to switch hosting providers, we'd select one from the list, and it would cause a page refresh and re-auth with the privy app using the new app id.

migration is a different story.

publishers of the front end can then be separate from the back end hosters.
the billing might be separate again, and might use eth or  something ?
front end gets paid by the backend, using this fair method.
