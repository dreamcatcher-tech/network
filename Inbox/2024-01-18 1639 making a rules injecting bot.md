The simplest case for curtains bot is to make a tool to go thru lists of rules, and then put those rules into the prompt for the bot.

Then have some tests that are set up and run on the bot whenever the rules changed, generating a final score for the system, letting people hone in on particular areas that need improvement.

We could make rules on what the prompts needed to be, such as making sure they are atomic.

We can add derivations, so we can get the catalogue to be consistent with all the rules.
