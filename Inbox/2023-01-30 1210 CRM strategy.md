Make complete app work for small numbers of fake customers generated live.
This means the logic is always current and can be confident the basics work.

Then generate large numbers of customers to be loaded from remote CAR files.
This tests the application at scale, at the price of having stale data formats if they have changed.

Once have fake data working at scale, import the live data.
