Where to cut an Idea into two Ideas, or where to combine is a difficult thing to decide.  The higher the cost of these operations, the worse it will deviate from ideal.

If the clumping was the viewers choice, and internally each atom of knowledge was treated as independent, then this cost becomes zero.

Then we could mark sentences with being a problem or a solution and have free rolling clumps of problems that have solutions target them, where those solutions present more problems, and so on.

Each atom could be rated too, so viewing a particular 'page' would be more like viewing a certain threshold of rating.
