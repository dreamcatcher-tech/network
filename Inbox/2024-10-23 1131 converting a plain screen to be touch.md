Use the ultraleap2 motion controller, which is about $220USD, then use that to do hand tracking so we can select things on screen.

Tap is picked up by vibration sensors, and if the hand is close enough to the screen and a bump is felt, then do a touch event at that location.

If the leap motion could be used as a keyboard, then keyboard can have all its complexity removed, and it is simply a shaped thing that you hit with your fingers, and the leap says which finger ?

Makes it ultra transportable.
