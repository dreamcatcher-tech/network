Each user has a chain that is separate from github.

This is their home chain.

Calls to ask git to do things go via this system.

There is a new branch for every session they start.

These can be considered the place that pierces come from, so hopefully in the future git repos won't be pierced, they will be interchained.

If user actions only come in on these specific chains, then we can easily store the ulids or do some client side formula to ensure there is never double delivery of messages.
