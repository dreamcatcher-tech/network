If we could use AI to handle the remdediation of faults, then we could run a mailserver without the headache, that would be raw on the wire, very cost effective, and our fate would be our own.

Filtering and other things would be AI powered, and we could sell that as a service.

By buying addresses, we could let people run their own servers.

Certainly seems simpler to get started with, rather than integrating with AWS.

Stucks and config changes would be managed by an agent.

We would auto dig thru the problems, and users could see us looking in to things, and see the steps we are taking.

Normally when email stops, the users are at a loss, so there may be good gains at running on the wire, since we are able to fix anything, and they can watch us.

They can see when the problem escalates up to a human, and they can have the joy of seeing how impactful the fault they found was.
