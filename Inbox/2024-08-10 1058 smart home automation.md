Jack in to the garage opener.
Have a simple camera that can do some basic things like motion detection.  Has a battery.
When an event occurs, run thru higher level vision models.
Hopefully recognize individual people.
Combine channels of awareness, like whose phone is on wifi and for how long and has it been active.

Then people with authority can ask for things, and it runs thru some safety checks, like checking the camera is clear of obstructions, checking nobody is nearby, no animals or anything like that.

Might have extra requirement that the gates are shut when the garage opens.

In this way, the whole home can be controlled intelligently, with a chat interface.

Also stats about data can be easily inferred, and other tools can be brought to bear, like analysis tooling.
