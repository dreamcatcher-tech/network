After scraping the page, we should break it into selectable sections so that user can indicate what parts should be processed further, saved as snippets, used to build up ideas, etc.

The browsing should be inside our app, with the rendered page being handled far away, so it is captured and recorded and repeatable, and strained of all adds and other info not relevant to the task at hand - it is semantic focus.
