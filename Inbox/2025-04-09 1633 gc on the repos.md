We would begin a long-running process that would start from the soul tip, walking the repo and marking all of the objects that each commit referred to. Once I had completed this pass, it would then walk all the objects in the repo that were younger than the head that it was working from and it would delete anything that it didn't find in its map. 

This would cover things like deleted branches.

BUT it would mean that some previous states of the soul branch could not be recreated ?

So instead, should we walk the soul branch, and then walk all the commits that it records, so we cover deleted branches too ?

How could we then do deletions or compressions of history ?
