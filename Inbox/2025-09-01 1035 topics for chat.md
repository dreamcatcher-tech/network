so you start the agent, then dynamically select the face you want to start ?
bothered about the amount of fly specific stuff - it is definitely affecting our design.

where to now ?

1. multi agent
2. standard format for the config files
3. git repos

but actually
1. auth
2. nfs
3. multi agent (with config files) 

and then...
1. computer to computer communication
