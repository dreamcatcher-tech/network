agents seems to be all about faces ?
so you start the agent, then dynamically select the face you want to start ?
so that config file seems all about the agent ?
bothered about the amount of fly specific stuff - it is definitely affecting our design.

where to now ?

1. multi agent
2. standard format for the config files
3. git repos
