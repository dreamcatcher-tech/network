Take in emails or whatsapp messages, or any other messaging apps including SMS.  GPT should calculate what the customer infers, if they are legitimate, if the customer is in distress and needs personal attention.  If we take this approach, we can avoid the customer portal completely, since it removes the need for a separate piece of software to be maintained, no authorization loops for customers to go thru, no help for the customer required.

New customer can be either a prepopulated email, or a chat message.

Inside the app, these are all inducted, as well as the comms method which is used for verification.  

Can use the existing mailbox information as training data.  Present proposed changes to a human to quickly read and approve.

The closer to realtime the entire org acts, the deeper the connection to the customers.  As soon as there is a time delay, the essence is lost.  The CEO should be able to receive a notification in realtime of a call from a customer that they should be a part of, and they should respond before the call ends.  They should then be able to alter the course / ruleset / programming of the org and immediately set off in the new direction.

This model can be used for any email heavy business where we can provide them a system that automatically responds to emails, and learns from their supervisor auditing something and telling them what the reasoning behind their mistake was.  They can discuss with the supervisor and prove their reasoning if they have been given inconsistent instructions.

Phone calls can be auto interpreted, and the receiver prompted with information.  If the responder is not following the script, a warning kicks up to a supervisor.  The changes the customer wants are presented to the responder for approval.

Can ask for signup by people leaving a voicemail message.  We store the number they called from along with the message.  We propose the changes we think they want in the system.

Because of the labour savings, this seems more lucrative than blockchain alone, or more than making software quickly to respond to changing staff needs.  It is a result of less software, with more structured internals.

This same ability could be used on drivers out in the field who can take voice notes, and can simply talk to the system that responds back with text inputs they want to make.

Generalize the sale of the system and keep access to company data by paying the companies a fair recompense for using their data for training on, plus rewarding early adopters.

We could attach a customers account status to the bottom of every email we send back to them - next collection, balance, next payment due.

Could we then connect together these basic services to present compound services.
