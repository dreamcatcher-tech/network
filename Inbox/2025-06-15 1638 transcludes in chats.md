separate from doing transcludes as network comms, this is about doing transcludes in a chat.

? where would the transclude go ?
? is it a special piece of git data that can reference internal git object addressing ?

? will the transcludes be filled in with the backing data, or will they be just pointers ?

? how can permissions be used ? if the creator of the transclude has permissions, and their transclude permissions are set to expand beyond their own access ? or you can set transclude permissions separately.

ideally we want a reasoning system that can be asked these questions, can think thru options that make good answers, then a human add to the knowledge base by selecting which one makes sense and why.
