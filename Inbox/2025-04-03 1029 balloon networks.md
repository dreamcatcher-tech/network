If a mesh of high-altitude balloons was used to form a data mesh between themselves, they could also push this data down to lower drones using lasers. Taking advantage of the fact that the drone can be completely shielded from anything coming from the ground, and so to jam laser signals coming from a high altitude facing nearly directly down, the jamming becomes very difficult to achieve. You almost need to jam at the source. Jamming at source I believe will be hard because the atmosphere will attenuate anything coming up. And the amount of energy required to disable the transmitter is significantly more than the power that the transmitter can resist and still function. 

Might be able to power them from lasers on the ground.

May use them as mirrors to point a high powered beam at a drone down below, saving weight on equipment in the drone, and providing no delay in signal.
