we need to make a big repo that has polished versions of the agents that can be selected and discovered and used as starting points for getting work done.

this should present as a git repo and you can browse it checked out, or a dedicated agent can spin up that has access to this library.

a shared agent could be present that everyone can talk to and make queries against, as a public good.  This mcp face can be used to discover agents.  then you pull down the image and run it as one of your agents.

have some trusted agents that we have hand curated.
