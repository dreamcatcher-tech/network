the workspace gets laid out, then the agent config gets laid out.
workspace is a collection of git repos that may be private or shared.

agent config is in a fiber folder - a little folder that contains data specific to the agent execution.

it would be config relevant to the agent itself, like the agent.toml, the codex config files.
