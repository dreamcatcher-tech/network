>[!question] Targets: 

>[!danger] Depends: 

needs to have a down and up channel, so that the chain it runs can communicate with it, like for changing the validator set.

needs a protocol upgrade point, where at a prearranged point, everyone will upgrade.

needs to do byzantine reporting.
error on duplicate content with a different hash, or a message number incrementing.
This number should be a ulid ? so that if the node loses its memory, it can recover ?
if it loses memory, it has to wait, in case it is acting byzantine.

needs a version number in the protocol of each message.

each agreement needs to point at the prior hash that was agreed upon.

could allow one node to rip ahead and propose many different sequences, with each subsequent round referencing the first ?

each function call should be given a seed parameter to, to generate randomness from.  It might choose to generate a random order of broadcast messages to send to different nodes in different orders.
