Use the filerunner to run a test suite that does the full loop.

- set up a sandbox environment
- edit an agent file
- run the agent file with the changed contents in a remote thread
- escape out to the base thread
- tell the test controller to run the tests on the given branch
- base thread then use the test results to modify the agent file
- rerun the tests
- merge the modified agent file up to the sandbox parent directory


But then how to view the file contents in all the different branches ?
Need to see children, even tho those children have closed.

Need to see full git repos, so we can debug their performance after they have run.
