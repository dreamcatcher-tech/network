We should be able to grind thru all the docs, generate snippets that we can use for embeddings, and then we should be able to receive requests and questions from people, and if they are deemed good questions, we should be able to improve our knowledge base.

The first pass gives some questions, then as the human digs deeper, we can learn more about what the person wants to do.  THis can improve things for everyone.  As those improvements are utilized, the early contributors are rewarded for it.  This makes our intelligence better and more saleable, and earns something for the contributor.

These are collective intelligence models, and all AIs are a form of collective intelligence, but only some reward back to all who contributed to it.  There can be only one that rewards back based on AI fairness where the aim is the ultimate fairness.
