Current hardware construction is like C code - no package manager - we should make a CAD system that is package aware, and can allow imports of well defined parts with FEA testing.

Be able to sell software defined hardware components, including testing, mfg alteratives.

CAD components can be imported with same npm like ratings as software components.
Interface definitions included, same as TS typings.

Request system for components that are not built yet.  Interfaces make it possible to build drop in replacements and automatically test their suitability.  So when supply chains crunch, can automatically switch out parts and know they will work.

Gather operating data on the components.  Construct all components in this way, not just high performance teams, but this is the way that any tech construction should occur.  Software to control the components can then be written for the virtual model, and testing done against real sampling.
