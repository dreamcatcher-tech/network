if you connect to a remote repo, then you are linked to it, and you connect and interact with the instance of the repo directly.

But if you want to track it, or keep a clone of it, then you would need to set up your own consensus branch, and keep in sync with the body of the remote ?

We could track the commits of the remote consensus branch, so that we can see what they see, but can also have our own views on it ?

This could be used in consensus views, where the tip of our branch includes what we know about the tips of the others ?

The justifications in casper might be just commits, since those commits include our view of what all the others said, so our own message justifies itself ?
