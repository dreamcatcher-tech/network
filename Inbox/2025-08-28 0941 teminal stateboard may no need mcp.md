if the bot can enter straight terminal commands, then it might not need mcp tooling under the hood ?

mcp makes it very much more likely that the bot will make the right decisions.

This is really the key of baked code - bots labour and make wrong decisions and work out their own flop, their own tastes, then they back that into a small pack of limited functions so that the chance of making a mistake is near zero.
