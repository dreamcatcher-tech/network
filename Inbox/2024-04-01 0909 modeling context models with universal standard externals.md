Be able to model any money making scheme and show where the external money is coming in to the system from.  Internal loops are a form of ponzi.

Some external models tap the environment in detrimental ways.

So we can classify opportunities as internal (flawed), negative environment, positive environment.

It may be that positive is hard to find, and in the meantime, we have systems that are less negative.
