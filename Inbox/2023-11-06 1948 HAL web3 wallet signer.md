Using an extension to manage keys, HAL should be able to sign anything you like.

Can hold the signing keys inside the web page only, since only required inside HAL.

Could HAL load other webpages inside an iFrame and then manipulate them, like navigating binance page to guide you thru doing things ?  Use an extension to allow HAL to drive a page that is not from the same origin.
