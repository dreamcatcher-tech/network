The main app window should treat the stateboard like a browser and record all the navigation actions that occured.  This means the agent can drive, or you can drive too. Our widgets are just those that are aware they are being driven, but any page can be put on this anvil.

when you first arrive at an org page, they can let you chat with their agent, where they pay your tokens, or you can sign in and come in with your own agent.

The chat can have filter tools and settings.

Key is if we can have these options be reasoned about by the bot, then we can use logic and feedback to guide how the ui should be.  Each choice can then be justified logically.

Operator agents can review the ui under different metrics, like difficulty to do any particular action, generating head maps, and measuring distance travelled to do different things.

Every item in the chat history should have the ability to pick a different version of what it was and to roll back to that point. If you take an action that would change the history of the chat at some given point, you've now created a fork. This is displayed in the chat view box as a series of branches or a tree that looks like a file explorer view. It shows you places where the chat has diverged, and when you click on them, you can bring each one up in the chat viewer. 

Although changing the chat history that led you to the widget that allowed you to recall these past histories might be quite jarring because you could easily get lost, and then how would you bring back your previous chat that you were on? It's almost like a different kind of viewer needs to be shown and in something like a restore button. 

In the chat list, if you switch between different widgets, it shouldn't make any kind of difference. Like it should only change or update the latest view in the chat. There's no point showing just what you looked at until you actually took some action. When you take an action that would show up as a nested item to indicate some type of right that occurred to the data set. 

Each widget in the chat history should also be able to indicate that it represents a snapshot or not the latest thing. So when you click on it, you should see that it represents a snapshot and you should see the results at that snapshot. The title bar that is common to all widgets should indicate that you are not at the latest, give you the ability to diff with latest or some other thing, and give you other historical controls. 

I think what we're saying is that all your chats are always part of your home repo. But I'm just not sure if chats should be part of other repos, it's just the point of a chat is that it goes all across all the repos, just like you do, just like a person does.
