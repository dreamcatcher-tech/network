The main app window should treat the stateboard like a browser and record all the navigation actions that occured.  This means the agent can drive, or you can drive too. Our widgets are just those that are aware they are being driven, but any page can be put on this anvil.

when you first arrive at an org page, they can let you chat with their agent, where they pay your tokens, or you can sign in and come in with your own agent.

The chat can have filter tools and settings.

Key is if we can have these options be reasoned about by the bot, then we can use logic and feedback to guide how the ui should be.  Each choice can then be justified logically.

Operator agents can review the ui under different metrics, like difficulty to do any particular action, generating head maps, and measuring distance travelled to do different things.
