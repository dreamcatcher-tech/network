If a public DHT was set up where a repoId can be entered, then this is the lookup table for figuring out who is paying.

So there must be an entry in this table, else the item must pay for itself.

This is better than letting the repo say who is paying, since it stops spam requests where the repo just claims someone else is paying, it is payer says, so the payers are responsible for stating that they will pay.  

It is better because who is paying can be updated without any change to the target repo, and it does not require permission to pay if someone wants to do that.  If the repo allows it, you don't even need or get read info from the repo in order to pay for its activities.

The registry can be shared between multiple hosting providers.

Consumption of payment always leaves a records which is a tradeable NFT.

Make it so that only hosters can read from it, but anyone can write to it.

If you overwrite and entry, you are sharing the costs ?

A private repo requires permissions control to be allowed to pay for it, since its gas usage leaks info about it.
Repos can accept funding from anyone, or noone.

Because storage is forever, people can just retract their payment offers from the table and the repo becomes user pays / someone else pays.
