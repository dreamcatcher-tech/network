As the fight continues for AI supremacy, and prompting becomes coveted, the ability to be guaranteed to at least be recorded for doing something first becomes important.

When things change so quickly that a week is a long time, being able to claim first in the world is important.

So making dNFTs that represent what the prompt inputs you are supplying is important.  Basically prompt first, generate NFTs each prompt, then submit to whatever LLM you need.  Proof of being first and what the innovation you brought is important.

The importance is amplified once we release the first attribution system that looks at this firstness / novelty and starts to pay out to it.  This will draw people in to use the system more, since if you aren't registered, then its hard to prove what you are owed.

Once we see some usage, we can do our own rollups in the GPU chain.

Represent an idea as a string of prompts and responses, and then auto generate images based on it.
