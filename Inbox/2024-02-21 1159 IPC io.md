Need a separate set of io objects that track requests that were sent out from this chain to other chains.  Before making the requests, we need to commit them.  They would be stored in a trail, which is the execution of a single incoming request, and all the request replies related to them.

So outgoing is just another IoStruct that commits all the requests we made out, and the replies that came back.  Replies might be left as the remote branch, and we would need to look that up to replay it, rather than copying into the channel ?  Seems easier just to copy it in.

If we have serial request processing, 

We have serial request processing since repeatability with filesystem interactions is impossible during concurrent execution.

? could these be done in a branch with a special relationship ?  like the fs control is handed to this branch so it will guaranteed fast forward upon return ?

If we give it a full loop around the event loop, then we know we grabbed everything.
The executor will try stick around, but can be restarted.

Needs to have a recovery plan too.
