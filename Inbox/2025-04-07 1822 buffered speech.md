sender to revise unread messages. 

if the recipient has not heard your message, you have the ability to revise it. The edit will be visible. If you realize that you may have said something that didn't need to be said after you got more information, you can always have it erased. Also, if you turn it on, your AI will attempt to collapse and condense the messages that you're trying to get across. To do this type of de-duplication on your behalf.
