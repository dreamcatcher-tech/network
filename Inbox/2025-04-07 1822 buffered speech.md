sender to revise unread messages. 

if the recipient has not heard your message, you have the ability to revise it. The edit will be visible. If you realize that you may have said something that didn't need to be said after you got more information, you can always have it erased. Also, if you turn it on, your AI will attempt to collapse and condense the messages that you're trying to get across. To do this type of de-duplication on your behalf. 

The catch-up time for speech, even if it was genuine audio, could be incredibly fast if all the 'ums', the 'ahs', and any duplications were removed. Furthermore, if a text-based summary was provided and then the word-sprit type of flashing text in front of your eyes could be delivered. So if the actual text was translated by the AI to make it more consumable in this rapid burst, then you could catch up on an incredible amount of information and people might not even notice that you had gone missing momentarily.
