list machines returns all the metadata too.
the metadata includes the parent child relationships.

We pull the list all at once, so we need to see the full snapshot, so no need to make it reverse lookable.

we list machines and make machines.

test it with mocks, and then test it with an actual AI that has access to these functions ?

or, test it with an mcp server that is exposed on the agent, that we can connect to ?

We can expose a port, just for testing, to connect the mcp inspector to?

if we just get some basic agent lifecycle operations going, then we fatten it with custom instructions.

get the basic browser router concept going, then fatten it with navigation, handovers, and the concierge.
