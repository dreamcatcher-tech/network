If we took each action and stripped off its envelope signatures, then it would mean that it could be stored in an object that could be de-duplicated. Otherwise, the insertion of the nuts and other entropy like the signature means that it cannot possibly be de-duplicated. 

So if we store it just as the signature signer sees it, then that is good, and the signatures can come separately and just be held in I guess independent little objects or maybe one big file. Or have some sort of compression that runs on them periodically to squash them down as a one object. 

If there were many actions at a time, then we could sign them all by way of attaching a single proof. 

Hereâ€™s a good idea: 

If the signature for the action also points to the previous action that was received, then we can throw away each prior signature because the current signature points to all the others. Now it can point to many in parallel; they need not be a linear sequence per se. 

The action itself can use the hash of the object in GET, as the thing that gets signed, and so it is transmitted as an object and only signed out of band or at a high level in a different plane. 

Furthermore, we could set the action format to be a Git tree, and then this means the files piece is much easier. I guess it becomes inefficient though, but it could be just a blob that holds all the config information and then a tree that holds all the file's information, and then the signature goes on the blob as a whole. 

What's good about that is that it means all the actions are naturally browsable, so the same way you browse data files is the same way that you browse the config and events files. You don't need a special decoder to understand what's happening inside them. 

Further space could be saved by making the nonce be in the file name of the action, so that's even higher up. 

The amount of hashing and data storage is still pretty much exactly the same. It's just got better alignment with the rest of the system. There's no special boundary jump where we have to take the files and treat them like a Git object. It's just literally a folder on the disk, and that is what represents the action. 

The channel of actions coming in from any other repo can be just simply a sharded folder where the names of the repo of the actions are simply their order of arrival.  Then when new actions come in, this is simply a Git patch, and so we only need to sign the commit that holds the folder. The size is unlimited because of the sharding, and it's also browsable by the other tools. As well, when files are being passed around with actions, they are first-class kit objects and so can be browsed as such.

How would transclusions work in Git? There is no data structure within Git that can point to another Git object. We would have to parse the git structure in the same way as git annexed us. There are two options for doing transclusion:

1. The full fat link can be in each document in a format that gets resolved
2. The transclusion links in the document point to a standard folder in the repo or branch that has the full fat transclusions and any transformations

A transclusion becomes a pointer to a range of bytes and some kind of transform optionally. They can also be pointed to as reference or induction or retrieval.

The transclusions can actually be seen as a form of rag or citations or annotations that were used in the generation by the AI. The AI should generate these automatically, but humans can have some assistance to generate what the references actually were based on their browser history or based on the bot finding similarities.
