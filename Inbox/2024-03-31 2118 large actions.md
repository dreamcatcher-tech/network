If an action has binary attached, then it goes into B2 as an object before getting pooled.
Ensure garbage collection doesn't pull that in.

If an action has json that is oversize, convert to a B2 object and use this as part of the pooling process ?

Pool would need to expire in this case, to avoid dangling pieces in the B2 store.
