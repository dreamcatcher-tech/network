If we can run a simple model decentralized, then we can use central models with the decent model being the judger.

So the latest closed models, or api calls can be treated like external oracles, or like humans, and then the centralized model chooses.

So long as its judgement of what is better or worse is good, that is all we need.

If we make it so that the model is forced to put its decisions into a fixed format, like a rubric, and then push a button on a calculator, rather than relying on the inference to make the decision.

harnesses that thing that we never see errors in summarizing, or transforming tasks.
