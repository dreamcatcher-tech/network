Calculating exactly what the attribution will be might be too tough, however if an AI was trained and modified slightly each run, then it can be said to be the statistical output of all the actions, and so if asked, can give a reasonable result ?

The result could also be weighted to try to understand the complexity or skill required for the code in question.
