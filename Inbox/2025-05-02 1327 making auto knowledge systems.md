The theory is that for any given company, their knowledge expertise could probably be roughly determined by parsing their email server. If we develop a system that could go through and distill down all the email knowledge separated into unanswered questions, answers that are unanimous and answers that are conflicted, then we could get authoritative answers or decisions about the items that are inconclusive from reading the emails. At the end, you have this knowledge system that is authoritative and it can answer any question to any person about the company's specific knowledge. As it continues to run, these types of needs for authoritative answers can be surfaced continually and we can get greater value out of the answers that the people who know give us. At the start, even just on day one, it's still doing pretty good.

Once you have this knowledge base, you can set it as a gateway to parse all emails going out to make sure that they match what the knowledge base knows, and if they don't, then it's a reason for a question to be asked of someone authoritative. It can also help you write an email on the spot that skirts around the things that you don't know for sure.

This system should be extended to cover real-time knowledge such as the status of some shipping or other types of in-flight data so that it always has the most up-to-date results. When you ask it things, it should be able to provide references to the back-end management systems and tracking systems, and even external tracking systems or in emails that have been received. When you ask questions, if it doesn't know, it should be able to draft an email and get ready to send it out to find out for you and manage the communication with other people so that it can get its answers from people.
