The framework we have allows the production system to be instantly and lightly forked, and arbitrary actions dispatched against this fork, with the output being calculated.

In a conventional system, this is not possible to do, since there are only the real production actions that can be taken.

So allowing a way to try something with no side effects, consider the output, and try something different is perfect for AI systems who need to experiment a little to get things right.

We can also present a batch of changes to a human for final consideration.

So if you expose the whole chain to an AI, and a way for it to play until it is confident it has a set of actions that match its users desires, then you can make an interface to your app that is AI controlled, and likely very accurate.
