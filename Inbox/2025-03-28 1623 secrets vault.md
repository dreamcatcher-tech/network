When an operation needs something secret, the hosting system should insert it at the last possible minute.  

So an API call, would go thru the secrets injector, with instructions on what to inject.

This could be used for customer records, or other types of data, so that customer names are treated as secrets, as well as their emails.
Access to these credentials is logged all the time, and is subject to rate limits, to stop data exfiltration.
