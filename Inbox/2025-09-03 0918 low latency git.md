we could run our own git server, and treat it like a data store, so we can at least play with the experience of running these bots.

artifact then, becomes nothing more than the model of how to control the containers, pack their state down in git, and manage their IPC.

Dreamcatcher becomes the marketplace where the resources to run artifact gets traded, and innovations upon artifact, dreamcatcher, and anything else are discovered and financed.

the performance of git in an agent compute design becomes more our concern, but we can avoid that perf tuning until a later date.

tucking the git meta data state into git itself seems fairly easy using the command line anyway.
