## Notes

After chatting with Rod, the follow next steps arise:
Two major areas of pain are:
1. ETL processes required for consolidated reporting
2. System integration between software systems.

Make a base connector to PowerBI so the bus can be dropped in immediately.

Make a system bus that goes in to a company.
API mapper that wraps each system with its API functions and provides a dictionary to other systems or to a standard format.
Making the bus come with a store and a marketplace for services

A graphical tool to map out the systems in an org.  Show all the systems and their connectivity strengths to each other.
Map out manual processes too.

Impact marketplace / toolbox.
Services marketplace where the mapping tool also includes each individual computer, and th
Show the bus topology shifting over time.
Plan the tranformations based on bus topology.
Show other people with similar topologies.
Cost of each component, and the API calls that they are capable of.
Show the usage of the actual APIs so can score the cross section.

There are pillars in a company, like sales, financial, data governance.
Model people in an org as connected to systems in the topology.

Connect to Xero, and extract the cost of each topology piece so can know how much each is costing and how much it should cost.  Allow a shared database

Publish your own connectivity topology, billing per month, usage / calls, integration maps, integration desires.

## Integrations marketplace
Wrappers around systems describing their api in standard terms.
Hooks / functions / triggers, but also the models of the data inside the systems and mappings between them.  This should be able to be filled in by a low skilled person, and then automatically tested to ensure connectivity with the target system.

## Topology tool
The topology tool should be able to show systems, and people, and individual machines.
Use this tool without having the bus installed.  Show topology mesh ratings, and how they are missing some connections.

## OpenIT
IT services provide a stable baseline to enable a marketplace of services.  Stop bundling the whole IT projects along
