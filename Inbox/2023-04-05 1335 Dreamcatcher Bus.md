## Situation
We have a blockchain based system that we want to develop into a service bus for connecting business systems together.  This bus would include processing capability, and would form and installation target for making bus native systems.  An appstore would supply these applications, and requests for applications would be gathered by a bus application that was part of the base installation.  A services marketplace would allow purchasing services for construction and maintenance of the bus.  The software would be open source avoiding any form of vendor lockin.

An active bus which is capable of computation as well as data storage and transmission allows a surround and absorb pattern to unfold, where blackbox systems are gradually replaced by open bus native systems.

If an org cares about impact, then they generally want to publicize their high moral stance, and they will want ethical treatment thruout their supply chains - this means that the software and marketplaces will eventually be paid by them, negating the need for closed source lockin model software.

## Subsystems
1. Publication of digital topology and costings as an advertisement for services
2. a system bus as an integration baseline.
3. cloud connector services to regain control of cloud based data
4. an appstore for products that plug into the bus
5. a services marketplace for bus related things

Ultimately, if a group of companies can implement this bus, then cross company applications can be deployed that will enable generalized goods and services trade in a purely digital manner.  Revenue thru is revenue earned, providing a source of funding to build out more of the bus ecosystem.

## Cloud connector
Disaster recovery should be held to a single standard across the company - leaving it up to each individual SaaS vendor will eventually lead to irreparable loss.  Each time new data processing is required, a new connector is made, but if there was already a standard model, this new data can be done in a low code fashion.

Org can be more offline tolerant and remote offices or workers can tolerate lower grade connections such as cellphone hotspots or hotel wifi.  Org can be taken on a plane ride and still operate and queue up writes.

## Bus MVP

Root bus - a global bus that contains the top level appstore.
App store with some applications including sample impact reports, topology tool.
Mock integrated systems, or a genuine xero integration, like Xero to email or something.
Request board / api marketplace mock up
Services marketplace

## Notes

If the public chain acted as a bus between blockchains, then that same bus can be between any other conventional system on the net too.

Bus goes in to a company first, like a database does, then things get installed on the top.  Some of the things installed can also manage nodes in the fabric.

API sync calls can be made using a swarm of

Wrap systems in our standardization, and then allow translations to standard models that are interchangeable.  If we wrapped Raytio, then we could test our use as a bus connector.
Bus makes connection between internal systems easier, but intercompany, the same bus can make system connections easier again.
We should be able to map out topological connections between multiple companies as well as internally.  A intercompany bus.

CRM as a bus native application.

Bridge between multiple cloud based system.  View communication between those systems, take backups.
Host the bus, support it, migrate it, take it offline.

Tool to map out what the api of a system looks like, and do it so that it can be automatically tested against that system.  Sniff much of it from actual api calls.

If IT services became more a marketplace than a closed competition, we can make progress.  From that progress, we can extract revenue.

Carbon cost reporting can be instantly extracted from their spend.  Basic reports on environmental impact can be generated from the bus.


After chatting with Rod, the follow next steps arise:
Two major areas of pain are:
1. ETL processes required for consolidated reporting
2. System integration between software systems.

These two problems can be solved at once using a enterprise service bus.  Further, sometimes the systems to be integrated are cloud services, so this bus must be cloud native.

Make a base connector to PowerBI so the bus can be dropped in immediately.

Make a system bus that goes in to a company.
Value point is as soon as the company wants consolidated reporting, as the bus installation would be simpler, cheaper, has more connectivity options.
Deployment is currently $5k - $10k for the sql database and data integration pieces.  Then on top is about $500 per report.
API mapper that wraps each system with its API functions and provides a dictionary to other systems or to a standard format.
Making the bus come with a store and a marketplace for services

A graphical tool to map out the systems in an org.  Show all the systems and their connectivity strengths to each other.
Map out manual processes too.

Impact marketplace / toolbox.
Services marketplace where the mapping tool also includes each individual computer, and th
Show the bus topology shifting over time.
Plan the tranformations based on bus topology.
Show other people with similar topologies.
Cost of each component, and the API calls that they are capable of.
Show the usage of the actual APIs so can score the cross section.

There are pillars in a company, like sales, financial, data governance.
Model people in an org as connected to systems in the topology.

Connect to Xero, and extract the cost of each topology piece so can know how much each is costing and how much it should cost.  Allow a shared database

Publish your own connectivity topology, billing per month, usage / calls, integration maps, integration desires.  Open publishing and deduplication of requirements.

Syncing and backing up data in cloud based systems.  Configure the frequency of sync if it is polling based.  Triggers into other systems can be formed in this way.

reconciliation between actions requested from the bus and the synchronized state.  Can know when some actions will trigger changes so we should immediately patch the model we have of the system.  We can do lock management to allow only one api call to be operating concurrently.

Shatterable bus - the bus can be broken apart and recombined, as faults are highly tolerable - expected as part of normal operations.

ML that can detect what the workflows are given the data.

## Integrations work
Map out what companies are currently paying for integrations between difference systems

## Process management
The bus should be able to detect when a process is taking place, and connect multiple system data interactions together in a common thread.

## Integrations marketplace
Wrappers around systems describing their api in standard terms.
Hooks / functions / triggers, but also the models of the data inside the systems and mappings between them.  This should be able to be filled in by a low skilled person, and then automatically tested to ensure connectivity with the target system.

## Topology tool
The topology tool should be able to show systems, and people, and individual machines.
Use this tool without having the bus installed.  Show topology mesh ratings, and how they are missing some connections.

Summarize multiple instances of company to view the overall systems connectivity graph.  Shows how many times a given system connects to another one, and how much is being paid for that integration.

This tool would be made publicly available for anyone to use, and if they want more help they can jump off from there using their data as a baseline.

## OpenIT
IT services provide a stable baseline to enable a marketplace of services.  Stop bundling the whole IT projects along
