Being able to run my code and lambda boxes in parallel as much as I want. Paying only for the lambda time that I consume with no HAL time being accrued. This seems a far more powerful proposition than having a dedicated development box. I guess the downside is the provisioning of the environment is a little more restricted. But if the lambda functions are the thing that is going to be consumed by the finished product anyway, then it does make sense to introduce this early on. I should be able to get a development experience that is much faster than my existing experience. It should be able to be controlled by an AI, where it can be run in large parallel numbers as required for the AI to experiment with. Then all the while it stops and costs nothing. And plus a lot of the run history is preserved and can be navigated through as required or just discarded as simply part of the process of making software.
