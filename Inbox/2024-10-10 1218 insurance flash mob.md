Using AI to broker definitions and rules for events, we could rapidly propose insurance bets to a market so that people could get insurance for very brief things and the insurer would be an AI that calculated the risk and went ahead and bet for it.

We would need a top level regulator that just assured there were enough funds to cover all who were at risk, and that the depletion rate would allow the insured to get fair warning.

So wouldn't be insuring an event where every covered person could claim all at once.

So if these common pitfalls were being met, then we could allow the bet to be taken by anyone, for any reason.  It would require depositing funds so you are provably covered.

Then the AI would be in charge of settling disputes, like a QA judge - this is an independent service that is offered at different price points, and goes in to the insurance offer.

Can brek down the verification step into some kind of travel component, photos, or other forms of proof.

Store a history of the claims.

Pay extra if want to keep it private, since nobody can learn from that.

The platform would be the one in charge of ensuring the rules were met, and possibly dealing with the regulator to ensure the model was fair.

eg: when a big storm comes, insurance rates can go up, but they stay low otherwise, so people can choose to avoid storm cover, or can take action to mitigate their storm risk, like boarding up windows and other things.

eg: if you left town during the storm, then you shouldn't pay the insurance surge.

Unbundle insurance, so there is a comparator agent that goes around cataloging your stuff and assessing the risk, then it purchases insurance in a marketplace of regulated insurance providers.  The agent is independent and works for you, and the marketplace is a combination of scraped conventional suppliers, and native AI suppliers.  The AI suppliers will likely win since they can respond quicker, and more intricately than conventional.
