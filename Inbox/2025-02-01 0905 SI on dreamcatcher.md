If we make a tool to do NFT conversions, then we can get people to log in to dreamcatcher platform, then use the tool.

We can make a specific satoshi landing page, but people can also set up their own base pages.

But basically we need a platform account, and we should allow you to do other things with that account.

Ingest the whole discord chat history, so you can talk about it.  Bots can relay messages, but we need to move everyone onto platform.
