if we use a service that lets us connect to a wide range of media options, then this agent becomes broadly integratable into whatever workflows people already have.

the key business notion is that we integrate at the level of the people in the org - so it has its own email address, phone number, it can join group chats and messages, etc.

so we should make this basic header function, which translates any of these medias into an mcp compatible stream, so it can enter blockchain land.

we would charge based on joining a meeting and on the transcription time used.

then bot can communicate with our platform fabric for inference, retrieval, and app based integrations in the system.

basically a jack point for the human level comms that are not currently easily joined in.
