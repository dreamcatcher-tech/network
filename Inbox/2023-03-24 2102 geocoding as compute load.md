Geocoders need quite a large instance to be able to run usefully.
They need good uptime, and low latency, so need to be distributed round the globe.
There are many open source examples which can be used to build from.

Converting to run on blockchain should be straightforwards.
Can be put in the API shop to indicate what parts of the service need improvement.
Offers caching and optionally sharing - like the leaflet of geocoding.
Proxy between private services you pay allows you to share your service experience data, whilst keeping the results confidential.
Being able to switch easily since we standardize everyones interfaces means less leverage from the providers.
Because all APIs seek to be as simple and useful as possible, we can always make a central translator that can enable switching between them all easily.

Allow locking request keys to a specific origin domain, so keys cannot be scraped.

Make an inverted model of the earth - cut up the world into cells, with each one having a blockchain.  Let anyone attach data to these cells.  Weakly gather info in dht style walking.  Connect to [[Intents]]

Build up search indexes which charge a fee and make searching quick, whilst boosting data from intermittent lifters.

This geocoding load offers a way to supply your own compute resource to earn credits whilst getting uptime and resilience and software patching from the swarm of others like you - so you aren't paying in cash, but paying in resources, and providing your users with priority service, locally, when you are available.

Good as load since it has a stateful component to it as well, has large datasets that are hard for normal machines to use, commonly charged for, high uptime requirements.
