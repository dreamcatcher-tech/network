We could make a version of Mic'd Up that didn't have the asymmetry between the broadcasters and the speakers. This would mean that anyone can be a speaker.

People can choose to catch up on conversations that other people have had by playing in the audio either at a faster pace or getting a summary. It allows you to have a meeting where it would be the same as if everyone listened until each person had finished talking rather than jumping in, leaving a very good record of what was said.

It also allows each individual to interact with an LLM both personally and in the group as a whole where the LLM acts like a chairperson that reconciles different ideas and can suggest for different people to talk to other people at the table based on conflicting ideas or other interests.

It will be interesting to see what level of size these kinds of meetings could run at because it should make it easier than talking directly to just one other person (but actually it's a group) and everyone can get on the same page rapidly.

It uses an interesting trick to defer time where when you're speaking you speak until you're finished. The other person is free to stop listening and say a response and then catch up on what you said later. Both of you are subject to an LLM interpretation which can summarize the facts in a way that people coming in much later can get a more concise view in a very compact form. 

So I guess what Mic'd Up tried to do was provide the experience of a direct peer-to-peer conversation, although the scale of the communication made it traditionally a broadcast event.

Because very famous people don't have the time to talk to each and every one of the participants, using technology that experience can be passed on and each person can appear to be or sound to be the best possible version of themselves when they are doing it.
