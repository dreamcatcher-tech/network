Be able to make a jitter that lets you experiment with a range of different prompts and goals and run them automatically with a UI.

So the jitter would simulate being HAL under many different circumstances.

Also let SM edit the helps so can see how the helps perform, which provides a tight feedback loop.
These can be committed to GH periodically, which should write them out in markdown format, and publish a website of them for easy perusal.
