They need their own files because this is equivalent to three local storage in other languages. It's also equivalent to async local storage in Node.js. So the paradigm seems to be common across languages.

Separately, what should be stored in the base files branch of the Fibers provider? Possibly nothing, but config is what I'm guessing.
