If we allowed for the browsing of individual isolates, then loading a specific command, maybe this would be more use than requiring them to be bundled up into a help ?

In effect, the command is a bare help, where helps are for procedures that require compound commands.

Should have a bot that can list all the commands, and load any given one, then execute them on any PID and if allowed, on any commit.
