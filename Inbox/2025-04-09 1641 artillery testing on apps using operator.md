We can hit with high request load in an automated way, where ai generated how the load would be best suited to hit, removing the need for much work from you, but we can also run an automated operator that will attempt to use your app, and will drill in to what's different, and test it in ways that normal users might.

At the same time, if on artifact, the internal loads would show up.

Plus you can try to do prompt injection to cause the models to beserk.
