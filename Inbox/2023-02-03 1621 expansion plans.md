>[!question] Targets: 

>[!danger] Depends: 

deploy and cut the overheads off the trucking business.
acquire other businesses and immediately turn them profitable.
Modify the software to handle more and more firms as this aquisition expansion continues.

take business functions and bundle them together, like call centre functions.
Sell that function to other unrelated business as a way to expand the software business.

Basically want a software company that takes a cut of the value it provides, rather than a price for the software alone.  By being aware of the value it creates, and being highly adaptive to customer needs, it is well positioned to charge by value, instead of by price.

Its adaptivity will cause it to stay embedded for a very long time.  It being owned by all its participants will ensure it never really goes out of business.

Treat the customer like a dignified person, and present them with easy switchability between suppliers.  Have affinity for a certain service person who can handle their matters access multiple service offerings.

As services get increasingly small, the burden of management is too great for each individual.  Cross cutting services management then becomes a service of its own.  Handles the rough edges using manual interfacing.  Gives people some weight to push back against and demand certain interfaces from difficult to change incumbents.

Taking a company fully offline, and replacing a company entirely with custom software is not an economic task for small to medium businesses.  By proving that can change, we open up vast markets across the globe, as most business is conducted by small to medium sized companies.

## Small Trucking Company
Proof of income - something that a customer values enough to pay for
Proof of framework - prove the framework actually works
Mobile
Intermittent
Full offline
Cheap fast changes
Proof of acquisition payment model

## Acquisition model
Pure capital gains
Register a pubco using catalist or similar in NZ
Capital gains is taxless in NZ
Acquire businesses into the main vehicle, gut them and softwareize them using Dreamcatcher.
Blockchain them, so instant value hit.
Use the pubco stock to acquire more.
Use revenues from these businesses to fortify share price.

## OpenIT
Make an IT company that offers open service models.


## Enabling automated markets
Using tech to make bespoke software that can connect to other pieces of software to form a marketplace for automated trade, then take a portion of that marketplace.
Automated markets th
The software is free, the catch is that we will invite you to offer your goods and services in our marketplace, and encourage you to consume from our marketplace of suppliers.
The marketplace optionally allows for ethics auditing, as provided by the software plus onsite audits, so you can purchase fully ethical goods.
When you move to purchasing ethically, we know that we will eventually get paid for this.

## Selling compute
The primary thing we want to sell is computational load.  Apps and other revenues on top of that are a bonus, but the baseline we want is compute.  This blockchain network is for large scale computation of both general and specialized kinds.  This should be the preferred way to both consume and supply compute resources.  A blockchain future necessitates computation over content addressed systems.

## A Blockchain
Making a public blockchain sounds like the best goal to keep working towards.  Then start hauling load onto it, as well as showing how private deployments are possible.  All private deployments need common services, like emails, Eth chain interactions.

Somewhat makes sense to bind doing something to help SILD at the same time, since benefits residence, showcase site, and investments, to a great receptive audience.

## Public listing
How can capital be raised inside the model of the Dreamcatcher ?  What would the stock be worth ?  Is greater utility found tackling existing blockchain use cases vs traditional software problems ? or both at the same time ?  Can a crypto raise be done out of Vanuatu ?
Wrap stock in objects so we can facilitate an exchange using just the protocol.

## An app building company
List online say we're looking for projects, provide a discounted rate using fixed pricing, no timelines but you can easily see progress, test cases for our blockchain systems.  Invite people to apply for paid work, where we generate packets, and attempt to complete them - no win, no fee.

## Hosting
Having a hosting provider seems essential to any kind of growth, particularly since we need to host publicly accessible dreamcatcher instances, and provide very low barrier to operation for new devs.
Model would be host a static page however you like - ghpages being an easy one.
We will host your chains up to a certain free size and free usage limit.
Outside those limits, or with extended support, you need to pay.  If you want privacy, you have to pay.  New users are a new limit, so their usage is charged separately.  Anyone can pay for anyone elses chain to run on our host.

If you host the software yourself, you should pay, but we have no way to enforce it.
You can run your own host, since our infrastructure software is open too.

We need privacy perservation for this service.
We can make a separate host for each privacy requiring installation, which has limited dial peers.

Use S3 backend and free startup credits to save on costs.
Storage model is forever if paid.  Forever best effort if free.
The longer data goes without being referenced, the deeper it gets persisted, so that decades on data may take up to a week to recover.

Data transfer will incur fees, and up to some limit
Free tier is paid by staking in pools, where money goes in, and
This is how we get back some of the cost of storing free data.

We can implement paid hosting and can ship certed units to remote locations which are public data, so only correctness matters - not privacy.  Users can have some free data, and user accounts are always free ?

Have the high quality AWS grade one, but also the cheap homebuilt hardware running in a garage version. Plus a private custom supported one which guarantees confidentiality.

Later make our own static page host making it ghpages compatible.
Wrap the AWS api in objects so we can control the infrastructure we run on using our own chains.

## Link to Opensea
ERC1155 contract integration that mints new NFTs representing the amount of money that was paid in to an item.  This can only be done for security cleared items, to avoid being a security.
Should have general interface to link 

We can sell software access tokens as NFTs so that income can be generated.

We can hook the transfer rules so that if the DRE object has not approved the transfer, the sale cannot occur.

Just wrapping opensea for the purposes of bot trading, fee reduction, is all useful.  Can become like our own version of opensea, particularly if we include tools to publish NFTs on the opensea.

## [[2023-04-04 1226 SILD tooling |SILD assistance]]
Make a facebook page for each person who wants to live on the island, and get to know your neighbours.

## Business Bus
Enterprise bus that can also link to the hosted global bus. [[2022-11-16 Service Bus]] [[2023-04-05 1335 Dreamcatcher Bus]]

## Raising against SILD
If we gain some license or some commitment from SILD as to being the bus on the island, we can raise capital in a public company to build out some of our systems, as the use case is defined, revenue projections from the island alone can be stated and agreed upon based on validated demand, plus the export of the systems once a usecase / showcase is deployed.  

We can raise capital where we deploy as we see fit, plus we can raise against specific packets directly.  Stake to Stay paying a royalty for auditing is one such example.  The raise is to build software and refine it in this test bed.  Securing rights to the test bed makes the raise simpler.

Residents as participants may be able to fund without SEC rules, and if a clear revenue path is shown for each packet, then it may make economic sense to fund something that benefits their home, plus has a future income possibility attached to it.
