>[!question] Targets: 

>[!danger] Depends: 

deploy and cut the overheads off the trucking business.
acquire other businesses and immediately turn them profitable.
Modify the software to handle more and more firms as this aquisition expansion continues.

take business functions and bundle them together, like call centre functions.
Sell that function to other unrelated business as a way to expand the software business.

Basically want a software company that takes a cut of the value it provides, rather than a price for the software alone.  By being aware of the value it creates, and being highly adaptive to customer needs, it is well positioned to charge by value, instead of by price.

Its adaptivity will cause it to stay embedded for a very long time.  It being owned by all its participants will ensure it never really goes out of business.
