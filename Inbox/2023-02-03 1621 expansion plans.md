>[!question] Targets: 

>[!danger] Depends: 

deploy and cut the overheads off the trucking business.
acquire other businesses and immediately turn them profitable.
Modify the software to handle more and more firms as this aquisition expansion continues.

take business functions and bundle them together, like call centre functions.
Sell that function to other unrelated business as a way to expand the software business.

Basically want a software company that takes a cut of the value it provides, rather than a price for the software alone.  By being aware of the value it creates, and being highly adaptive to customer needs, it is well positioned to charge by value, instead of by price.

Its adaptivity will cause it to stay embedded for a very long time.  It being owned by all its participants will ensure it never really goes out of business.

Treat the customer like a dignified person, and present them with easy switchability between suppliers.  Have affinity for a certain service person who can handle their matters access multiple service offerings.

As services get increasingly small, the burden of management is too great for each individual.  Cross cutting services management then becomes a service of its own.  Handles the rough edges using manual interfacing.  Gives people some weight to push back against and demand certain interfaces from difficult to change incumbents.

Taking a company fully offline, and replacing a company entirely with custom software is not an economic task for small to medium businesses.  By proving that can change, we open up vast markets across the globe, as most business is conducted by small to medium sized companies.

## Small Trucking Company
Proof of income - something that a customer values enough to pay for
Proof of framework - prove the framework actually works
Mobile
Intermittent
Full offline
Cheap fast changes
Proof of acquisition payment model

## Acquisition model
Pure capital gains
Register a pubco using catalist or similar in NZ
Capital gains is taxless in NZ
Acquire businesses into the main vehicle, gut them and softwareize them using Dreamcatcher.
Blockchain them, so instant value hit.
Use the pubco stock to acquire more.
Use revenues from these businesses to fortify share price.

## OpenIT
Make an IT company that offers open service models.


## Enabling automated markets
Using tech to make bespoke software that can connect to other pieces of software to form a marketplace for automated trade, then take a portion of that marketplace.
Automated markets th
The software is free, the catch is that we will invite you to offer your goods and services in our marketplace, and encourage you to consume from our marketplace of suppliers.
The marketplace optionally allows for ethics auditing, as provided by the software plus onsite audits, so you can purchase fully ethical goods.
When you move to purchasing ethically, we know that we will eventually get paid for this.

## Selling compute
The primary thing we want to sell is computational load.  Apps and other revenues on top of that are a bonus, but the baseline we want is compute.  This blockchain network is for large scale computation of both general and specialized kinds.  This should be the preferred way to both consume and supply compute resources.  A blockchain future necessitates computation over content addressed systems.

## A Blockchain
Making a public blockchain sounds like the best goal to keep working towards.  Then start hauling load onto it, as well as showing how private deployments are possible.  All private deployments need common services, like emails, Eth chain interactions.

Somewhat makes sense to bind doing something to help SILD at the same time, since benefits residence, showcase site, and investments, to a great receptive audience.

## Public listing
How can capital be raised inside the model of the Dreamcatcher ?  What would the stock be worth ?  Is greater utility found tackling existing blockchain use cases vs traditional software problems ? or both at the same time ?  Can a crypto raise be done out of Vanuatu ?
Wrap stock in objects so we can facilitate an exchange using just the protocol.

## An app building company
List online say we're looking for projects, provide a discounted rate using fixed pricing, no timelines but you can easily see progress, test cases for our blockchain systems.  Invite people to apply for paid work, where we generate packets, and attempt to complete them - no win, no fee.

## Hosting
Having a hosting provider seems essential to any kind of growth, particularly since we need to host publicly accessible dreamcatcher instances, and provide very low barrier to operation for new devs.
Model would be host a static page however you like - ghpages being an easy one.
We will host your chains up to a certain free size and free usage limit.
Outside those limits, or with extended support, you need to pay.  If you want privacy, you have to pay.  New users are a new limit, so their usage is charged separately.  Anyone can pay for anyone elses chain to run on our host.

If you host the software yourself, you should pay, but we have no way to enforce it.
You can run your own host, since our infrastructure software is open too.

We need privacy perservation for this service.
We can make a separate host for each privacy requiring installation, which has limited dial peers.

Use S3 backend and free startup credits to save on costs.
Storage model is forever if paid.  Forever best effort if free.
The longer data goes without being referenced, the deeper it gets persisted, so that decades on data may take up to a week to recover.

Data transfer will incur fees, and up to some limit
Free tier is paid by staking in pools, where money goes in, and
This is how we get back some of the cost of storing free data.

We can implement paid hosting and can ship certed units to remote locations which are public data, so only correctness matters - not privacy.  Users can have some free data, and user accounts are always free ?

Have the high quality AWS grade one, but also the cheap homebuilt hardware running in a garage version. Plus a private custom supported one which guarantees confidentiality.

Later make our own static page host making it ghpages compatible.
Wrap the AWS api in objects so we can control the infrastructure we run on using our own chains.

GPU tasks using docker images to hold all the logic, controlled by Dreamcatcher and metered by the Dreamcatcher.  Be able to provide a wrapper to any docker image that on Dreamcatcher you can run it up, install or configure it any way you want, launch it, then send interactive commands into it, with resources controlled by what you purchased on dreamcatcher.  Almost exactly like AWS except should be much cheaper as it is consistently spot rates, and you can operate in hybrid cloud mode.

## Link to Opensea
ERC1155 contract integration that mints new NFTs representing the amount of money that was paid in to an item.  This can only be done for security cleared items, to avoid being a security.
Should have general interface to link 

We can sell software access tokens as NFTs so that income can be generated.

We can hook the transfer rules so that if the DRE object has not approved the transfer, the sale cannot occur.

Just wrapping opensea for the purposes of bot trading, fee reduction, is all useful.  Can become like our own version of opensea, particularly if we include tools to publish NFTs on the opensea.

## [[2023-04-04 1226 SILD tooling |SILD assistance]]
Make a facebook page for each person who wants to live on the island, and get to know your neighbours.

## Business Bus
Enterprise bus that can also link to the hosted global bus. [[2022-11-16 Service Bus]] [[2023-04-05 1335 Dreamcatcher Bus]]

## Raising against SILD
If we gain some license or some commitment from SILD as to being the bus on the island, we can raise capital in a public company to build out some of our systems, as the use case is defined, revenue projections from the island alone can be stated and agreed upon based on validated demand, plus the export of the systems once a usecase / showcase is deployed.  

We can raise capital where we deploy as we see fit, plus we can raise against specific packets directly.  Stake to Stay paying a royalty for auditing is one such example.  The raise is to build software and refine it in this test bed.  Securing rights to the test bed makes the raise simpler.

Residents as participants may be able to fund without SEC rules, and if a clear revenue path is shown for each packet, then it may make economic sense to fund something that benefits their home, plus has a future income possibility attached to it.

## Funding on Eth
Make a DAO in marshall islands, use juicebox to govern it, get payments in Eth, vote to spend those payments on packets using weak bonding with the packets being proposals to start with, then gradually transition over to the Dreamcatcher as different degrees of operational stability are achieved.

Goal of the DAO is to leave ETH and ultimately work directly on the dreamcatcher.

Mint NFTs to represent packets on Dreamcatcher.   The only thing you own is the money you put in, and this can be withdrawn at any time.  Then you can fund different packets using it.

Can we build the dreamcatcher on ethereum using solidity first ?  DAO voting rights mean participation, probably if exercised or not.  If the DAO can only spend money from members who opted in, this is clear participation - then if the final payout is based only on the participant approving, this is definitely participation.  Participation is what gives people the feeling that they are safely spendin their money since they agree the goal is good, but they retain control of their funds at all times.

Use juicebox or some other system to get exposure and front end, then make proposals be custom so they are linked to packets, and make it so only committed funds can be spent.

Tokens can convey the rights to change the license terms of the software in some way - this is a form of value.
Only once income has come in that passes the distribution test can packets be traded.  Buying into juice still requires participation.

So its fundamentally a way to get exposure, use some tooling, 

BASED ON ALL THIS, we should just make the dreamcatcher directly and give it a ETH wallet to manage how funds get moved around ?

Sell on OpenSea so that fundage can be minted to people using NFTs ?

Your investment will not earn anything unless you participate, so there is no 3rd party to rely upon.
Make a gateway site dedicated to connecting a web3 wallet and connecting that to dreamcatcher plus making payments into your balance.  Otherwise you use our account management directly.  Wrap DAI in our token, or basically move any asset into our contract.  Trading on DeFi then pools the actions of all so minimal fees and swapping internally nets out before using gas.

## Funding each project on SI
Each new venture should be a set of packets, and the funding might be handled by a specific securities vehicle which can take securitized funds and deploy them.

## Robotarmy the tax entity
If a DAO is set up to act as the gateway, so that everyone can trust it to provide money services, then a worker company should be set up to act on behalf of us.  We would hire freelancers out of this company, and pay them, then packet payments would be controlled by the company.  They would not be considered income until they got drawn down.  This company need not be a DAO at all.  If securities were sold in it, then it should use traditional means, not anything new.

Use this DAO to act on behalf of other entities, only for receiving income from others, then attributing them out.  So it could take in stripe payments, acting as itself, but they paying to specific projects.

Participation in the packets is covered per packet, and tradeability is covered by decentalization, so they can never be securities, but they can be funded by outsiders.  So having no actual securities is not a hamper to finding investment.

Robotarmy could be taken public, where its goal is to work within this protocol and build up this protocol.  But it is better as a DAO so that packets can be continually purged out to people.

Any fund would just be amplifying the packet payments I myself make, perhaps weighted against others on the team, so it doesn't need to be something controlled by me, but rather something that algorithmically shadows.  A pure public company could perform this duty.



## Eth Dreamcatcher
The DreamEther.
Deploy this contract, start putting all work thru the Dreamcatcher in this way.
Demonstrate a commercial company that allows interactions with traditional clients.


There is a similarity between the attribution system of ukraine, the charity metaverse, and satoshi island build out.
