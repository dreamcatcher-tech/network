>[!question] Targets: 

>[!danger] Depends: 

deploy and cut the overheads off the trucking business.
acquire other businesses and immediately turn them profitable.
Modify the software to handle more and more firms as this aquisition expansion continues.

take business functions and bundle them together, like call centre functions.
Sell that function to other unrelated business as a way to expand the software business.

Basically want a software company that takes a cut of the value it provides, rather than a price for the software alone.  By being aware of the value it creates, and being highly adaptive to customer needs, it is well positioned to charge by value, instead of by price.

Its adaptivity will cause it to stay embedded for a very long time.  It being owned by all its participants will ensure it never really goes out of business.

Treat the customer like a dignified person, and present them with easy switchability between suppliers.  Have affinity for a certain service person who can handle their matters access multiple service offerings.

As services get increasingly small, the burden of management is too great for each individual.  Cross cutting services management then becomes a service of its own.  Handles the rough edges using manual interfacing.  Gives people some weight to push back against and demand certain interfaces from difficult to change incumbents.

Taking a company fully offline, and replacing a company entirely with custom software is not an economic task for small to medium businesses.  By proving that can change, we open up vast markets across the globe, as most business is conducted by small to medium sized companies.

## Small Trucking Company
Proof of income - something that a customer values enough to pay for
Proof of framework - prove the framework actually works
Mobile
Intermittent
Full offline
Cheap fast changes
Proof of acquisition payment model

## Acquisition model
Pure capital gains
Register a pubco using catalist or similar in NZ
Capital gains is taxless in NZ
Acquire businesses into the main vehicle, gut them and softwareize them using Dreamcatcher.
Blockchain them, so instant value hit.
Use the pubco stock to acquire more.
Use revenues from these businesses to fortify share price.

## OpenIT
Make an IT company that offers open service models.


## Enabling automated markets
Using tech to make bespoke software that can connect to other pieces of software to form a marketplace for automated trade, then take a portion of that marketplace.
Automated markets th
The software is free, the catch is that we will invite you to offer your goods and services in our marketplace, and encourage you to consume from our marketplace of suppliers.
The marketplace optionally allows for ethics auditing, as provided by the software plus onsite audits, so you can purchase fully ethical goods.
When you move to purchasing ethically, we know that we will eventually get paid for this.

## Selling compute
The primary thing we want to sell is computational load.  Apps and other revenues on top of that are a bonus, but the baseline we want is compute.  This blockchain network is for large scale computation of both general and specialized kinds.  This should be the preferred way to both consume and supply compute resources.  A blockchain future necessitates computation over content addressed systems.

## A Blockchain
Making a public blockchain sounds like the best goal to keep working towards.  Then start hauling load onto it, as well as showing how private deployments are possible.  All private deployments need common services, like emails, Eth chain interactions.

Somewhat makes sense to bind doing something to help SILD at the same time, since benefits residence, showcase site, and investments, to a great receptive audience.

## Public listing
How can capital be raised inside the model of the Dreamcatcher ?  What would the stock be worth ?  Is greater utility found tackling existing blockchain use cases vs traditional software problems ? or both at the same time ?  Can a crypto raise be done out of Vanuatu ?

## An app building company
List online say we're looking for projects, provide a discounted rate using fixed pricing, no timelines but you can easily see progress, test cases for our blockchain systems.
