deploy and cut the overheads off the trucking business.
acquire other businesses and immediately turn them profitable.
Modify the software to handle more and more firms as this aquisition expansion continues.

Basically want a software company that takes a cut of the value it provides, rather than a price for the software alone.  By being aware of the value it creates, and being highly adaptive to customer needs, it is well positioned to charge by value, instead of by price.

As services get increasingly small, the burden of management is too great for each individual.  Cross cutting services management then becomes a service of its own.  Handles the rough edges using manual interfacing.  Gives people some weight to push back against and demand certain interfaces from difficult to change incumbents.
