Curate a list of unsolved problems in different fields, then grind o1 thru all the frontier research in all other fields to see if any of it fits in other areas.

> Should be a lot of prizes sitting in there - this could become a community effort, and could be done using sponsors who put up money to sponsor credits.  Make some tools to check if the credits are being spent on the genuine purpose, or just allow people to open up their prompts and if they happen to be doing something for some sponsored research, they get cheap credits.

Go talk to large AI providers to gain access to these cheap credits.

Allow multiple funders to pay otu at the same time.

Can also grind thru history and tell a tale of a repository.
