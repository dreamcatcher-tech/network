 So I got an idea whereby we make a group of people and put in some money or whatever and then if you want to run a startup what you can do is you can create one within this group now if you do that the startup is controlled by this AI CEO so make sure that you don't do anything stupid that you're always grounded in data and it is the progress reports and all that kind of thing and then what the benefit of that is that you can raise money from this group of people because they all trust that that machine will do all the mechanical stuff correctly and they're really betting on is your idea correct plus it makes it switchable so that if you have an issue like dying then the idea can continue almost without losing a beat It also means that ideas merge so that there's never two investments that conflict with each other. all of these systems can benefit from shared global offices. Workforces can come from a pool of people that trust the system. That kind of thing. So it's like a little company where the investors are able to invest on a per project basis. Anyone can come and work for the company or propose a project. We will assign a project manager. The incentives of the project manager will be set based on our top level incentives using reinforcement learning to try to optimize the outcomes.
