we have this fixed list of problems, and measurable outcomes.

we should be able to prompt a tuner to attempt to improve the score.

each changne, it runs ten times in parallel, to gather all the variances.

it just loops around, charting its course, and showing small improvements, trying new ideas, as well testing all the human ideas that come in.

It would be prompted to not solve for the problem directly, since that would be easy, but rrather that it shold be genuinely useful and also solve goals across the board, as well as being minimal.
