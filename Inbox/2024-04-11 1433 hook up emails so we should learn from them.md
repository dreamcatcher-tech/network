If you gain access to a gmail account, we should be able to ingest all that mail, and then also process it to pull out nuggests of info that we refine to get a list of facts.

We should also be able to generate examples of your specific style and mannerisms, and in particular how you talk to specific people.

This shouldn't be inference based, but rather based on a model of communication that we can develop, so that it in effect programs the LLM, rather than trains it.

Can also generate a company theme, and when we correct an email before it goes out, people should be able to ask questions as to why things were that way.

Facts can be debated and corrected as things progress.

If one person in the org introduces new information, it is recorded.  Everyone can see the new info that was entered into the system from various sources.

Based on the fact that everyone is speaking truthfully, and so it takes everything as fact unless there is a contradiction, in which case it will query.
