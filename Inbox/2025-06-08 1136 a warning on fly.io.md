we should always be looking to hit bare metal ourselves, so never do to much work to get around their abstraction model.

We want to ultimately run a compute marketplaces, and so we would set up hardware and just dump it in a pool - can be our own hardware running on a home, or something on a server rack somewhere.

At a certain layer, the abstractions below get in the way.

need bare metal ultimately, since we need enclaves.
