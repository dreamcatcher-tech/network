if the model was open, but it was trained in a way that it knew if you paid for it, then it could demand a certain amount of money ?

or, if you only accessed it on dreamcatcher, then the model earns when the model is used, so an incentive exists to make improvements to the model, since everyone is paying fairly when they run it, but the model makers don't have to manage infrastructure, also they can outsource the training compute by ambient attribution, and they have access to everyones owned data if they want to give it up for training.  That is a great model making environment.  Plus a flood of ideas on how to make improvements.  Also escvrow funding for little tasks that need doing.
