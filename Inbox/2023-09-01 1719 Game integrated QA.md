If a game was able to act as a QA to define when certain events have occurred, then tasks can be created to do in game activities which are definitively completed.

This enables side wagers, and other types of gambling, all with NFTs being staked on a certain thing. 

A betting book could be made of opposing tasks where each side of the bet is a negation of the other sides QA event.
