Instead of considering dictation as being simply a microphone button on the text input to the chat, it should be a tool that can be triggered using a hotkey or a button push and applied anywhere on the webpage with the input directed wherever is specified. 

And so when the cursor has moved around, I could be placing the cursor within a partially typed message in the input box, and then the dictation would intelligently insert it in this location.

All the recordings or the usage of the recording tools should be visible in a particular file structure within the user's home directory. This file structure should include the raw data of the transcript (if they want) with some deletion preferences as well as the AI transcript that resulted from it. The raw one and the doctored one. 

This means that I can use the transcription tool within a widget. I can use the transcription tool to navigate the UI. I can use the transcription tool to precisely insert within the chat box. And I can use the transcription tool for long periods of time, such as when I am in a video conference call. 

The microphone that I use should be available to me from a remote machine if I so wish it to be. 

While I am using the transcription tool in one widget as a long-running tool like in this continuous capture mode, I should also be able to use it like a transcription tool somewhere else or fire up another widget and have a second long-running conversation. The key is that the microphone is treated as a source that is always on and then the dictation tool just simply taps into that and puts it anywhere within the app. As well, widgets can directly call on the microphone depending on their use case too.
