seems best to come from inside, as the people who make the products - those who love the product the most - can cycle thru iterations.

then the bots would help them generate slogans based on full context.

but they would also auto do this for new products.

plus do channel based testing and figure out how to get exposure.

Map out all kinds of extra data, like new building permits, so can secure advertising leading up to these sites, so you know when people are about to purchase curtains, so advertise to them more.

ad tech that should listen in to wifi signals in phones and things so it can ID the same people driving past.

so if the platform was ai and came from internal people chatting, then it comes down to purchasing channels and placements.

If the bots give advice on placements, and on experiments, and if people could offer specialized expertise, then the spend from the marketers goes all on the channel and the platform.

can plug in different services to make a pipeline.

so basically, where people used to consume multiple disjoint services from 'experts' the ai platforms can coordinate and manage all these people.  So its really just one platform that switches out people and frames and mcapps to produce a single flow.

It should be able to broker deals, and to hire and fire people, running analysis.
