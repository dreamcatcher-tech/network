seems best to come from inside, as the people who make the products - those who love the product the most - can cycle thru iterations.

then the bots would help them generate slogans based on full context.

but they would also auto do this for new products.

plus do channel based testing and figure out how to get exposure.

Map out all kinds of extra data, like new building permits, so can secure advertising leading up to these sites, so you know when people are about to purchase curtains, so advertise to them more.

ad tech that should listen in to wifi signals in phones and things so it can ID the same people driving past.
