If we have helpful logging thruout, then it makes sense to make debug be hookable  ?

Or, just make a standard hook inside the repo where we can hook the methods and then cause the program to step forwards under our control, where we modify the concurrency controls.

Maybe take a symbol and attach it as the key to the object, and use this to pass the hook around.
