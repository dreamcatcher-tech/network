It might be that we need to speak together in a way that captures a concept thoroughly, in order that we consider it a genuine concept.

So in a meeting, we would fire this tool up, and start having our audio streams go into this, so the concept gets filled out and reasoned about rapidly.

Develop an AI-driven conversational oversight tool that:

1. Receives real-time, speaker-tagged, transcribed audio from a technical conversation.
2. Identifies when a participant prematurely draws conclusions and issues immediate, visible warnings.
3. Tracks conceptual “threads” introduced by any speaker. When a concept is left incomplete or ambiguous, the tool generates multiple alternative interpretations.
4. Presents large, simple UI buttons to guide further clarifications or re-interpretations.
5. Continuously logs the conversation’s concepts and highlights failures to fully communicate them.

Use a pipeline that starts with real-time speech-to-text input and a streaming LLM prompt context. Track speaker turns, tagging each utterance with speaker identity. Feed each utterance to an LLM fine-tuned or instructed for meta-conversation analysis. The LLM would:

1. Look for “jumping to conclusions” patterns—premature conclusions without intermediate steps—and immediately raise a warning flag (e.g. trigger a UI alert).
2. Maintain a concept buffer: when a speaker starts laying out a concept, the model marks it as “in-progress.” If the concept ends ambiguously (no resolution) or the speaker passes the turn before finishing, the model updates status to “incomplete” and generates alternate interpretations.
3. For each concept introduced, generate 2–3 re-interpretations that highlight gaps or ambiguities.
4. Continuously log concepts and who introduced them.
5. Expose a minimal interactive UI with a few large actionable buttons—e.g. “Clarify this concept further,” “Confirm if the concept was understood,” or “Reinterpret the concept”—that user presses to guide the LLM’s next inference steps.
