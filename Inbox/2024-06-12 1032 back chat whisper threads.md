Need a way to chat on the side with the system, or make notes for later.

Need a way to discuss the sharing status of a particular thread.

This backstage view can do anything administrative.  It is aware of what level it is at, and is aware of what other threads there are - like a thread management tool.

Can't have backstage of backstage.

Add a backstage note, so use the add button to enter backstage ?

Show it clearly as taking over the whole page and changing color that this is like admin mode.

To backstage about a specific message, or a part of a message, select the item, then click 'add backstage' which is a chat about this chat, with things like permissions.

Select multiple chats or parts in the add button, so they show up as stacked.
