Each runner has a set number of responsibilities.
Execution tracing can be gantt charted for the queue items, which is each runner.

Then inside these, we can describe the program flow, and sample the estimated times to run.

Should be able to generate some example flows, unrolled, so we can see, and show how these blocks of functionality combine.
