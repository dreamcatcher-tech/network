We would make the git storage take in a blob storage adapter.

Atomic ops would take in an atomic storage adapter.

atomic is for small expensive high consistency storage.  Blob is for the heavy stuff.

Blobs may not be consistent, they just have to be durable, so if we write them, we want to observe them to be readable, and we might retry if they are not present.

How could we make a local version of the s3 service ?

We could replicate its behaviour using denokv ? or just use a local filesystem as the blob store ?

Use a file lock and just write that way ?
