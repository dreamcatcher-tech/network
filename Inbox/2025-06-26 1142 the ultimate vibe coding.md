every day usage should be triggering faults, taking measurements like distance between clicks, and tuning the application.

It would also look for repeated patterns of use and create / suggest shortcuts.

Basically if we started using an app and started talking about it, the bots should figure out what makes good sense, and start reconciling that against recommended good practice, and have some high taste testing agents that navigate and comment based on the nuance of changes that occured.

so we should be able to read code files, spit out errors about them, and have the bots try to reconcile all these things, and then try make higher level rules so the issues don't happen again, then pre-emptively sweep all the other files and see if the same rules can improve them.

basically about us never having to tell the bot twice, and have it adapt to our preferences, and when it finds contradiction in our preferences, working thru that with us.
