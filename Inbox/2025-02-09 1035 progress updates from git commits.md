Should be able to detect debugging activity due to the surgical nature of the commits, vs the bulk wholesale rewrites.

Can mark those sections as particularly difficult - debugging is where the bulk of the value is added, and it takes a lot of hard labour.

We should be able to use this time to generate more thorough tests, as each theory that machine and human comes up with is tested against first, and then the code fixed.

Seems like tests actually capture the true intent of the code, which can be difficult to spec ?

Maybe the tests could be little math formulas ?
