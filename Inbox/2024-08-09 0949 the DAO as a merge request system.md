A simple user story for the DAO.

Start editing a proposal document.
Second person makes some changes.
the diffs are presented and chatted about, with reasoning contributing to a fact pool.
individual facts are debated over and merged.

stateboard shows diffs side by side.
Make a special widget for having multiple versions side by side, like 10.
Also can chat about and summarize the changes.
Generate ai batches of changes, where there is some similarity between all the changes, so we can have a discussion about each type of change - this gets extracted out to an atom - at least if we can agree on an atom together, we are making progress.

Maybe simpler than a doc is an atomic fact list ?
Or maybe a doc is the simplest case of this ?

Pass commentary on a proposal given a body of knowledge.

Trouble is that the AI isn't making any decisions in any way, it is merely assisting.
Test allowing small deviations on the plan ?
Test requiring updates to be posted or the funding gets cut.

another good starting use case is the tracking of progress from KOLs - so they need to submit progress in some way, and if the AI deems progress is outside of the agreement, the AI blocks the funding, so it excuses any given person having to seem rude, it is simply the rules being set and then the AI executing them intelligently, politely, mercilessly - this is how blockchain was supposed to be, but without intelligence it is very limited

Casting a vote vs editing.
Show someones vote weight during proposal editing.
Editing based on things you definitely do not support is different to supporting the whole thing.

atoms voting

Break apart even booking times for KOLs and others to attend the island.
Set some overall rules, and then allow comment and vote on specifics, so long as it doesn't override some prior rules.

Show a bot that will not make a change to a previously agreed rule.  So once we decide to do something, you can't back out from it.  This is the essence of blockchain DAO.

Take in a lot of discussion from the whole community, including unvetted members.
The SENSITIVITY aspect of the DAO is to show that an unauthd person can ask a question and that then gets processed and bubbles up into an atom that the AI thinks is important, and gathers weight from other people boosting it.  So everyone who voices an opinion can see the impact of what they said instead of feeling like they're talking to a brick wall.

Atom extraction from conversation.
Parse all the channel logs and extra atoms and assign to authors.  Extract creator badges, and do a contribution split ready for attribution.
Score people and give badges for certain grades.

Atom extraction from documents.

Agreement on atoms, and storing the discussion.  This is a shared discussion of many with the AI.
