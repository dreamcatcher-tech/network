A simple user story for the DAO.

Start editing a proposal document.
Second person makes some changes.
the diffs are presented and chatted about, with reasoning contributing to a fact pool.
individual facts are debated over and merged.

Maybe simpler than a doc is an atomic fact list ?
Or maybe a doc is the simplest case of this ?

Pass commentary on a proposal given a body of knowledge.

How can a test that drives the stateboard or does individual document editing be tested ?
Need to make some assertions about the stateboard state too.

How can the test drive be viewed while it is running, so we can see the interactions live, as they are happening, in another window ?
