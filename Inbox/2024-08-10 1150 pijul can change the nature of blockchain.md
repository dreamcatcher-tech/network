Reaching consensus can be somehow swifter and more gentle, since it does not require one and only one path.

You can agree on a patches in any order, so long as you never agree to conflicting patches.

You can revoke your agreements ?

These might be considered precommit rounds, and then everyones valid patches are combined together into a final round.

Means that things can be added in to the final commit late, since multiple precommit votes were possible.

As a starter, we can try defining some messages for tendermint, and then using strict functions to ensure we generate them correctly, as well as reasoning steps, and then see how the system behaves.

Make an AI orchestrator that tries to map out all combinations of things, and actively tries to generate scenarios that generate a failure, by controlling the network completely in terms of blocking some messages, as well as setting some actors to send conflicting signs.

Allow nodes to tell tales on each other.
