If you stake against a task being done, that is saying that, if it is done to an acceptable standard, you agree to pay for it.   You could set that to auto, but could undo that any time.

The theory is, is social pressure enough so that if you stake against something your a very likely to pay ?

Is it enough to give the final choice, at the time of presentation, to the person with the money to pay for it or not ?

Does that make it not a security, since the money was for some work that had been done, and if it makes money or not is irrelevant, you have paid for the work to be done that you asked to be done by staking the money.

So two points of participation:
1. asking for it to be done
2. paying the money for it, signaling acceptance.

So long as our workflows have a very clear path of participation ?
ambient attribution needs to be independent of the work being done ?
It needs to be so etherlike that you could just as easily say "i hope that someone acknowledges my good work"

at point of payment, we would calculate worth ? so we would show you projected future worth ?

Maybe you couldn't make the payment unless you state something insightful about the project, like a video call or something ?
