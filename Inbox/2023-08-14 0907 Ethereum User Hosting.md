A service for Ethereum where we manage users' logins using conventional mechanisms like OAuth, GitHub, Gmail, Facebook, etc, but we map that to signing keys of a private account, which may also be connected up in multi-sig form or may have inheritance or safeguards or some kind of a control over the top, which might be the system administrators. 

Safeguard system administrators requiring this extra super high level type of intervention mechanism, such as a quorum or some other kind of external pass or a time delay or something like that. 

What it means is that people can very rapidly deliver an application that is a Web 2.0 type of flow, but it is backed by Web 3.0 and users can take their Web 3.0 lives into their own hands if they want. And in doing this, the launching company saves a lot of the security and auditing requirements because they can rely on the blockchain for reliability, resilience, traceability, incorruptibility, and they can rely on this authentication service to handle the GDPR dangerous data and to ensure that customers are looked after correctly so they don't have to set up any of that. 

Company can be launched with just purely a smart contract and a static web page. The static web page may also be part of the hosting company in order to maintain internet integrity, but the point is that an application can have an extremely high level of trust akin to banks without a lot of labor or time up front, and no continual audit requirements.

The hosting company would charge a fee, since it needs to take on the audit burden, but because it takes it on for infrastructure that can be scaled easily, it can afford to sell this service.

The burden of KYC can also be passed to this company, to handle account recovery permissions.
