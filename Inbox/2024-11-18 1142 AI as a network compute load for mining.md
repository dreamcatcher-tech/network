As the model sizes get larger, the data centrers might find it hard to keep up.

If the AI responses are rapid enough, then each home can store a part of the model and a part of the compute, and can sell responses to part queries.

So token generations are streaming out from multiple locations all at once.

Is better use than mining bitcoin, which is a total waste of energy.

This tied in with confidential computing, and a new networking protocol that allows multi hop routing to be done rapidly without buffering means the compute is distributed.

It might be too much compute to ever house centrally, since we'll probably burn all the main energy on the server farms.
