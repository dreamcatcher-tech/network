openrouter has a stripe entry point, and a coinbase crypto payment provider.

they sell only for usage.

We could in fact separate out the entities, so you can pay for just pure usage, and build up a balance, and then as a separate entity, you can escrow funds.

Then maybe separate again, is the processing for the usage of the apps.

Crypto should be allowed in all areas, but we maintain these separate entities, and make sure money doesn't cross between them.

Usage of credits for AI use and the purchase of app usage could be the same thing.

Then we convert to crypto, and do the dispersements that way ?
