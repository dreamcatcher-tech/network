If we make a private install, we should be able to link and communicate with someone elses installation.

So we can have totally private hosted ones in deno, we can have locally installed versions running.  If the permissions allow, these installs should be able to find each other.

Users should be able to take their accounts and run them locally, and optionally merge them back in with our hosted solution.  The portability of data is a result of the repeatability of the computation.

Running a version in a ghaction requires the inputs to be submitted as git PRs, not as live actions.  This should be supported, since this is how communications occur internally anyway.
