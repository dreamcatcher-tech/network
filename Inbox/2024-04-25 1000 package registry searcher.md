If we provide AI assisted package search we can bridge the new diverging registries.  So we would preprocess everything on all the registries, and then when you're looking for something, provide suggestions with actual code samples that would help you.

While you code, the assistant suggests packages that might help you, or packages that need to be created to make your life easier.

Crawl open source code and see where a new package could be slotted in.

We really want code editing to be online, using massive parallelism and AI assistance, making it a team effort, even without you actively participating in the team.
