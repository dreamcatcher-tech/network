Sketch something on paper, then have a chat with it to get the lines right, and provide an editor to permit some tweaks.

Then generate gcode for it.

Calculate scale by having any object held in front of it.  Can be manually tweaked.

Chat interface is good since it lets you be hands free.

Can extract paths out of photos of things, like a persons outline.

Generate pictures using dalle, then use the picture as input for image processing, to refine the path generated.

Having a feature that the users like, such as natural language, then because openAI must be paid, we need to be able to charge them, which makes the relationship easier to transition into paying customer, particularly if its leveraged on top of credits.

Start a marketplace for people to touch up images that aren't working right, which we use to train our prompts better.  Marketplace for manufacturing of the out, which has local advantages, or special machines, or of people simply don't have machines.
