So common to be in a conversation and someone says, "Do you know company XYZ or person ABC?" What we should do is allow for a mapping tool that can listen into your conversations, do the background research. Ideally, the other person would use a similar tool beforehand, so that you're receiving or being briefed on the research that's already been conducted by other members of the network, along with the opinions that we all hold. This would make the retrieval faster, the tokens cheaper, the knowledge graph richer, and the ability to identify fellow members who are circling around the same information as you within our network.
