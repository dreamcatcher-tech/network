If we also mock the set timeout functions, then we can hook those into artifact, to allow that functionality to be available inside of isolate runs.

We need to be in an isolated container, else the time might be faked by accident ?

Or, we could set it only when we start the execution run, with the RNG seeded and all the timers hooked.

Later, once we have SES, this is less of an issue.
