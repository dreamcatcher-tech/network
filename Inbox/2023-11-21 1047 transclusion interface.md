HAL should be able to answer "who changed this last ?" and know to use the transclusion functions of the system.

Transclusion links should be either local, or offsite.  Gui elements help choose which ones, and HAL can use args to say what navigations it wants to take.

Transclusion should be a way of generating notes with many atoms sprinkled around the place.

A huge problem with AI LLMs is that they are not easily able to show what the sources of their knowledge is.  Using a transclusion based system to simply look up what they nearness of the things they reported is, and scoring and attributing to that is much more practical and simple.

This is an example of a nugget of information that shouldn't be of the same height as everything else, that should be connected automatically with the rest of my body of knowledge, and to the knowledge trees of my friends, and it should show up to my friends as suggestions for things to build their documents upon.
