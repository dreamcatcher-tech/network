HAL should be able to answer "who changed this last ?" and know to use the transclusion functions of the system.

Transclusion links should be either local, or offsite.  Gui elements help choose which ones, and HAL can use args to say what navigations it wants to take.

Transclusion should be a way of generating notes with many atoms sprinkled around the place.
