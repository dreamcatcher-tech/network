As part of the context, when you click it, there is a screenshot of what was going on ?
Probably want to disable this in settings.

If settings was a chat, then you could do this easier, but you could also do it from inside a bot that had access to the system assistant.

We want to restrict what a model has access to, so it doesn't get confused, but as models get better this will matter less.
