Make a WGS84 based data layer where sensors and plans can be placed upon.

This is a proof of concept for the metaverse.

Provide this mapping system as the base layer of the metaverse - will contain:
1. A blockchain based data layer of arbitrary size
2. A viewer of the blockchain layer, which can fuse multiple datasets together in realtime
3. A piece of infrastructure, namely a sensor, which can update its data in realtime
4. A citizen, namely a phone app, which can update its data in realtime.
