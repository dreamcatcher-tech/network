If we want to share a location with someone else, would be nice to use the url as a way of sending them exactly to where we are, but that relies upon them having installed it in the same place, which seems unlikely to be successful.

So we could store the chainId in the browser url in shortened form and then get back the pulse in question ?

Or, we could require a share being something active in the app ?
