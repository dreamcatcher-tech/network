Make a model on the Dreamcatcher that connects to the ETH chain and shows how ownership of the land plots is changing over time, and what the valuation is.  Basically build tooling for the island that is also good for us, and aim to be their platform of choice.

They will need an offline first blockchain due to the internet connectivity issues assosciated with the island.  Needs to be metaverse compatible.  Serves as great advertising for us and them.

Show project management tooling using distributed nature that lets people ask questions by PR'ing against the project plan - let multiple people propose changes to the project plan, and have a metrics dashboard that scores their proposals.

Advertise the Dreamcatcher thru a block of land being purchased.

## Hedging
Being uncertain of the finished layout of the island, buying sections in all suburbs would be best, then picking or conglomerating them.

## Agent bridging
Bridge traditional services into blockchain space, use the unregulated nature of the laws of the land, and the private membership nature.  Health insurance via pooling, snail mail services, laundry services.

## Gambling on project timelines
Estimating when different aspects will come online.

## Rebranding for AI
Make it a nexus for AI + blockchain.  
So the land governance is controlled by an AI arbitrator, like approvals for building, incentives to change how the island should be.  Humans seem to easily agree on the principles of what they all want, but they can't agree on the implementation or the execution, or who should pay for both.  So we can set up some models that work well in theory, and then present these as the way in which approvals for activity is granted, to remove the humans from the loop.

Smart cities are programmable cities, and so 

Generate scenarios that people can describe then show what the outcome would be.
Break apart each scenario into atoms and then test all combinations of those scenarios.
Check them against invariant appraisals that we set up like a dashboard.
