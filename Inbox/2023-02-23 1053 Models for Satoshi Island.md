Make a model on the Dreamcatcher that connects to the ETH chain and shows how ownership of the land plots is changing over time, and what the valuation is.  Basically build tooling for the island that is also good for us, and aim to be their platform of choice.

They will need an offline first blockchain due to the internet connectivity issues assosciated with the island.

Show project management tooling using distributed nature that lets people ask questions by PR'ing against the project plan - let multiple people propose changes to the project plan, and have a metrics dashboard that scores their proposals.

Advertise the Dreamcatcher thru a block of land being purchased.

## Hedging
Being uncertain of the finished layout of the island, buying sections in all suburbs would be best, then picking or conglomerating them.
