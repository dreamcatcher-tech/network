Given the lack of impact tools, perhaps Dreamcatcher is best as a focused niche on impact focused project management and funding.

These are people that care strongly about ambient attribution, 

Making a shared simulation platform to experiment with impact and track each individual directly can have further benefits outside of just the impact platform.
Impact can be shared between actors, so getting them to cooperate seems much easier.
Commemorating the impact immutably is also of more valuable to them than people looking to get paid.

The industry seems large, and seems underserved by tools.

This is one of the few industries that would recognize that the impact platform was due some attribution of the impact, particularly since it needs to be highly aware of what it is being used for.

Make a way that a bcorp company can be appraised on the impact they are having.

We could open the platform to small players, like under $1,000, like a crowdsourcing investment system.  Also charity could be unbundled, so people can be very specific, but can contribute more than just money - time and other resources can be donated or charged for at possibly discounted rates.

The living data should be the lab, rather than relying on stale sampled studies.

We should also be able to generatively transform one given study into another set of circumstances, with crowdsourced ideas and objections to the transform.
