Use an LLM to do bulk mailings that are tailored to a specific customer.

Make a CRM that has LLM integration to provide personalized advice to each customer.

Makes each customer feel like they have a direct relationship with the company.

Talks about the customers relationship, and offers things relevant to the customer.

When the customer calls up, we can have an LLM generated summary of their current posture so the person on the phone is rapidly bought up to speed about them.  Conversation is real time interpreted and the LLM continues to steer the conversation and offer suggestions to the person taking the call.
