Sometimes data in DRE chains also need to be pinned on IPFS for things like opensea metadata.
We could expand this to be any data at all could be pinned and managed using Dreamcatcher.

If you purchase the IPFS pinning service on Dreamcatcher, you put funds in, and we hold the items in chain, and rely on our chain distribution mechanisms to store it, then we bridge at some rate limited amount to ipfs.

If you pay extra, then we will provide high bandwidth nodes and report the request stats on chain.  Anyone, including you, can run one of these nodes, and we can even make it favour you.

To lubricate the system, we will provide free boost bandwidth up to some free limit with some burstability that builds up over time for a particular piece of data.

Can monitor the availability of your IPFS data from multiple locations on earth using DRE distributed chain.
