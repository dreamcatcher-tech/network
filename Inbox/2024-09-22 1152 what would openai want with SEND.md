our guess at what openai wants, is:
- overall, openai wants to experience areas where openai is currently not used
- they want to know the problems that we are having using their ai in these diverse areas
- they don't want access to the data directly, but they might want to know where the shortcomings are from us using private data - inference from a distance

The more niche opportunities we can pull together, the more support we get from openai, so hence the need to have a JV that can expand.
