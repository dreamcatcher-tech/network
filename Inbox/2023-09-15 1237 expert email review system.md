Offer clients to plug in to an api where their staff send out emails, but they get run past the experts AI service first, and get marked up and sent back to the humans.

If the humans email back with some questions, then a real human pops in to explain it.
They optionally get checked over by a human before going out.

The expert changes are used to train the machine.  The training of the machine is kept proprietary.
