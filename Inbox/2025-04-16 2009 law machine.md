Make a platform where it's $50 and we'll contest any parking ticket or any kind of offense. The bots can ask you detailed questions, trying all sorts of angles with you to ensure that you're satisfied with the answers given, that all avenues have been exhausted. It can try and come up with some creative types of angles, asking you questions to narrow down which ones might apply. It can give you paths that are simply obfuscating or frustrating the court system through communication that is your right. It can rate your chances of success and lead on to having a very cheap but legitimate lawyer stamp the case in places where it's required for filings.

It can handle all the filings, all the paperwork, and all the running around - a very cheap way just to make sure that you get the best deal possible out of the system. And might help you find some peace from talking with a machine that knows more than any human has all the time in the world and all the knowledge as well.
