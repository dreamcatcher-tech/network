The ability to have a single object which represents a total view of unlimited data is powerful.

It avoids the dreaded double write process of a two phase commit, since it can act with immunity right up until a single atomic write, and that is all.

Requiring a process to be alive across two events is magnificently harder than it being alive for a single event.
