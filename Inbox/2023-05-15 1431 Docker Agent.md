Be able to provide a wrapper to any docker image that on Dreamcatcher you can run it up, install or configure it any way you want, launch it, then send interactive commands into it, with resources controlled by what you purchased on dreamcatcher.  Almost exactly like AWS except should be much cheaper as it is consistently spot rates, and you can operate in hybrid cloud mode.

Fingerprint what the docker container often runs, so that spot notes can pull down those blocks of the docker image first, and can possibly opt to avoid downloading them at all.

Only requirement is that the docker container be deterministic.

Starting parameters should set the context of the engine, like system clock, entropy, etc.  Everything available in context should be as identical as possible, to enable compatibility with a wider range of containers.
