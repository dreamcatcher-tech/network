Set up the different strategies and appraise them for their goals.

This is a solver that has the ability to set up scenarios about different global structures, and then reason thru, step by step, how each thing imacts and outcome, and can propose different structures with different scores.  Then as questions arise, it goes down each path to see how far it gets, and may be able to cancel out some options, plus let you see the consequences of each path.

It can have a simple math model that understands how tax works, and can go thru each jurisdiction, and understands complexities like limits, exemptions, residencies, etc.

So if we have more than one person, we can get gains that meet requirements in novel ways, rather than a single person trying to solve things.  These theories can be proposed and pondered over by anyone, and we have a solver that automatically weights it up.

Also extract out the novelty of any suggestion, so the same novelty can be generalized, and then applied to future solutions.  The solutions then would be all the tricks we know, applied to the unique rules of a given situation, better than any person can, and incorporating a wisdom of the tax optimization crowds, whilst allowing novel idea exploration.

Capturing the novelty means we can respond to jurisdictional changes rapidly / instantly, and can set up global gantt charts of when certain regulations will change, and therefore when a certain plan will become more effective.

We could connect these systems up and combine with tailored economic advice, so the subscription / usage is relatively cheap, but acts as top of funnel to get economic advice, where the person has played with the AI model, and we have provided advice to the AI model so the person can keep on playing, and can ensure their privacy.

Tool can help you play with investment scenarios that minimize impact whilst meeting risk goals.  Also can act as a marketplace to show you investment options that the wolfpack has scrutinized and some have gone in on, to reduce costs due to multiple due dilligences, since we are sharing all that.

Takes advantage of the fact that globally, there is always a jurisdiction that will treat you well enough and not charge you tax.

Also shares all the compliance checking for each plan, where the modules are checked, and if you want to receive assurance, you just pay the assurance fee and then we will back you up if you get in trouble for using this scheme.  Otherwise we can pay to do the research, and offer the assurance but not require it.  Or, give assurance to just the commissioning member.
