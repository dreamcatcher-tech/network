This would give us our topic switch detection live, and also visually show topics, and show theoretical next topics that the machine shows, where it shows how the knowledge chunks can be linked to the broader knowledge graph.

Then a topic switch is obvious in the thread, we can instantly form new threads and not lose context, so we can start a follow up thread from any given point with the given atoms passed in, we can load up more related atoms to increase the chat.

Its almost as tho we can run chat purely on these graphs, and include the nearby things too as a sort of RAG system.  Then teach the bot how to ask for more info on a particular thing, so it can walk the graph.
