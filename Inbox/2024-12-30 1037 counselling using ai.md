So two people talk to each other, and then the bot chimes in with red flags for the communication styles each person is using, categorizing them as a particular fault.

Individuals can add their own faults in.

The faults can be shortcut with simple names.

The bot can also act as a judge, to reinforce either side.

The bot can ask questions, or highlight things it is not clear about.

It can have the side effect of diverting attention away from the fight, and allowing each person to explain their position to the cold smooth logical bot.

Over time the bot builds up context that gets used in follow up sessions.

Can answer questions later, in private, as you ask it about certain things.

Sometimes you can change its programming, as you find out things that are faults and should be watched out for later.
