have a voice model that you can ask:

"what's the task status ?"

and it should be able to look at all the running tasks and know.

this means we need a central place where this can be read from.
be like a project management type of waterfall thing.
a central report on the computer workloads happening right now.

this implies we need a git repo to store all this on.
