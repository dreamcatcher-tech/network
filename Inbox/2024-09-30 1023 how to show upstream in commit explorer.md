Dedicated button to go to parent ?

Show the path we are currently on ?
Always include 

Select a particular branch to make it the main branch, and favour all of its commits, rather than those of its peers.
Focus button to show only commits from that branch, and exclude all others.

Children show in a dropdown, since it need not be expanded all the time.


Menu popovers that let you pick the child branches.  With max height selectors.

When select something on a branch, the breadcrumbs change to represent that branch, and the children show up.

Breadcrumbs for parents, so we only have to fetch the options for the currently showing path ?

What if the branch doesn't have an `.io.json` file ?  
We can always list children using the head paths in the db.
So there is io children and git children.

Stack these components, since we do not need them all at once, and it can be frustrating to have them all.
The control of this should be up to the AI to select for you, but you could manually control it too if a control widget was always rendered, that gave control to the human as to what bits to turn on and off.

Scroll into view seems difficult ?
