Or read a bunch of them, and search for specific examples.

At the same time, modify my starting query to be more specific based on what it found.

Almost like general purpose browsing, but when it detects we're on a ghissue search, it flicks in a napp that specializes in this.

Then we always want to link to our own base of parsed data - data that burned a lot of tokens to get its quality up.

This base of knowledge is owned by users, and it is specific to our platform, and it is in highly concise plain text.

Ideally bots would search this first, since this is our clean and verified data.  People can stake against this data, earn when its useful, slash when they're wrong.

Bots are trained on this data, and should be answering natively.

Could use that to seek out dev problems that people are having.
