When connecting napps together, foreach allows us to amplify things.

So a pipeline can be constructed that does heavy functions in parallel.

Simple example is generating a range of image prompts, and then generating the results.  This would be done by calling the multiplier function that would fork out a number of branches.

When it finishes, we need to get all the results back, plus intermediary results.
