If we operate a platform that induces higher quality and lower fees due to market forces, then we take a cut of thruput, then the consumers have not paid for for less service - they have paid less than they were for more than they used to get, and we took a cut of that.

Us getting paid means they got more for their money than ever before.  This is a wholesome business model to operate.

Ideally we want to be on mental health peoples phones, as a companion app, made fun by someone who emptathises well with them, with known good data policies, and a way to signal for help if the person wants it.

Govt apps are good for following licensing terms, rather than small foreign businesses who can easily hide.  So a non GPL shared source license should prevent us being stolen from.
