I should be able to make a CLI type interface that runs in the web that could give me the multiple dimensional artifact control going through repos, branches, commits, all those types of things The prompt should be nice and pretty like some of the ZSH shells do forget and as well an AI should be able to generate commands based on my prompts so if I just type some English and it isn't actually a command then an AI will intercept that and will say something about what it thinks I wanted and then it will enter in a command for me to enter

This could run on the local terminal and have access to local files, but it could also run in the webpage.
