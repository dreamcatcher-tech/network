Dreamcatcher should start as a platform that allows 3rd party audit of pricing and work for jobs inside a company.  It should facilitate switching of 3rd parties to supply so that nobody gets locked in, and that pricing stays close to market.

This can be applied to IT services via [[OpenIT]] where the system acts as a switching platform for IT services.  Ensures that projects in the company are completed in a timely fashion, by those of good reputation, using well scrutinied solutions.  It can manage ensuring the infrastructure is stored as code, and that documentation is kept up to date.  It handles rollbacks and patches.

Finally, this principle can be applied to staff.  By making a company that has the employment relationship with staff, they can supply those staff to companies via an API.  Firing for performance is easy, and the price of holidays and sick pay is built into the staff cost.  The staff are encouraged to find automation solutions for the companies, and will earn royalties for those solutions if adopted.  They are encouraged to outsource the work of the company and ultimately find a specialization where the company workstream is fully packetized and outsourced.

Poor performance is handled by this company, and if a staff member gets removed from too many jobs, they are dismissed for their performance.  Legal costs are built into the price.  We require that we can swap out staff members periodically, which means we need to define the roles clearly for our people.
