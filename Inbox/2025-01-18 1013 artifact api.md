When the napp receives artifact, it comes in bound to the latest block already.

The provider interface is not scoped, and requires all the args to come in scoped

So the runtime is a bit of a curried interface atop the provider.

But then git-fs is the files interface, too ??

Providers would make the scope object be first, and it would have some properties required.

lineage and files should be implemented separately ?
