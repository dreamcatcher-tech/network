When the napp receives artifact, it comes in bound to the latest block already.

The provider interface is not scoped, and requires all the args to come in scoped

So the runtime is a bit of a curried interface atop the provider.

But then git-fs is the files interface, too ??

Providers would make the scope object be first, and it would have some properties required.

lineage and files should be implemented separately ?

Might need to group the interface options by what scope each function call needs from its provider ? this might provide a more compact way to link the artifact interface to the provider ?

Maintaining two separate but related provider interfaces seems ok, since we get degrees of freedom between the two.
