This could be used to store layers of images, where each layer can be some custom code that we need to run in a sandbox.

So while they are playing, they are editing the mutable layer on the container.

Once they want to scale it, then it gets written to the layer ?

Or the container boots, and pulls in the git layer into ram ?
