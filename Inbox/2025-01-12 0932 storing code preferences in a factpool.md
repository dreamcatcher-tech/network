Lots of little rules can be created by the people, and then stored in a pool that the bot runs over anything that it generates.

First the bot generates to solve the pure problem - its flop.  This is always the highest quality output it will ever make, and all subsequent steps are presentational refinement.

Then it goes thru the fact pool and checks if any of those facts require changing the flop.

Then when the human interacts, it tries to extract out changes to the fact pool for future improvements.  It can also go thru all the old code using these new rules and refactor it all.
