I should be able to just speak about the notes I'm trying to take, and then bots go find the most relevant place to put that topic.  And tidy it up.  And update any nearby topics.

This could be done on the surface component, using o1 as the resoning tool.

If this was voice, then could use realtime voice, and prompt it to ask only one question at a time.

It could, in text, be generating questions and ranking them, then I can read those and interupt at any time, or it can asks omething in text so I can add to it.
