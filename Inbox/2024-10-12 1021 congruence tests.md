When we test artifact, we are making some assumptions about how the AI responds.

Intelligence is unpredictable, hence why it is valuable - predictable is a machine.

We need to supply back a test napp, which has tests that we expect to match up with what our mocks are in artifact.

? Could the artifact tests use a napp, and the napp itself holds the mocks inside ?
