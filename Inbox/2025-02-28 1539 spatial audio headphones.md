When I'm sitting at my desk, what I would like is the headphones have an accelerometer in them as well as some sort of basing function or homing function. If it knows that I'm sitting, it can kind of loosely recalibrate, but the point is that the audio should change - the speakers should be fixed in the room. So it's not like when I turn my head the audio moves. It should give me a feeling of things actually being in my physical space. Even if I'm moving or walking, it should pick up places for the speakers and move them around with me, turning them gradually to be in different places as I move.

If I get phone notifications or something, a type of notification or a type of sound should be related to a particular spatial position so I can always sort of know. It's almost like I need to set up a home area and I can position my notification in that area to help me pick them out amongst any background noise or anything like that. It can also know where I'm predominantly facing - if I'm always looking at my computer it's going to know that my head is often in the same location, so it can lay out a virtual room based on this information.
