agents would be backed by a folder of files that hold their information.

tar files are just a portable filesystem.

so an agent would be introduced to a system by way of a napp config file.

the agents working memory could be just a fork of their filesystem, or some dedicated place on the attached repo filesystem.

One use case is inserting stucks lookups in the reasoning steps so the model is agentically looping over all the knowledge of the platform.

people should be able to fork the agent and modify and test easily.
