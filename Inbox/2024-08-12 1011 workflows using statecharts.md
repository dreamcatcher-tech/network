Using the schema restrictions, we could force the model to output valid xstate machines ever time.

Using step by step reasoning, give very precise little updates to the state machine.

Use statechart viewer widget to show the exact statechart, or render in mermaid.

Can also keep the context changes updated using a schema, so that variable updates are well defined.
