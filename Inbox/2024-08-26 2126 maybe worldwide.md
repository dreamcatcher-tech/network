If a token has a listing, maybe a separate venture can be set up to find worldwide utility for this thing, and maybe that can be separated from the physical place itself ?

Could we piggy back on the existing listing perhaps ?

Making the island be a base for ventures, with regulation and compliance.

Could run a node of the dreamcatcher, which is a segmented version of the software.  This would manage the token and the usage, as the DAO.
