If you have some tasks to do, then the regional machines can act as a local gateway.

Ideally if you want to do some processing, then we would transport your process to this location, and run it with very low latency, before them bringing it back.

So how that might look with an example of OpenAI is that the user might want to do something in some faraway country. We recognize that there's a bit of work that needs to happen going back and forth with OpenAI. The process is moved to a data center that's close to the OpenAI endpoint. This work is performed going back and forth with very low latencies. Finally, the new state of the app is shipped back to the original customer region to continue processing with low latency back and forth to the customer or whatever other services they have running. 

The key blockchain piece is being able to transport whole processes into a different location because we can snapshot the state.
