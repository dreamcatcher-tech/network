If we have multiple browser tabs running for web clients of different messaging platforms, then we can provide a unified messenger service.

We should supply our app, which has this unified system, then allow a hosted browser version that runs on our servers, so the user can control these using the interface.

When the web apis change, or break, we should be able to fix them automatically, as well we should offer prizes for people who do the fix, by guiding our bots thru different fixes, so we should be very rapid in that much work is done by AI, and the rest is raced to completion by humans.

As soon as a change is detected in the web frameworks, we trigger.

The purpose is to be a frontrunner waiting for the EU to open up.

Plus we are a native chat app in our own right, with self sovereign data, and AI assistance being native.
