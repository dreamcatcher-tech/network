Talk with LP about how to ingest his list of inventions and ideas.  This purpose is to find what parts he needs to be able to trust us to induct his data.  Proves the point about sovereignty of data.

Talk about how to make a bot that captures his knowledge.  We would open the mechanics of it, then allow his proprietary data to be stored there.  Then allow him to manually tweak up parts of the system as a service - intelligent oversight.

Then mint NFTs for each idea.
