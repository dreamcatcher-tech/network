fly.io reduces costs by making things less complicated and exposing bare metal.

but it might be possible to lower costs even further if ai was making much of the hosting decisions, like load balancing, like servers up and down, like upgrades.

So an ai run hosting environment should be incredibly cheap compared to other places, as the ai place would start to approach raw hardware costs.

We could measure the margin opportunity by thinking about how much is added to raw hardware purchase prices for all these suppliers.
