Prompting how to make good images is hard, so we should make a bot do it.

We might want to make a fine tuned model to do this well.

Also make lists of prompts so we can generate variations.

For multiple image generations, like when the IP Adapter setting in octo.ai is at various levels, we can generate these in parallel.

We should be able to have a comparator run for how to achieve ip transfer on a range of different settings and approaches.  Offer prizes for increasing the score value of these tests.

We should be able to have people talk about these topics, and immediately have example napp output to show, which people can intercept and play with themselves.

Do grind generation, where the output is fed back into a vision aware model, and the differences are written out, then o1 comes up with a plan to update it, then it loops again.

It checks itself to ensure it hasn't run afowl of any loop limits.

Put a dump of helpful input as to how to prompt a certain model.  Then some examples, and then a format, like calling o1 to generate the best thing, or ask more questions to get clarity.  Also generate a range of prompts, run in parallel to see how they go.

Purpose is that as new image generators become available, the napp should be taught how to do the prompt engineering for you, and can give examples of the outputs when different outputs are made, and can draw on a library of examples to show how different prompts affect things.  So you can ask questions, and it can look up the library, or generate test images and add them to the library, which gives faster responses.

o1 can then help you reason about the changes you want and have a go at tweaking your prompt, and you can watch it work.

The visual show of it grinding thru options would be better than text since it is easier to understand its progression than raw numbers of text.  But if we had some running progress bars or score cards, that would work too.

Shows how multistage calculation gets you closer to your goal.
