Its hard to know how saturated a given computer will become.
We can use stats to take a guess at what the process will do.

But ultimately, if a node is saturated, we can hand it off in whatever state its in to another process.

After a commit, we can then move the next step of the execution to something with more capacity.

Even mid process, we can kill it and restart it elsewhere. 

If it was making side effect requests, this should be avoided.
