Because these models appear to be able to solve engineering math problems like free body diagrams and force diagrams. We might be able to get them to drive CAD models where they simplify the model down to simple engineering calculations, those that a conventional human in the 1960s might have done.

In this way, they can ask for studies to be done on a particular part where they think the answer is roughly around some area. They run the study to calculate the output of varying the parameters of the different things. When these study results come back, they pick the ones they like and move on. 

Is able to generate a part that meets the overall spec by repeatedly looping and refining under the guidance of a human, thinking about the problems in a combination of 2D space and algebraic space, and getting feedback from calculators that report on what they're doing. Furthermore, modules can be inserted that do things like generative modeling or the construction of 3D printed parts, where those parts are the result of subtracting pieces of a solid that don't make any difference. And so we get very organic looking shapes.

It can also use the feedback from manufacturing so it can modify the part designs to suit the manufacturing process. The availability of local materials, turn-around times, and other such things so we can reliably change the design based on the environment and whatever we have at hand. This is a superior model compared to producing a finished part or a finalized part that is adaptive and can generate variations to suit different needs in a seemingly infinite number of input combinations whilst at the same time learning from the device's performance in the field. 

Lastly, taking that learning in the field and deducing meta-knowledge about how to better instrument devices and how to deduce basic principles or rules that always seem to work, that sums up knowledge spread over many millions of trials, a form of advanced evolution as it were.
