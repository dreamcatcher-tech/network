be a platform to use the broker concept across the board.

there are specific brokers for different services, like insurance, mortgage.

We should make a platform that was for all of them, where the customer is ours, and we select and work with the best brokers to get the best deal.  We also know the commission rates being paid, so we can make that transparent and we can share it back to the customer, so they get even cheaper rates.
