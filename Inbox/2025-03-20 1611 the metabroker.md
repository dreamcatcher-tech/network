be a platform to use the broker concept across the board.

there are specific brokers for different services, like insurance, mortgage.

We should make a platform that was for all of them, where the customer is ours, and we select and work with the best brokers to get the best deal.  We also know the commission rates being paid, so we can make that transparent and we can share it back to the customer, so they get even cheaper rates.

Also turn every day people into brokers, so they can earn money for referrals to brokers, and no obligation to buy.  So the leadgen gets paid for.

Also we should try to map out the whole world, expressly, where each interaction, each advertisement, builds out this base model.  Then people pay for access to it, and in doing so they grow it, but we never give away the full model.
