If we have an app that uses all the crypto and integrity checking that comes with Artifact, then we should be able to provide a very secure password manager in a self sovereign way.  We can offer backups of their data, or they fully have their data.  We can offer recovery options as an isolated separate service, or they can handle this themselves, or they can set up friends who can all vouch for the recovery to occur.

LLMs can trace interactions of these friends with the person and determine if they might be hostile.

LLMs should be sitting atop every interaction and classifying hostile interactions.

This app can grant apps access to keys on a per request basis, and can generate keys and email addresses unique to each service you want to access.

Should be built into the fabric of Artifact as the credentials manager.

Should be able to integrate with all major credentials managers.

So basically once you authenticate with this app, that should be the only thing you need to do.

Can put a spending LLM in place so you have to justify each purchase, and consider the options presented to you before purchasing each thing.  Can require multiple approvals if you need the rest of your team to be okay with it.

Can use an encryption format that is the same as for encrypted pulses, but with very high work requirements on these pieces of data.
