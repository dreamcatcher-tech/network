use soundhound or other api's to do song recognition.
use AI to generate nice tidy album descriptions.

Use torrent scrapers or others to pull down the audio, and ensure it matches correctly.

Offer an integration with youtube api, but allow users to hook up any connection they like, including their raw files on their computer.

Let them serve files to their peers for a fee, and ensure the artists are getting a fair cut.

The android app could make lots of shortcuts on the desktop that can instantly engage some base functionality, like immediately start listening to do song recognition.

Could also just run it constantly and periodically thruout the day.
