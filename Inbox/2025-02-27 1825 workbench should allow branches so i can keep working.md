Whenever I'm working on analyzing some files, I don't want to be disturbed by the machine modifying things on the fly. So I should be able to ask for a bunch of changes that I want and have them run off in separate branches, so that I can keep working on the stable version that I see, which might be unrelated to the changes the AI is working on.

Once they're completed, I can get the AI going to deal with doing a merge of the things that I like. I could even ask for multiple versions or trials so I can see which one I like. When I review these things, they should actually be whole commits as opposed to me doing git commits as a separate operation. It's like my review of the AI's changes should be the commit, that's what it is.
