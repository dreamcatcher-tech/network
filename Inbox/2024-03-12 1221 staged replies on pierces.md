Give lifecycle updates back to watchers.
So like, when it has been received by the edge, when it has been included in the pool, included in a commit, which accumulation actions have been spawned because of it.

Once have the list of accumulations spawned out, can start watching these too, so can have deeper visibility in the execution tree that is occuring.
