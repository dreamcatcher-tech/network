SILD starts to look like what is needed for Mars, so the ability to show a metaverse version that accounts for cost and impact of all actions is required.  Also can act as a small version of what whole earth accounting can be.

Make a system to allow messages and other types of rich data to be sent to a given address, where the address definitions are based on ownership in Eth.  If you prove ownership, then you can control the DRE model of your home.

People can bid to build your home, and make equipment offers based on things you might need.

Metaverse familiar folk can spec out and order their homes from a distance.

Liquidity staking for public assets like roads - you stake into a pool that funds roads and then as it gets used, the pool earns a fee.  If you stake enough, you can get free use, or you can just pay the pool directly.  Maintenance decays the pool.  

Ultimately want to take the tooling and lessons and put them on a boat.

Component based visualization engine to allow complex operations to be added, and give a revenue stream for components.

Objects be included in multiple game interfaces - a distributed object like a sword can be used in multiple games.  So games become more like mashups.

Visualize the stake, so when people have committed funds to modules, can see that visually, so the community can participate in metaverse first, just like how things would need to be done on mars.

Authenticate NFT holders by getting their address to sign something, then keeping tally of their address.  Lets you filter comments by only legit NFT holders, or holders of a certain size / area.  Go to an SSL webpage, generate a metamask sign request, then match this to your authenticated Dreamcatcher account.  The tally is kept updated live, so if you transfer an NFT, we instantly drop it from your account properties.  Citizenship is easily verified in this way.

Supply for furnishings and everything else required for living that can be metaverse designed, pool constructed with fund commitments made before delivery, then combined shipping with constant updates.

A way to run projects in a competition / escrowed model, rather than pushing any single outcome of anything - just a principle of how to run things.

License minting - roles and responsibilities get minted as NFTs with artwork, so the org chart is defined by the relationships between the tokens that are held.  Board can reallocate the tokens with some grace period.  Access control is related to the NFT tokens.

Medical evac - pay into a pool where the pool ensures a corridor for rescue is always available.
