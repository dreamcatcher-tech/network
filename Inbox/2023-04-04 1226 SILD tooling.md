Make a system to allow messages and other types of rich data to be sent to a given address, where the address definitions are based on ownership in Eth.  If you prove ownership, then you can control the DRE model of your home.

People can bid to build your home, and make equipment offers based on things you might need.

Metaverse familiar folk can spec out and order their homes from a distance.

Liquidity staking for public assets like roads - you stake into a pool that funds roads and then as it gets used, the pool earns a fee.  If you stake enough, you can get free use, or you can just pay the pool directly.  Maintenance decays the pool.  

Ultimately want to take the tooling and lessons and put them on a boat.

Component based visualization engine to allow complex operations to be added, and give a revenue stream for components.

Objects be included in multiple game interfaces - a distributed object like a sword can be used in multiple games.  So games become more like mashups.

Visualize the stake, so when people have committed funds to modules, can see that visually, so the community can participate in metaverse first, just like how things would need to be done on mars.

Authenticate NFT holders by getting their address to sign something, then keeping tally of their address.  Lets you filter comments by only legit NFT holders, or holders of a certain size / area.  Go to an SSL webpage, generate a metamask sign request, then match this to your authenticated Dreamcatcher account.  The tally is kept updated live, so if you transfer an NFT, we instantly drop it from your account properties.  Citizenship is easily verified in this way.
