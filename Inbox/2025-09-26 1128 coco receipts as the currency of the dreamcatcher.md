having a made up currency is a bit stupid, and that gig is up.

instead, what we could do, is have compute receipts be tradeable.

So there is no underlying currency, but receipts for computing provide a natural currency.

It is the thing we purchase from the mainchain, and it is the benefit we supply to the world.

we can be used to track and hold other assets, like gold, eth, whatever else, but the intrinsic currency is the cocomark.

the system can start with no money in it.  Jobs go in, and people do them for free.  This produces cocomarks, which are the receipt that some hardware did some calculation in service of the mainchain.

Later, these receipts can be traded.

receipts can be bundled up into a batch, so they fit inside bigger denominations, making trading them easier.  These are predefined buckets that hold a fixed value of compute proof.

the receipts must be from the main chain, showing that the jobs were switched around, so you couldn't just do jobs for yourself, receive all the benefit, and then get the results back too.

they kind of hold value, in that one unit of compute is still the same, years on.

we can have the main chain do some time honouring choices ?
like skimming and inflating slightly, to make holding be a benefit.

storing data can be used as a currency too.

availability should be rewarded / mined too.

latency / edge metrics.

If the currency has multiple dimensions, and we can add more on later, and we have some trade rates between them, we are future proof.

can be like a debt that the chain owes you.

the platform skim is the loss where you can't trade 1:1 you'll get like, 10:9 or something - so for providing x units, you'll get x - y redeemable.

this debt is what can be traded around the place, and sold for real world currency.
