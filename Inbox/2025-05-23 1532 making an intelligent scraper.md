there is no need to make a concrete scraper.  all scraping should be dynamically figured out.

basically pull in a snapshot of the dom, and figure out where the video or whatever you want to extract is located.

run inside an agent to verify you extracted correctly.

worst case do raw screengrabs to make up the video again.

get more advanced at tap the byte stream that begins when the page loads.  Basically no matter what gets done, we can build up a shareable library of tricks to handle anything, and to dynamically respond when it changes.

we could have a version of yt downloader that is instantly updated by an AI any time there is a change.
