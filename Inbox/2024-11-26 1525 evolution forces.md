seems something underneath everything is that success in a small arena leads to success at a big arena. 

Eg: the evolution of skulls.  Taking knocks from all directions has been useful.  Taking knocks that are small caused us to be able to take increasingly larger knocks, which allowed for an iteration on this version.

And so all these little corrections seem to add up.
