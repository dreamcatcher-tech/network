Currently health provider records are fragmented.  Clients do not have access to their records

Free practice management software but in exchange we have a services marketplace, customers have their own records, and customers can search for alternate providers on our network.

Customers can drive practices to use these systems by communicating with them thru the platform with custom email addresses and phone numbers.
Can get second opinions on all your medical results and treatments.
Common things like bloodtests - we will transcribe them from paper format if you wish.

Benefit is getting access to this data and training diagnostics on it.  If clinicians use our tooling to enter their interpretations, then we can train on that dataset.  For cases where the data models and trained models are large, we can offer a service to interpret the images.  Particularly if they are private images.
Clinicians get attribution too.

Gone are the days of selling the software for the softwares sake - access to the customer and to the data is the value to surface and to skim.  Forming a marketplace where the customer can take their data anywhere is key, even internationally.  The right to message the client and the right to suggest things to them are golden.

Having all this past data means we can scan for new cures and disease signals when this new wisdom becomes available.  Can let people scan the images and guarantee that they didn't siphon off your personal data due to the containment mechanisms we run.

Customers can control how they filter offers, but each offer can be targetted to their exact preferences, like locality, etc.  They should be able to book an appointment with just an acceptance of an invite to one.  They should be able to receive wholistic advice across all their data, remotely.  Just like robot wealth managers took off, so it should be the same with health.

The biggest value of health data is accessing it all at once, so that connections can be discovered.  Currently the specializations cut arbitrary lines that make integrated health difficult.

### Eye images database 

For optometrists, they take photos of the eye each visit - these live primarily on their computers, and have a wealth of information.
Attribution if your data contributed to a breakthrough.
