As your chat progresses with the tool, it should be maintaining this short list of checks that it will do, as well as your feedback, plus watching how you use the app. It would learn how to make a list of checks, group these together under features, and start playing these off rapidly in parallel every time there's a change.

When you ask for one thing, it checks that everything still makes sense. The check is not working properly, or something. Your chats are almost self-healing. You say what you want, you might get told you can't have that because it conflicts, but also we should be able to hold long-run sense a lot better because the chats with the UIs seem to deteriorate or destabilize the longer the run gets. With this checklist plus these AI agents that check off each item, we should be able to make looping changes that hold very accurately to what the user wants and can keep more requirements in mind even than the user can.

Watching the user actually use the app and regular users use the app because there is no difference between dev time and build time now. They can sample what's being done and add those types of tests to their exercises. Then start to comment on how any particular exercise could be made more efficient or faster. These suggestions would come to you by way of some simple note suggestions, but also it would attempt to build a prototype that had these things included in it that you could just look at and discard if you wanted.
