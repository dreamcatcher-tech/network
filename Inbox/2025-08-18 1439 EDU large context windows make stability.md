If your planning capacity is very narrow, then the switchability is necesarily very quick.

people with big context windows have increasingly stable thought, since switching is less likely, as they have many things to consider, which impedes / loads their thinking.

If the small window gets stuck, need a breaker - something of a different mode, possibly phsyical, to get it to switch to something else, which makes it easy to switch to a third thing, since the second thing was not strong enough on its own.
