Speed really helps.

Use groq for whisper conversions.

Also use it for some code generation tasks, since super quick ?
Can be used as first stage for a pipeline, where we take the groq output and feed it in to o1 or others so they at least have something to bite on.

Just try not to influence the outcome, since the o1 models should be able to choose a different approach.

Is providing a file with content going to distort the output of the model as it tries to bend to what already exists ?
