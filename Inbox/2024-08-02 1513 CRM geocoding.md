We could open google maps up in an iframe in search mode, so they can use a familiar interface.

Would be best to use a familiar interface and just get results back, rather than trying to bulk geocode.

Finding existing ones would be a query to walk thru the db, then load the page doing a search, and show the page so the human can just click ok on it.

Or use a simple geocode api, and get the AI to interpret the results so it can try fix everything possible.
