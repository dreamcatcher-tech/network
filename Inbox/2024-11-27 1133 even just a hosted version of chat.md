This would make $x per month.

Selling compute for people running heavy models would be useful.

Jobbing work to produce little bots for people.

stuck loop being a way to uncover bot problems and inject the fixes in.

Having NFTs and blockchain related security over what gets said and when.

Can learn about what features people want.

Basicaly provides a place to unify communities around solving these problems.

People make and sell bots.

People use our stores to put all their files, and to share files with others.

Using blockchain, we can reliably operate long running agents, or swarms, like a DAO.

You can make your own, you can improve others, and get rewarded for it.  Can share your chats and have them used for training too.

The issue is if someone is already making a front end, and they have commercialized it, then it becomes hard to slice something in.  However our revenue model might be good for them.

Front end is hard, but backend is where the innovation occurs.

Tools is just napps, where you pull different ones in and learn about them.  Plus your agents can learn about the tools by chatting with them.

Gives us a way to handle the influx of issues that these areas create, so the front end would need to be managed using dreamcatcher to build it out.
