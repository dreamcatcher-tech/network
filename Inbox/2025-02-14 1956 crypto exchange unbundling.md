Theory is that with AI based admin, and changing compliance, we can be cheaper to operate and fully compliant compared with binance.

Identity management could use facial recognition to log you in, so you need to log in with the passport, then pass a verification against the passport, but from then on, to log in, you have to pass the facial check, and it needs to be different every time.

To verify location, get them to walk down a main street, and we'll lift off signals about the location in ways that cannot be spoofed.

Mail out a cheap NFC card with challenge auth, so we have their address as well as a means of proving.  Plus very cheap.

Sounds like the best way to stop fraud is that the device that does the kyc needs to be the same as what is transacting, to avoid account transfers.  So we hard lock to a physical device.  Can open up a new device by doing an NFC passport scan that has strong challenge.

Basically you can't use a new device unless you scan your passport.

This locks the devices secure enclave and the passport together.
