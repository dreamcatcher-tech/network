If we hosted services and products made using dreamcatcher attribution, these would be signalled as being dreamcatcher native, and so if people want to consume things with the dreamcatcher principles / way, then they come to this marketplace to do that.

It is hybrid, in that other things can exist on this marketplace, but the speciality is that it is able to be dreamcatcher native, full stack - so even the hosting fees and software makers get paid.
