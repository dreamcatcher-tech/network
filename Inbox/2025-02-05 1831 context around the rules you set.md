Each rule should be tied to an experience you had, so you say what happened and what you didnt' like, then we set up the rule for you.

This rule might only apply to some models, and some contexts.

Basically when you set your preferences, you shouldn't have to give raw prompts, we should help you.

Then you can say that you want to broaden or narrow when each rule applies.

We can make many of these rules be second pass, so we get the model to flop the code solution out first, and then we do a transform to make it presentable.

We should store the flops separately, and use those as predicted tokens.
