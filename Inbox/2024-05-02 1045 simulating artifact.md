The basis is this home concept, and machine ids.  We should be able to generate simulations using NL actors to operate inside the system as children.

The base environment would be a chain

So perhaps the base environment key needs to be set in Artifact at deployment, then everything else treated like it is in a simulation ?

The principle is to make as few exceptions as possible to the rules of the system in order to boot environments.
