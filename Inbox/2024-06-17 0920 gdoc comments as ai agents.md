When collaborating with someone you are trying to reach consensus on a gdoc.

So passing comments back should propose edits that an AI generated for you.

when viewing the comment or diff of the change, you can see a summary of why it was made where the AI has summarized the motives behind what it did.

These motives can form a doc outline, or doc reasoning, which is a set of requirements that is built up representing the document.

Want to state the facts and let people stake on those facts, so we know the context of what is being done.  These facts could point to the knowledge base of the org, and could highlight or summarize and link to facts in the pool that have been transformed to suit the current purpose.

Splitting out into a new doc should be trivial, where we are trying to generate a collection of proposals, and so we are always watching the overview of all the proposals in the batch.
This batch would be continuously live with various participants viewing and changing these proposals.

We would need to simulate such a system so we know it is able to handle various actor modes.  Be able to jump in to any simulation, fork it, and then act as a real human.
