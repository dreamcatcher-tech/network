whenever people want to make issues, or change docs, then 

the project had a large software component, so we need this technology to be at our foundation, actually - we never had a system of record.

here is our system of record.

asking questions can cause the creation of an FAQ - if you ask duplicates, the questions and answers do not get modified.  Silly questions go straight in there.

During calls, we can put those questions in there and have bot make its decisions.

We can co collab on building up this ai.

We can keep prompting it with the same questions over and over - what is the best thing to do for all the NFT holders ?
