If we set up the mask with several buttons on it, which could be programmable by the words you say into it. The buttons could be for a protocol (e.g., phone or desktop) or some other thing. If the mask was merely trying to get to the internet, it would use whatever Bluetooth connection granted this access. Once on the internet, it would redirect the transcription however it was configured to do so. There would be agents on phones or different apps on different phones that it would be aware of, as well as a desktop. Those agents were able to receive the broadcast and do as they were programmed with that incoming data. This means that complex workflows could be made, such as a transcription going into a desktop app that also pauses the phone music, so that the swarm of devices acts as a single group. All of them are aware of each other's status, and it can be all centrally controlled.
