DVRs are expensive, and hard to back up.
If we stored the video in backblaze, then we could save a lot on a storage appliance being on site.
If we additionally could do large scale intelligence processing of the video feeds, and provide a chat based interface to let it be controlled naturally, this would be useful.

Then allow it to integrate with other chat based programs by providing triggers, or doing further steps, so it can integrate with more functions, like door controllers, give individuals access to video that appears to be them, allow anyone to set up triggers when it sees someone.
