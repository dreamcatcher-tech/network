If we set a file to display on the stateboard, like a test spec, then we would want to notify the bot if it changed.  Showing in the stateboard is a way of indicating file focus, and an individual file focus would be viewing a single file, and if it changed while being focused, the chat would be notified about it in the next prompt the user put in, as a side note / system prompt.

Changing dir would be mentioned too as part of the system prompt updates, so that the assistant knows next time it goes to do something that perhaps it needs to re-read the file to get the latest version.

Dir updates can be given too, so a focused dir that has some changes, we can indicate what the changes were, and the bot can decide to do something with that.
