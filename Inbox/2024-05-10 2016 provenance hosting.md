like jsr but for hosting.

Can show how people have forked some hosting app and then started running it and can guarantee that nothing has changed from the publishers source, or from the dependencies from the jsr registry.

So instances that are running can promote themselves as genuine and fair.

This can replace facebook, since now everyone can have a genuine website with very little effort.
