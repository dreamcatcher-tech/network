In both domestic scheduling, or truck scheduling, participants would benefit from being able to ask questions of the calendar.  When am I on next ? how come x is happening ?  whens the next holiday ? can I take leave on date xyz.

Particularly when there is contention in coordination, where people want to swap shifts, book holidays, ask questions about different things, chat can help.

Further, helping for resources that haven't been hired, like gig workers, fill in nanny's, playdates.

Then unify it all, like rubbish collection, school holidays, road closures, weather.

Periodically a canonical version can be published, for printing, and then people can make amendments to it.
