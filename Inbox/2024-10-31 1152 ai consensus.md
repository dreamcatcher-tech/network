If multiple humans run the same API calls and a result is achieved, can it be said to be decentralized ?

the ai call doesn't matter, but it is simply a way to get an answer to something hard, like how much should each person get paid.

So long as there are disinterested parties that are running the computation, and agreeing on the outcome, for reasons that have nothing to do with your usage, that is decentralized.
