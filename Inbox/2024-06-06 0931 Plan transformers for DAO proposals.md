When a plan is put forwards, everyone looks at it from different angles.  A single document always falls short.  So we should be able to create template transformers that assess each plan from a certain perspective.

These transformers get more tuned by people over time, and shared between them as a way to view things thru the same lenses.

Can assess things like proposed drain on treasury, risk to reputation, and other such metrics.
