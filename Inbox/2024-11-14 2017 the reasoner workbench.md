Base knowledge is the requirement for any highly functioning AI system to function well, and to function cheaply.

three principles:
1. internal adversarial refinement of base knowledge based on the principles of reason
2. generative amplification of base knowledge into human detectable forms, like code, podcasts, webpages, chat sessions
3. refinement of base knowledge to pass multiple detections

There are some base rules for reasoning that get applied, and from there it is up to the persons speciality.  The base rules get refined as we learn more about what makes good reasoning.
