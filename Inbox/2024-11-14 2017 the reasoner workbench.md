Base knowledge is the requirement for any highly functioning AI system to function well, and to function cheaply.

three principles:
1. internal adversarial refinement of base knowledge based on the principles of reason
2. generative amplification of base knowledge into human detectable forms, like code, podcasts, webpages, chat sessions
3. refinement of base knowledge to resolve errors in the renders

There are some base rules for reasoning that get applied, and from there it is up to the persons speciality.  The base rules get refined as we learn more about what makes good reasoning.

Additionally, render in ways that match it to the external world.  Detect contradictions with the real world.  Create tests to verify the correctness of the knowledge base, and say which are assumptions and which are fact.

The process continues for multiple render loops.
And multiple people can submit errors in renders.
