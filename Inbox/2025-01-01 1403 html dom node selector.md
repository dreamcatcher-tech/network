If we can use the browser to highlight parts of the dom that we want to copy, possibly by using a paint technique, then we strip out those dom items and send that in to the bot to process, we can avoid wasted 

We can also strip out styles and scripts and images.

Might be able to use lynx browser.  This means we can have a tool already designed for making things text readable, and use this for the LLMs to drive.

The links we should signal somehow, and give the bot tool calls to be able to select links and navigate thru them in history.

We could run lynx in the browser as a widget, proxying thru the deno site.
