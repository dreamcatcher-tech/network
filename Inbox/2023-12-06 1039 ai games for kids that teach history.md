Engage in historical battles, playing with your friends, and learn the limitations that those of the time faced.  Game out alternate scenarios to encourage thinking about why things went the way they did.  Investigative gaming.

Play accelerated versions of world economy so we can see how things unfold, but not as boring as just absorbing information.

With the game focusing on key events in a curriculum, just by playing competitively with their friends, they should learn the history as a consequence, because it is limitations of the game.

Show how to relate these scenarios to modern day events.

Act as kings, or as serfs, and have immersive VR experiences so you can know about the objects available in a given day.

However boring one particular person in history is, if you multiply that person out enough it can be fun - so one serf might not be that interesting, but thousands together getting called up to war can be.

The geography of the maps becomes part of their general knowledge.

The AI should be able to say what they *should* know since they have been surrounded by this incendental knowledge a lot - like telling tales of piracy, invasions, colonization - it can go thru a given curriculum and say how much incidental exposure a player has had, and then correlate that to scores in a history test.

Should be able to generate a game for any given historical event, which can be equivalent to learning history, but in a much more engaging way.  Find other people gaming out the same history online.  Ask questions, win prizes.  Parents pay money so that some kids win prizes ?

Having a remarkable event with your friends bakes knowledge in more than just reading about it.

Parents can be shown what parts of the curriculum the incidental knowledge is spreading to.  Parents can steer the parts they want more.  Studying a book or playing in VR is about the same in terms of is the child getting exercise or whatever - but at least with VR they are gaining hand eye coordination, movement, and learning that is fun and addictive, not a chore that needs to be endured.
