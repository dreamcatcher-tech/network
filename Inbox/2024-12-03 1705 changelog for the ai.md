Welcome screen can show changelog buttons if things have changed since you last came in.

Show the raw changelog, but let it reason using the definitions for the UI and the platform, so that it can understand how all the pieces relate.

Buttons should allow a context switch to a new napp specializing in changelogs.

The changelog should be declared in terms of stucks.

Blend this with feature requests.

Let the user tag stucks they are interested in.

Track which ones they put money on, so we know to mention those first as they are more relevant to that user.
