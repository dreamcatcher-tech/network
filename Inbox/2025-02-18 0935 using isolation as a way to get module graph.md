Often we want to pull in other code of relevance.
Using our compartment system for code isolation, we should be able to generate an import graph by hooking the way the compartment loader works.

Then we can supply a graph where llms can decide on the context in a smart way.

web packages can be processed by the LLM to summarize their usage effectively.  This info can be shared so it doesn't have to be generated each time.
