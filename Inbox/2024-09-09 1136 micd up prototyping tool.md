be able to test new theories by using AI executed code, which may be slow, but can be used to measure enhancements in quality.

Dial up the psychometrics of the audience, and different activity levels, and gage the toxicity results.

Even if we supply synthetic agents and allow them to drive against their own tool to present metrics.

In effect mic'd up is vurtializing the number of participants, and holding it down at a low number.

They are also trying to reduce clustering effects.

In our models we can show where certain toxicity levels result in network failure / signal failure at what size, so people can play with that.
