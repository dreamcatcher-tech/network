Be like a 'save to dreamcather' button.

This would then put the raw dom into dreamcatcher, which can then process it for different purposes.

These urls can also be browsed by our scaping network.

Just snaps the dom.

We should copy the code from the pocket.com project, so we learn how to pull in the data from the pages.

Then, we can take the content, and make flashcards that you can browse, which include snippets of interest in your articles, and when you chat, it can correlate between articles you have saved, possibly that your friends have saved too.

So basically context grabbing is a big enough deal that we probably need that to be a core feature of our platform - the more you can get, and share, and the easier it is, the more useful the LLMs.
