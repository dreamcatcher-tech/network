guarnateeing that your data didn't leak is one thing, but the harder thing is to guarantee that if some other party, that required your data - to guarantee that they did not also leak.

if a data processor uses coco, you can know they didn't leak anything.

if say, your doctor needed to view your records, and so long as nothing left the coco, you can guarantee that too.

their coco's can anonymize your data, but it can also process your data in a way that is safe, since the image they use can be locked down, and audited to be secure.
