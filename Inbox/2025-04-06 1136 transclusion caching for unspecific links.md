If there is no hash assosciated with a link, then we cache on first read.

On subsequent reads, we can flag to the reader that a later version is available.

There are some many preferences that one could choose that this system should be configurable.

Backlinks are done using a registry or an inbox for each repo, since you don't want to see all backlinks as they might be spam.
