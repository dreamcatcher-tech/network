A mathematical model can be very complex, and so we might focus on individual pieces first.

A component would have a math expresion, some reasoning, some entities, and would define some relationships.

It would have a small piece of code that given some input parameters would output what the math formula said, so that it can be assembled into an experiment.

In a workbench, I should be able to select a subset of the concepts I want to model, and then explore each of these in isolation, to make them work as expected, before saving to be used in a higher level model.
