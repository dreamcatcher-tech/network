Every startup needs legal advice.

For a cut of revenue, we would guarantee that all comms going out, that we processed for safety, would be defended in court.

So we are in effect your legal spend, but we give you guarantees of defense and correctness, and we check everything.

So many companies have a gateway filter function that decides with skill what comms are acceptable to go out.

We would insert ourselves in the outbound message stream, with automated reviews, assisted by humans.

We guarantee the correctness, so if you get taken to court, we defend you.
You share the defense pool with other companies.

We can set up risk bearing entities for you, so they can have limited liabilities.
