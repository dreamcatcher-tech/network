it expects to be at a dedicated path.
We could wrap it in an iframe, so we can rewrite its requests ?

or we can give each instance a full path.

so if you come in looking for a particular view, then if it is a ttyd view, we need to add something extra to the path ?

the issue seems to be only what the page comes back with, and tries to make a path request.
