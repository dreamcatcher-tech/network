They should be able to complain about things in the app, and we would point them to the task that was being worked on to fix what they said.  They can attach their sessions, see others who had this issue, and be notified of significant changes.

Keep track of the complaints they made - these should be stored in the complaints repo, so the file structure is assured, rather than it being their personal storage ?

They can chat with others for things like seeing if they will put in money or effort, or ask questions about extra context.  The bot of each person would try to answer first.
