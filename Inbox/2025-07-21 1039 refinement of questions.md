leverage of questions.

Whenever I ask a question about something, the answers should be stored, since I would probably want to leverage that again later.

The fact that I poked at it means that I probably want to go in that direction, or at least use that knowledg.e

so asking questions should be deepening the knowledge base that will be drawn upon by the bot, rather than it relying on the same knoweldge base of everyone else.

It should be refining a curated list of nuanced points and information that it derives from the answers it finds to all my questions.
