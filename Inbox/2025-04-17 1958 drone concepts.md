A high-altitude drone could be used to kickstart a ramjet. The dropping of the device, if it would first be lifted there by a hydrogen balloon. Once it was in position, it would have a cone where it could strike upon and it could increase its downward speed by using hydrogen or other fuel in combination with a ramjet

The balloon itself containing hydrogen might be able to have a pump or something attached so that it can compress the hydrogen down so that it can take it with it, so that the hydrogen fuel is not weight that needs to be lifted up into space with the balloon, although the balance would depend on the weight of the pump versus the weight of sending up a much higher compressed canister of gas or some other fuel. 

An interesting use case of this is when a submarine surfaces - there's an amount of time it takes for the sub to be able to sink again. That time, if it was long enough, could be enough for a drone to drop from the sky, accelerate downwards and land. 

With internal cameras able to guide the drone when hitting a particular target, it may be able to steer itself with great precision, such as in the opening hatch of a submarine or the bridge of a ship. 

Using RamJet may also allow it to change its cone into something more like a bell so that it can have a greater horizontal range at a very high speed. 

Beared with this, a surveillance system that consists of stabilized cameras that can be pointed at certain things, as well as laser communications that are point-to-point communications, could build a form of surveillance and comms network using these drones, whilst also a platform from which to wait for making a strike. 

drone resale for anti piracy defense.  power and control and recovery is attached to the drone tether, then it has munitions, delivers, then returns or is pulled in.
