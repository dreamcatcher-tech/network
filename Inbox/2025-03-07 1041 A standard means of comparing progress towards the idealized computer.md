We need a way that we can compare ourselves and our competitors in a standard way, while at the same time being made aware of advances or other use cases that could alter what the standard ideal model is.

Once the model is defined and laid out, progress towards it and effort remaining can be charted, as well as benefits and economic incentives modeled and theorized about. At the same time, losses due to an ideal platform such as AWS or Microsoft Azure can also be modeled, and we can show revenue streams going into them and why we think that they are inefficient or lossy.
