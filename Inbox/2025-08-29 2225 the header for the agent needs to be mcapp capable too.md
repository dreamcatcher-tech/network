if the repo is the same and the trust level is the same, then we can reuse a container to run some apps.

this makes agents not really any different, per se, but they might have more built in tooling.

So the whole cycle is the same:
1. provision machine
2. boot machine
3. call machine
4. keep calling
5. shutdown based on job being done and resource idle.

So the infra presents as a mcapp to artifact.
