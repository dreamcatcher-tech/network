Give them a file listing of a project, as well as all its issues and prs.
Start at the entry point, and give it a tool that requests to read a certain file.

It would then be asked to evaluate what parts of the file were relevant, so that it can then have its memory reset, and at the point it asked for the file, it gets only what it found relevant, to keep the context low.

In this way, it walks around, pulling in data as it goes, then backtracking to only have the minimum it needs, and discarding false steps, but marking those steps as not useful.
