Can allow anyone to make an app using our prompting toolkit and GUI elements.  Can ask for help from experts too.  Users can raise issues in natural language, and can fork the apps and make their own tweaks which can also be published.

The GPU cost is why we can charge all users money and then split royalties.  So everyone has to pay to run the GPU, and so its easy to add a piece on top that says what the fair markup for royalties is.  This puts a version of GPT4 in charge of the pricing of the marketplace.

Such a rapidly evolving app space needs simple rules, and needs fairness, since there is just no way to keep up otherwise.  Also the recomposability is best for consumers, since nobody wants a billion subscriptions.

The end of SaaS is that there are so many apps you need that the model breaks apart and the vendors need to agree to an automated dispersal mechanism.
