in a massively distributed system, some of the git features, like writing HEAD, need to be abstracted out.

Doing a merge should require a lock on the target branch only.

Operations should be done using kv queue actions so they stay very light on the thread, have limitless scale.

Isolate scale is really about detaching from all the painful things we had to do to keep the cpu busy, or reuse our time.  Instead we should use a function like it was zero overhead to call, and so every piece of work we can possible get out should go into a funciton.

If we are unsure how many times a loop will be called, us a queue.  If we are unsure how long something will run for - use queue at each defined point of compute.

Try to align commits with queue actions

CPU is like employee - old way of programming a business was to keep the CPU busy.  Bursting up or down was very hard.  Also tracing was hard.  Modern company is like serverless functions model.
