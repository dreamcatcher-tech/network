Because of our integrations with git, if we were to host our own git service, and be able to run code that was specified in this gitlike way, with no cors proxy, and we could execute actions in a certified and low latency way, so our network would be the ideal hosting solution for apps on artifact.  Then we would work to make that decentralized, and have a public ledger version.  Then start bolting on AI services and other upgrades.

Banking on repeatable computing being a useful thing, that makes development faster and more reliable.

Push out the network using deno deploy, and allow people to replay and debug their errors with perfect fidelity.

So we'd have this worldwide network of low latency operations, and we'd back the heavy stuff with S3 and lambda functions.  If the function execution took too long, we'd signal that it needs to run on lambda and hoist it.  Debugging would show the attempt to run, and after too many attempts, this function was always run on lambda.

If we had multiple regions then the latency should be fairly small.

Seek to bundle payments and identity / login as a single service.  Devs using the service would get people to sign up to a single identity and payment gateway, and then they could focus on their app, but also they could share data with other apps so the users weren't bothered with double entry.  Add to this that apps are found by AIs on behalf of users, and growth should be phenomenal.

This would be a hypercomputer, where you control the hardware itself from inside your app, and then also manage user deployments.  The hardware is completely virtualized, so you can seamlessly switch to any provider.  People can pay some fixed low fees which can be used to run free apps, where the users energize the system, which is inverted from how the web is now, where users leech.
