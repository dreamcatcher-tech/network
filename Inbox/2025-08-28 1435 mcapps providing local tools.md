if a mcapp provided all the prompt and config needed to start an agent, including the runtime container reference, then if it also had some local tools, those would be installed along with the image if it got spun up as an agent ?

otherwise if it is running in mcp serevr mode, then it just provides those mcp tools regardless.

we definitely need an fs virtualizer.

mcapp then seems to be a way to define agents, so that they can be modular and moved around.
