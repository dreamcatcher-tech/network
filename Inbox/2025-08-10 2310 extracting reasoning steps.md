When tying to solve a long running task, coming at it with many ideas, and many threads of reasearch, it pays to try to extract out the rules of the system and the justification.

So if checking against artifact and a the modelcontextprotocol to see if they fit, a range of rules should be able to get extracted, so that when other things need checking later, this reasoning is baked in.

plus the models can think about how things should be a lot better.
