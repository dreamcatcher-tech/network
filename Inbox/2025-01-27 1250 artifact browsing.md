Use a headless browser service, like https://phantomjscloud.com/ to drive pages into the browser, and snapshot the dom.

Ideally we would save the complete state of the browser and page, so we could carry on like the browser never stopped.

browserless can get the text out of a page, as well as take a screenshot, as well as give the dom back.

Can be a simple URL call.

Have a live browser that multiple participants can use the page on, and everyones bots can speak with.
