if a mcapp exposed resources, then we could mount it so it remained permanently affixed under the resources tab ?

so the chat mcapp could expose a resource that listed what model providers it had available and some stats about its current usage.  

these would be naturally subscribed ?
or we just use the subscription system to trigger some updates in our state ?

the resources would be very useful for UI, particularly since we could display them reasonably dynamically, and make UI that grouped things together nicely based on a schema.
