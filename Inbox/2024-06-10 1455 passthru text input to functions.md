If a file attachment is used, we can pass it straight thru to an isolate.

If a separate text input window is used, like part of the stateboard, then we can pass things straight thru without the ai having to copy it into the function.

The AI can then wire up different functions, eg:
enter in a json schema doc
run the schema checker and get the ai involved if something needs fixing
