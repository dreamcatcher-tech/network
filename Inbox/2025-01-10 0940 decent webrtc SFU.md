allow deals where people can purchase peak bandwidth ahead of time, so if congestion will make things hard, some providers might sell dedicated slots in advance

The redudancy links could also be a form of TOR, so censorship resistant realtime streaming.

Have checkers in the streams that determine if a node did indeed do what it was supposed to.

If the hops were made to be super low latency forwarders, and hopefully can begin the forwarding before the packet has fully arrived, decreasing latency, particularly if there are many hops to be made.

If we ran our meetings using this model of a source that is always on, then we could make supercuts of voice messages we each left, plus replies that were async, plus we could have very short meetings that get aggregated.

So instead of a heavy broadcast, we can have very short broadcasts, and the bots cut them up an enhance what we say plus say something of their own.

This is a good avenue to go down, since the reliability of blockchains but also brought to realtime streaming seems gold.

Every venture always has the economic structure baked in to it, like conways law or something, and so having a clean and fair equity structure is key
