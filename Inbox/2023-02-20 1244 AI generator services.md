>[!danger] Depends: 

Offer open source services that use a large dataset or large gpu compute so that we can transparently provide this service to low resource clients for a market rate fee.  Should give good responsiveness, great pricing, helps secure the network, acts as pure GPU / compute demand.

People can easy swap out the dataset of the provider.
Can also pay to train the model better.
Usage data can be fed in to the models to give even better results.

Wrap closed source AI services in a unified fashion, so you can switch out providers easily, or combine results while keeping the same api, and also cache (possibly share) the results you paid for.

This can also help with uniqueness of prompt for AI generators.
