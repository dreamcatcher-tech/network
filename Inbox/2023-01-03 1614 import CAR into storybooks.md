Generate test data in nodejs.  Export the resulting chain approot into a CAR file.  Commit this to a public github repo.  When story loads, import the CAR from the github url, so can avoid time to create plus size bogging down the repo.  

Updating the data requires a rebuild into chain data, an export, then a push.
