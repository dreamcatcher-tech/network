while the agent is working, if it gets asked something it can't do, it can make an mcp call to switch itself out.  

This would be quite jarring at the moment since the whole ssh session would change at that point.

When they drop in to the new agent, it knows where they came from and it can read the info about the last chat.

show the previous agent in a shortcut on the left hand side, so the history of agents is present and you can go back to a certain agent at any point ?
when it hands you off somewhere different, this just inserts a new node on the list of recent agents / chats.

its not so much about the recent agents, but the recent chats, since the topic is what matters.
