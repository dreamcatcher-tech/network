as a host operator, you can optionally subscribe to various white lists and blacklists.

you can also subscribe to a authorities cooperative list, which can allow the authorities, without your knowledge, to access the machine in any way they deem fit.  An accreditor will bear witness, in private, to ensure they do not over-reach.

Do this is you want to combat crime.

you can also allow access to a trusted vigilante group, and scope the access to be just seeing the control plane, or sniffings various vms.  We basically give as much access as the hoster themselves has.

for network gateways, you can enable further cooperation levels, that can include dmca takedown notice processing.
