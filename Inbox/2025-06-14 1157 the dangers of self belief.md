when some technical people believe that they're doing things as good as they can, they can argue with those who are non technical an justify what they're doing.

having a network means everything can be refuted.

also ai watchdogs on work progress would solve this.

So anybody undertaking a technical project would probably prefer to manage using the dreamcatcher, since they could have ai assistance to debunk what the tech people are saying.
