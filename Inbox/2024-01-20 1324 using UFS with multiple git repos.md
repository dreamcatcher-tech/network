We should be able to combine the isolated filesystem work with the work to overlay multiple remote repos as one.  Ideally want to be able to edit the helps, even edit the isolates, and then have them run again.

If the git engine could be passed a list of things that had changed, that would greatly speed it up.

If the isolates were editable by the AI, and testable and uploadable, this would be super fun times.
