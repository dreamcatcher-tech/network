If we issue custom cards, then people can deposit funds using bank transfers or whatever other way they want, and then they can spend using these cards.

So they can spend what they have on balance, as well as any royalties.   Can optionally liquidate assets they hold so they can spend.

Might be easier to do this issuance thru wise?

Or at least do currency conversions using wise.
