>[!danger] Depends: 

unified action structure with stucks, transclusions
tree notion on soul branch
special self aware structures in git ?
widgets as a web page in a frame ?
context gobling views ?
If the I/O flow of naps resembles agentic messaging, then is agentic messaging really just putting a nap interface on a person? 
Why is agent good as a standalone thing rather than treating an individual napp as an agent? 
Why should all messaging go through a central channel for each actor? 
Is the way we're navigating to widgets good or acceptable? 
actor repos are an agreement with the platform, so they are run under the platform rules
orgs being special as a grouping mechanism ? like an actor, but acts as a container ? is that needed ?
how should friends work ?
should messages be able to be received from non contacts ?

friends widget
merge chats and agent messages ?
chat with an agent in the main chat window, possibly using the state board ?
messages are just like messages are now ?

show which messages the response captures, so we can have multiple responses go in, done at different times, then a final view that looks at both and combines.

have a connectors folder, where you can store ingested data, like your phone contacts list, email contacts list, etc.

Merged message queu seems key, where an agent curates the list for you, and does some processing, so you could get all the messages you want in there, or narrow it down, or form tasks / jobs out of each one.  
Jobs might be different to chats ?
