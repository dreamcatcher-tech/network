unified action structure with stucks, transclusions
tree notion on soul branch
special self aware structures in git ?
widgets as a web page in a frame ?
context gobling views ?
If the I/O flow of naps resembles agentic messaging, then is agentic messaging really just putting a nap interface on a person? 
Why is agent good as a standalone thing rather than treating an individual napp as an agent? 
Why should all messaging go through a central channel for each actor? 
Is the way we're navigating to widgets good or acceptable? 
actor repos are an agreement with the platform, so they are run under the platform rules
orgs being special as a grouping mechanism ? like an actor, but acts as a container ? is that needed ?
how should friends work ?

friends widget
merge chats and agent messages ?
