pass in a commit hash, and a path.
If a directory is passed in, a tree will be returned.
If a file path, the file is streamed back down in chunks.
If a diff commit is passed in, the difference is computed server side and streamed down.

paths must be relative.
path not found is a 404 error, which is the same as permissions denied.

Permissions is managed by verifying that the requester has the rights to read that file in the first place.

Leave diffing until needed, as full files should be easily manageable by the clients.
