sometimes we need to have a full blown agent to test another bot.
The we would test the adversary bot using conventional spot testing methods, then use it to respond against a complex bot.

This becomes synth testing, where the personas are mocked so they act like a human, possibly drawing on some example data.

The personas can be steered to have different types of fault to exercise all levels of an agents responses.
