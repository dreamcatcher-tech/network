Sometimes files get loaded into agents, including agents themselves being files.

We should be able to try generate large numbers of files that test certain deviations from expected, and ensure that our system can handle these properly.

As well we should be able to talk about the file, and get help from a centrally agreed fact pool ?

If a fact is disputed, it should summarize the contrary viewpoints.
