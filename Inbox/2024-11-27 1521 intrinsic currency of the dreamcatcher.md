Firstly, is it actually needed ?

If it is, then we can get it going by starting a trading pool, like DAI, that pegs and controls the currency.  Using AI running in consensus, it makes decisions about how to set different control parameters.

Means that when people stake currency, they can first stake into a pool to generate native currency, then use this currency efficiently inside the platform, where it saves doing calculations until the very end, and goes up as growth increases.

So there is a large trading pool where people deposit and withdraw.

Makes a system of legal tender where all services will take this currency which simplifies the markets.  Also can be guaranteed, since the external risk is reduced, and the volatility of any other currencies is reduced.

Each transaction is KYC'd so the units are always amalgamated, allowing you to sell your clean currency, or your certified green energy generated currency.  Burning carbon to do the computes that you earned your currency with needs to be recognized.

Means you can spread your risk around, and can transact with kyc guaranteed currencies ?

? we could wrap any currency in kyc'd NFT based units, so like usd that comes from a kyc'd transaction, so you know you are not supporting any foul play.
