From SM.

Instead of making a google doc, program a bot as the knowledge keeper.  It can be chatted with, and questions make it wiser.  It is the authority on a topic, much like how documents in a company are arranged to form an authoritative body of knowledge, like procedures, record keeping.

Nested docbots can be called on to get deep well considered and provable answers.

Some of them specialize in managing collections of files, some in particular knowledge about a topic.

Then can coordinate with each other to push the top level goals forwards.

Periodically run the whole QA sessions into a compaction process, that updates the core sysprompt / knowledge base, so that the answers are of increasingly higher quality.  Test the exact responses against the new sysprompt or model and confirm they match expectation with the modified sysprompt.

Need a way to set up a permanent bot, and then people start new sessions with each one.  Collaborators can see each others sessions, and can even share sessions.

People can set up their own checks on the bot to get flagged when something they consider invariant and fundamental changes.
