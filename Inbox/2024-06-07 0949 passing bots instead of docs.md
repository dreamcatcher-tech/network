From SM.

Instead of making a google doc, program a bot as the knowledge keeper.  It can be chatted with, and questions make it wiser.  It is the authority on a topic, much like how documents in a company are arranged to form an authoritative body of knowledge, like procedures, record keeping.

Nested docbots can be called on to get deep well considered and provable answers.

Some of them specialize in managing collections of files, some in particular knowledge about a topic.

Then can coordinate with each other to push the top level goals forwards.
