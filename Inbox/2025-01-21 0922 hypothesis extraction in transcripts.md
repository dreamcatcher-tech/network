Do a pass that borders on hallucinagenic to come up with things that might be in the transcript.

Then crush it down with an investigative phase.

Then store the extracted topics in a data structure, that includes the data, plus the references to the transcript that prove it / validated it.

These references would refer to timestamped segments of the transcript.  This makes reference easy, as it is just an index or time and speaker reference.

If we miss something, then we can go back in and chat with it more, and it will modify the hypothesis list, as it adds in the bits you want to check.

Even asking questions about a transcript can use this hypothesis method.

Then if evidence is found, which can be in other transcripts as well, then we add that in to the fact pool.

The hypothesis discards can be browsed too.

Flare metrics - the score of how many new things were found each rerun, so that when things have stabilized, we know for sure we have the best possible answer.

Flare the statement or question too, to be similar but worded differently.

This is really about knowing we have the best possible model result, and that rerunning or asking differently wouldn't make a difference.

Can also extract out formats, so when we have a nice pattern to apply, we choose the nicest one.
