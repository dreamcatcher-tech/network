Writing documents that make sense can be very hard, starting from blank can be even harder.  It is easier to say what something shouldn't be rather than what it should be.  Engaging an ML author to stub out what you want to say, and to morph the document as the main points are updated could reduce the human labour component significantly.

If we had a body of law material that we could train on, this would be easier.

So lawmachine should have a goal of producing an open body of court approved documents across different jurisdictions that can be used by anyone to train upon.
