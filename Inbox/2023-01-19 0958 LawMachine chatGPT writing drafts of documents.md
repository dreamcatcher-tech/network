Writing documents that make sense can be very hard, starting from blank can be even harder.  It is easier to say what something shouldn't be rather than what it should be.  Engaging an ML author to stub out what you want to say, and to morph the document as the main points are updated could reduce the human labour component significantly.

If we had a body of law material that we could train on, this would be easier.

So lawmachine should have a goal of producing an open body of court approved documents across different jurisdictions that can be used by anyone to train upon.

Interpret the affidavits, and then find other case law that supports the angle you want.

Write your affidavit, and have it reference other cases.

Provide cheap legal services to the masses using these tools to draft, lawyers simply review and then tweak the prompt input to clean it up.

Try make an overview that suggests fairness to both sides, pre judgement.  Basically try to predict what the judge will say, and show each person.  Use adversarial AI to enumerate your possible angles then pick the best one.

? How can the weapon of time wasting be used with AI tooling ?  Physical hearings, multiple rounds.  If the adversarial law firm is not using AI tooling, then it will cost them a lot.

Seems money to be made in providing law services that specifically use gpt4 inputs to save time while still being legal advice.  Let clients and novices and cheaper elastic workforce people, and even peers in public, help to guide the prompts and the core of the documents and the strategy you are going to follow.  Lawyers providing high quailty assurances for fractions of the price of their full advice and draft.

Furthermore allow reuse and recombination of your prompts and the output of your activities.  Start up packetized funding to purchase services that you need, so it comes as spot pricing.  Find the best experts based on their output, so your defense of attack is actually touched by 20 different lawyers, all the best in their specific area.
