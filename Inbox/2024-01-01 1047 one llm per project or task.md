If the task itself was given the power of an LLM, then it can keep its records in order, and can be chatted with.  The llm is in charge of the project, not any given person, so the decisions made are purely based on what the LLM has said, such as when certain quality thresholds have been crossed.

Then, projects with child tasks can chat with the children to roll up to the head.

So each task is autonomous.
