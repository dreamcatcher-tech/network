Watching the ERP system be able to determine a price for some session prompting was liberating.

Being able to make guesses across many forms of labour, means that even just internally, our guesses should be normalized across the org / network.

So with internal estimation, we would cross check them with each other, and with market data, and with how many takers we are seeing across the network, to know what goods starting prices are.

It should always be known that all staff and all customers can say anything they like to the AI and it will never be disclosed between the parties.  We would also artificially generate the common questions and stances from other similar parties, so you can plausibly deny being hardnosed or cost cutting or other behaviours that are considered rude, since they are the generalized common pattern of all in your position, and the platform defends you as such, rather than you being singled out.

So we manage all the awkward parts of a relationship using the AI as the go between, to smoothen out all the relationships between workers and payers.
