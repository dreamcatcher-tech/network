If we make a set of signing keys that can operate as a distributed app on deno, then we can allow others to run this same template too, so we distribute around the trust.  We are relying on deno, but this is better than making our own docker containers or other things, as the clusters will perform better.

Others can make aws lambda and cloudflare worker backed implementations too.

Plus raw servers can be put online, especially those with GPU attachements.
