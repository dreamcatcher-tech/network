If we register using stripe atlas, that seems easiest.

Then keep the NFTs as belonging to personal entities, or external entities, so the gateway can be collapsed at any time we like.

Ideally multiple gateways would be selectable, with different jurisdictional restrictions.

Some might be a pure smart contract based service.  Feels like we need 3 to show distribution.
