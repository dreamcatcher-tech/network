If we register using stripe atlas, that seems easiest.

Then keep the NFTs as belonging to personal entities, or external entities, so the gateway can be collapsed at any time we like.

Ideally multiple gateways would be selectable, with different jurisdictional restrictions.

Some might be a pure smart contract based service.  Feels like we need 3 to show distribution.

So the gateway matters not, so long as it is trusted, compliant, and behaves well.

We can hold assets and do expenditure thru an external entity.  So long as this is registered somewhere safe, then this is just a user of the gateway, and the gateway itself doesn't matter.

The gateway could be set up by us, and then later sold to the DAO to operate on with some shared governance, and some rules set on chain.  This is done to increase trust in the gateway, but the protocol is the one that holds the record of who did what, and the gateways should run on that platform too.

Test is being able to transform platform credits between gateways - in on one, out on another.
