most friction that anyone suffers is money not being automated, and being able to actually do something wrong with money.  All the tax and all the security should be included in every transaction, so that all people do is whatever they can manage to do.

Each business should be run by an automated agent that ensures they are doing their book-keeping, paying tax, and making sound business decisions.  If they adopt these models, then we can safely deploy capital to boost them.

One of the biggest losses is capital deployments followed by inexperienced errors being made that loses the capital.  The capital then wants more restrictions later, that venturer, who was brave enough to try, will be set back, and so their innovation is lost.

best thingw e could get is endorsement of our business model, so we can be guaranteed that it does not break any investment restrictions.

If they run under this system, then they should get tax breaks, but also capital access.  Also can make a stock exchange that the company value can be traded upon.

Also find a way to reduce the cost of receiving payments into kenya, so we can get paid by foreign companies.
