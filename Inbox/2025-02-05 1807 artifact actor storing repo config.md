Storing as a single json makes interpreting hard - might be best stored as individual files on the disk ?  Then when the list gets large, there is no problem.

Also the name is the filename ?

So we just make a folder named 'repos' and store the items in there ?

But then is it atomic like what is used for refs ?

Is it just another repo, but it has a special pointer ?

There should be rules for what is allowed as a set of changes to a commit ?

Or, can do anything, so long as format is ok, and that means events are deduced.
