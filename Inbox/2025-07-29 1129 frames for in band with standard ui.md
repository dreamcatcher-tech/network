it should be able to ask for ui that is provided as standard by the client.
server can be made aware of what the client ui elements are available.
it then selects the ones that can decorate its usage best.

could be a map picker to get a specific location.

could be a data picker, or a range picker.

these would load up in band, allowing the human to select nicely.

thse could start with just web standard things, like form inputs, but the client could expose some more exotic ones.
