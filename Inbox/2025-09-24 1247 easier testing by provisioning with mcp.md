if the actual provisioning steps were in fact mcp calls, then it might be easier to test the system, if we added those tools to the bot, possibly the bot running on our local machine, and used this to exercise the system ?

ultimately we want to have the provisioning be done by mcp anyway, so making it do these things might be easier ?
