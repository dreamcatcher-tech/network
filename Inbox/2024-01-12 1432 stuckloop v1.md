This should be writeable so any other means can be coded into the system.
It is basically how to process an incoming action.

chat streams are just piping the user input into the system to trigger actions.
you can use our tools to edit what this is.
changing the default can lock out editing, so can be used for kiosk mode or other things.

process:
chat prompt comes in from the user
some clarifying questions might get asked
stuck-finder uses this to figure out the best goal
initially we just load up all the helps and ask gpt4 to pick the best one
once we have settled on one, we set about executing it.
some prep work may be needed if we don't have all the functions or prerequisites
ultimately, we have a range of functions 



"run the tests on the stuckloop"
should trigger the function call to start up the test runner, which will load up custom isolates that a copied from running isolates, and walk thru thru the examples in a new thread
When something changes in the original that its tracking, AI tooling can attempt reconciliation
check if anything changed since last run, and if not, warn
to view the results they can be presented in the stateboard, or we can drop in at a specific commit and show it in the chat window, so you can fork and carry on from a given location.
