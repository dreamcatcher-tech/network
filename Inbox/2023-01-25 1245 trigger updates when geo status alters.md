## Options
1. Customers collection update sends
2. routing/sector/order only includes those items that have been approved by a human
3. 3rd structure, that is the LUT for quick lookups both ways
4. Routing status that shows if routing is currently up to date with the customers collection
5. Sector membership is a derived property in each customer

## Unpublished manifests
When the manifest is not yet locked to a specific instance of the customers and routing collections, then it needs to be calculated on the fly.  If this was a transient, then this is easy to remount it whne changes are detected.
