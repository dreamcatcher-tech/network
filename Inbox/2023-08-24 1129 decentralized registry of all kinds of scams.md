If we model the business of any entity, corporate, network based, psychometric, then we should be able to draw conclusions and issue rankings on these activities.

If we stick to only crypto based projects, then we are starved, and people have to think that there can be scam free crypto projects in the first place.  In reality there are more scams that are not crypto related.

Like a whitelist of all human activities.

How could we model an actor spreading discord amongst the crew ?
