They don't need to actually blank the io files, or the session files, as they can be pure patches ?

So the session chat, if sending patches down, would just walk the logs, and flicker between the two files.
These could be assembled in parallel, for speed.

If the file is designed correctly, then it still carries meaning if you don't have a base.

The io system should be using these diffs anyway, under the hood, using json patch, rather than the hand crusted version we made.

Means that trimming the io files can be done any time in the future, we just work with patches all the way thru.

Display of multiple splices can be represented as a single splice, so we can perform reducing operations on them quickly.

Viewing the block explorer should be just using the same git repo interogation tools as any other system.  Watching for commits is the same as watching for a change in a file.

Watching for commits is watching the `/` path.

Visualizer should be able to take any path, and some commit like query, and a pid.
It should then start to stream down jsonpatches of splices.
If a commit range was given, then the splices come down one for each commit, using a patch based on differences, with the first one having the full file.

Tracking a file would only give splices when a commit occured that changed it.
Once we get to the tip, we start receiving a different type of splice, which is 

Splices only deal with text based files.
Can be in object format, which is processed server side.

We can switch between json and text diffing tooling, since json cannot do text.
A text file could be split by whitespace and diffed like that ?

Key is that subscriptions are active - the api will behave differently if there are watchers for the changes.

This visualization is edgeside - not queueside.

Then move pierce watching to use this commit watching piece.

May stream down pieces of large files using diffs, to give a smooth render experience for large files.

Arbitrary spans for splices - being able to ask for a range of commits and getting back a single patch.  With no start given, the patch just gets the latest commit, if any.
But wbout if we want one patch for each commit ? 
Or a single patch that gets us from one given commit that we have, to another commit we don't have ?

The commiter should update all the splice watchers, since it already has the files loaded.
If there are too many watchers, it can send the task off in a queue ?
Watchers should have to fish out the repo and see what they wanted.
They should walk the trees with caution, so they bail when they know there was no change to their file.

? Spanning branches ? spanning commits ?

? Tree of files if we want to get the whole file structure, or just what changed in it ?

## Splice watching for an action with lifecycles
Start by watching the io file.
Watch the pool too, so when something is pooled.
Seems more work than needed, since pooling is so brief.
? should splices be able to target a path within the json object to watch, or should this be post processing ?

## chat session with forks
single thread we would just subscribe to the session pid, and the session file path.

## Grabbing all the history of the channel
Each patch would come with with reference to a patch that came before it.
patch would appear as string diffs for a json object to be applied.
So client holds a string, and keeps patching it, then parsing it each time.
Store the inflated version along with the patch, so we can walk the inflated version client side.

To view the channel at a particular commit, we would walk up and down this cache

When receive patches that are past the head, these are transient, and we will always receive a full commit patch upon commit.  Transients are using broadcast channels so they might miss some data, or have some errors.
Server side the received patch is checked for errors and if it errors, we assume the bchannel was faulty, so we could ask for a retransmit or something ?
Ask directly for a catchup on the transient patches, so you get a catch up from the last commit before the next transient goes out.
