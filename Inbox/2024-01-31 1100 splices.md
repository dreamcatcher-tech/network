They don't need to actually blank the io files, or the session files, as they can be pure patches ?

So the session chat, if sending patches down, would just walk the logs, and flicker between the two files.
These could be assembled in parallel, for speed.

If the file is designed correctly, then it still carries meaning if you don't have a base.

The io system should be using these diffs anyway, under the hood, using json patch, rather than the hand crusted version we made.
