They don't need to actually blank the io files, or the session files, as they can be pure patches ?

So the session chat, if sending patches down, would just walk the logs, and flicker between the two files.
These could be assembled in parallel, for speed.

If the file is designed correctly, then it still carries meaning if you don't have a base.

The io system should be using these diffs anyway, under the hood, using json patch, rather than the hand crusted version we made.

Means that trimming the io files can be done any time in the future, we just work with patches all the way thru.

Display of multiple splices can be represented as a single splice, so we can perform reducing operations on them quickly.

Viewing the block explorer should be just using the same git repo interogation tools as any other system.  Watching for commits is the same as watching for a change in a file.

Watching for commits is watching the `/` path.
