They don't need to actually blank the io files, or the session files, as they can be pure patches ?

So the session chat, if sending patches down, would just walk the logs, and flicker between the two files.
These could be assembled in parallel, for speed.

If the file is designed correctly, then it still carries meaning if you don't have a base.

The io system should be using these diffs anyway, under the hood, using json patch, rather than the hand crusted version we made.

Means that trimming the io files can be done any time in the future, we just work with patches all the way thru.

Display of multiple splices can be represented as a single splice, so we can perform reducing operations on them quickly.

Viewing the block explorer should be just using the same git repo interogation tools as any other system.  Watching for commits is the same as watching for a change in a file.

Watching for commits is watching the `/` path.

Visualizer should be able to take any path, and some commit like query, and a pid.
It should then start to stream down jsonpatches of splices.
If a commit range was given, then the splices come down one for each commit, using a patch based on differences, with the first one having the full file.

Tracking a file would only give splices when a commit occured that changed it.
Once we get to the tip, we start receiving a different type of splice, which is transient.

Splices only deal with text based files.
json requires client side interpretation.

Key is that subscriptions are active - the api will behave differently if there are watchers for the changes.

Broadcast channels for changes.
Make a single channel for the changes to a particular file or path ?
Channel that broadcasts all changes for a given PID, as patches.
If there is no commit watchers registered, then there is no need for transience ?
Watch for the addition of any new watchers and if some appear, start the diffing process on transient stuff ?
Or just broadcast transient splices anyway, and do some tuning later.

Commit patches are

Pool patches ?
When tracing a given action, could get some lifecycle updates on it ?
received by edge, entered the pool, in a commit, replied to.
? How can we trace actions across many different pids ?
Server side trace the io file, then interpret it ?
Client would be streamed down splices that follow the flow of execution, to avoid the client having to rerequest these things themselves.

This subsystem should include diffing between version and between chains very easily.
The patch can be interpreted differently to show what changed between two versions.
## chat session with forks
single thread we would just subscribe to the session pid, and the session file path.

## Grabbing all the history of the channel
Each patch would come with with reference to a patch that came before it.
patch would appear as string diffs for a json object to be applied.
So client holds a string, and keeps patching it, then parsing it each time.
Store the inflated version along with the patch, so we can walk the inflated version client side.

To view the channel at a particular commit, we would walk up and down this cache

When receive patches that are past the head, these are transient, and we will always receive a full commit patch upon commit.  Transients are using broadcast channels so they might miss some data, or have some errors.
Commit patches are based on the kv store, so they are reliable.
Server side the received patch is checked for errors and if it errors, we assume the bchannel was faulty, so we
