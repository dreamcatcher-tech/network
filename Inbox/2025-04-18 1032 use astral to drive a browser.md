Seems a nice clean library, that can be used for connection to operator, or for scraping some pages, or possibly even actual browsing maybe.

Present an interface that looks like an agent, so it is just a screenshot, but when you click somewhere, it gets sent back to the backend.  It gets recorded like any other interaction, which gives us something to learn from.  Also keeps the backend cheap, since just showing snapshots.

We could offer a translated experience, where you get presented a mutated, sanitized, quiet, view of the page information, rather than the page itself.  Then when you interact, we send that back.  It is like an AI adblocker.

So in this case, we are rendering a page that represents our translated view, made with some standard building blocks that we have created.

using xpra could be used to show whole desktop apps for old apps ?
