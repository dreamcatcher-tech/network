Client knows its changes have been applied when the mw branch has its changes.
Client knows its changes were rejected when the changes branch 


Client knows its changes have been received by the artifact server when they have landed on the changes branch.  
Client knows its changes were accepted by the moneyworks server when the changes branch does a merge with the mw branch, and its changes are still there.


If we pull from moneyworks and it overwrites the client changes ?


Is there a cheaper version, since this is only in place until the moneyworks server gets replaced ?
