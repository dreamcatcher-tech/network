Ignition process - using env vars to know if we should generate a chain or not
Native relaying
Test delays in pierce watching - move to head being more informational
Find why slow in cloud - watching, splice generation, etc
Load tests
Full cloud tests
Basic profiling
Verify the cache is in use when reading commits
Braodcast the io.jsom oid when it changed, to allow instant lookups

Put a delay on db writes, so we can time requests and see the effect of caching speeding things up.
Benchamrk with db, where db should be configured with a delay, and the benchmarks should increase linearly, not get amplified by the delay

Make all db writes return instantly, but flush all before returning from the commit action.
