show threads of help invocations in UI
navigating git in the UI
be able to update HAL and push back to the core repo
small customer test
larger than atomics can handle features - be able to spawn 1000 branches gracefully
large customer test
mertrics on cloud, including error rates, so can tune effectively
certain errors in atomics should be atomic errors and not cause a message retry
atomics should be resumable very cheaply
store pierce outputs directly, so that splice watching can be skipped over
reliable high volume transaction processing, but start with reliable low volume for SM
Native relaying
Benchmarks
Do not clone HAL each session, do this only once on account creation
Change account management in the UI to use dedicated account chains

Full user account testing
oauth
billing
Large file loading
Parallel intelligence tests

Modifying lots of files in parallel, like separate customer records.
Dashboard with total processing for the platform, and the protocol in general, like tokens consumed, ai credits spent, db writes and reads, data under management.

inside a deploy instance, is each run isolated fromt he other ?
how much impact does the ajv schema step have for us ?

isolate reuse counter by storing a global and incrementing it each time.

How can we get back to helps and generating NL apps ?

Fine tuning on synthetic data once we have big prompts that we like and want to bake the model down for speed - can bake multistep operations to increase speed.
Vector db usage so we can use embeddings liberally, to make recall across large datasets.
