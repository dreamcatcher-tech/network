Drone defenses seem hard.
Phalanx, if made cheaply, could be a good ground based defense ?

Or have a net of other drones in the sky.
If a mesh of drones were each armed with a single shot smart explosive, then having them all airborne could cover a larger area than a phalanx.
Drone aims by orienting itself.
When it fires, the only control it has is timing of when to detonate.  This is programmed into the shot before it launches.  Acts like a flak cannon.
Could have several shots, with no reload mechanism, since each round is electronically fired and packed in, like metalstorm.
Same principle as a flak cannot, but in a swarm of drones.

If the drones could be rapidly launched into location, like they rode the tip of a reusable rocket to get in position ?
Rocket fires, with 20 drones, they get ejected in good positions, and they hover.

A low cost drone with high explosive should be able to be close enough to the flight path of a high speed incoming weapon that it can detonate.

Lasers seem the best option.

The mesh would also provide scanning.

Key is to always reuse the drones, as this is a cost saving exercise.
