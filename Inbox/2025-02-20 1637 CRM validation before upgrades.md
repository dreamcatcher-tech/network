If the benchmark is the future runs, and making some edits to some customers and observing the result, then we should be able to validate new versions of the core, or the UI ?

We should run the new version and the old version, driven by an agent that attempts to drive the system to do the basic things, so drive the system using only the user interface.  If we output the same run manifests, for 100 days in the future, then the system is acceptable as an upgrade.

The system should be agent native, where agents are just in built things, and humans just look like another agent.
