whenever people use Artifact as devs they would have to declare their Napp interfaces. When they start working with these things, we need to be able to generate type-safe clients for them so that they can call these functions without issues. I wonder if we should adopt some frameworks like tRPC or others to make this job a lot more seamless. We could also use the same framework in our own development of our backend.
