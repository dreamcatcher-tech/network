If you want to make your own ai code editor, then you have to do a lot of the same things as anyone else trying to do the same thing.

We provide the framework by which you can experiment and work on to build your own editor, work on github repos, and launch to paying customers.

You can bring your own customers, or you can use the networks.

We would offer the patchy dev environment, where the whole environment was configurable as napps, and we offer several versions of this for people to choose from, being reconfigured using a chat interface.
