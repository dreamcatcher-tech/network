If each validator actually uses the randomness to make a different response, and then they all pick the one they like the best as the response, this is a better use of voting rather than all generating the same thing.

So they all propose, and then they all choose the one they liked the most.

So in a group of 10, you might get 8 variations, and then they all choose between them for a ranking, so the quality of the output is higher than just a single one, rather than consensus being a burden.
