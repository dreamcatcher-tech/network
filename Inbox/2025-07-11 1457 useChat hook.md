we want to use this only for the latest message, so we can have the streaming thing going on.

This might be too time consuming to set up at the start ?

We could just interpret the full stream ourselves, and manage our own hooks.

It seems that all the useChat hook gives is messages, and the full and partial state of the messages.

so it hides what we can probably interpret ourselves anyway, if we just interpret the stream correctly, and use their same lifecycle hooks.

So we need to make our own set of hooks for the chats napp.
Gives an easy standard way to list the chats that are in the system, list the messages, follow streaming of messages, submit new messages.

Build it inside the main app, then port it over to the napp itself.

but, cannot have any deps on a jsr package, so we need to somehow make it standalone, or use deno as the build manager.

Is the current useChat method going to be replaced when we have a universal streaming interface, so that any ui can catch up on, or otherwise watch, streaming events ?

we can set the message id as temporary perhaps ?
then clobber when the generation is done ?
