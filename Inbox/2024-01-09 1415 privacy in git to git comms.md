Consequences without exposing information may be needed.  Hostile repos sharing data without exposing the whole repo.
If a remote is not allowed to see the consequences information, then we can simply hide that file, which is why it should be in a separate file.

Insert a single piece of randomness in the root and use that to fuzz each channel.
Pass proofs along where they contain the state of the registers up to the point of hashing the next channel, so it acts like a continuation - you supply the data on either side of the piece you want to prove.  We should park the privacy part until later, just know that we can do it.  Could that be an LLM task ?
