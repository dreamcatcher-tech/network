Being able to generate task definitions and time / effort / cost forecasts might be the most important thing we can do.

We would immediately use this for our own tasks.  Ties in to requirements management.

Linking in to meetings would mean we can reduce the effort required to upkeep requirements and task definitions down to having a discussion about it, which seems trivially easy in comparison.

Being able to map out our roadmap, and steps to go, with a calculation about time taken.

Swing on this as the thing to build - what will he do with all these ideas, all this invention that will never be realized ?  Every inventors desire for recognition from their ideas - what would a safe place need to honour ?

Launching the crowdfunding is dependent on being able to express our tasks in a meaningful way, like agile tasks.  This is the trigger point of the company formation.

If we took all the supplied example companies, and then included the structures that made them, like the corporate structures and investments, then this is what the Dreamcatcher would be.

This looking inside a company and analyzing it, is a fabulous use case for our system, and I would like to do this experiment as soon as we have the capability.

Making a base system to autonomously do many of the common tasks of a company, like keeping release notes updated, website updated, roadmap.  It should all be automatically derived.  So maybe LP would benefit most from him trying to use it to accomplish something, and we build up tooling to make it possible.
