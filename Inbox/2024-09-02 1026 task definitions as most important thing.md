Being able to generate task definitions and time / effort / cost forecasts might be the most important thing we can do.

We would immediately use this for our own tasks.  Ties in to requirements management.

Linking in to meetings would mean we can reduce the effort required to upkeep requirements and task definitions down to having a discussion about it, which seems trivially easy in comparison.

Being able to map out our roadmap, and steps to go, with a calculation about time taken.
