Take a photo of the project plans, and ask GPT4 to generate anonymized versions of them, with all details randomly changed to realistic values.

Then we can demonstrate the system working with synthetic inputs of all kinds, and outputing meaningful and traceable results.  So then updates to project plans can come in via any format, and the plans can be updated to match. 

Also propose alterations to the project plans that would set the dashboard metrics higher and allow a better solution of the problem was changed slightly.

We can prior test the system to take in project descriptions of all kinds, and different scheduling requirements, and generate an output in some useful way.  We should run this thru a piece of code that checks the sanity of the proposed output, so that it can be looped until it is guaranteed to be correct.  It doesn't need to have the best possible answer, it just needs to be better than a human and with less time.
