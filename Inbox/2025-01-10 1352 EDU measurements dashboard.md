episodic memory based on medium.  Remembering what tv was watched yesterday, vs what chatgpt said yesterday, vs anchored recollection, such as information near a memory.

measure the semantic memory preferences - typically girls would remember different things to boys, whereas boys would recall vehicles.

Teach them tools to expand these memories, like anchoring tools.

They think they're getting a storytime / fun friend, but they're actually getting schooled, neatly.  Also measured, and their performance in national standards correlated.

If we capture all the interactions, a new measurement can be added, or existing modified, and it can be presented based on the data.

The steering can be in modules, based on what the parent wants.
