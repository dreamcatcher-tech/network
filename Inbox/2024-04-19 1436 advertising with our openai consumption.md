If homepage graphs, or a jitter that could show the graphs of token usage were shown, then this gives a sense of scale, as to what we can do.

These jitters are available in any app, and can be configured in data pipelines where the ai will arrange different transformation components in plain text, and the output of the pipeline is highly processed data in graphs that are unique to your chat session.

Rules for how to combine components together need to be tightly defined.

As quick as we can, we need some usage data, to do some fine tuning with, so that we fit user requirements as quick as possible.

Can be like powerbi, but chat based, where you can tinker around with charts easily.
