The keys to the containers have to persist.

we should run that centrally.  it can manage the load balancing of the network, and make autonomous decisions about where to run things.

each container should commit its state to a blockchain, so that you can verify that the machine ran correctly at every point along the way.

other way is to run the keys on each computer.

sealed keys can be used to persist keys, in a way that survives a reboot.
this might allow an even more energy efficient hibernation step.

sealed keys increase chance of tamper, but do allow us to survive power cycle.

without sealed keys, we have to always have a machine online.

a hibernated computer could be powered on by the host chain if either a password was correct or there was a request that came in.  this wakes the machine, loads up the keys, 

The load balancer should be the same as the marketplace, and it should be a completely autonomous system.
