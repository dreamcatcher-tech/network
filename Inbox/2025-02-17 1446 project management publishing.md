Without a breakdown of remaining tasks, it is hard to forecast how much longer things will take.

So we need to start publishing project data, so we can know how the burndown is going.

Then effects like 'we got to the end and we have to bin it all' can explain the unknown parts.

Having meetings about these, and explaining each piece, can help the definitions significantly.

So if we could just get that top level schedule up, that woudl ease a lot of pain, really.

If the shared calendar could be updated just by voice, and could run different whatif scenarios, and was scoring things on a dashboard ?

Given the progress we have recorded so far, we should be able to get the machines to guess at how long other work might take, like how long to do the execution portion of the chain.

Make a dashboard that shows the size of the components we need to achive full dreamcatcher, then rings out, showing the extra work to achieve different readiness levels.
