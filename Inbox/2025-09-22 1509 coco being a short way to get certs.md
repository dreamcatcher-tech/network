HIPAA and other certs could be provided by us, so that your app gets ai guidance how to pass these certs, we have ai auditors running continually, and we have a design that is self sovereign by default / confidential by default.

our infra doesn't actually run without confidentiality, actually.

getting these certs is a huge burden, and we could get that for you by default, if we were your trusetd hoster.
