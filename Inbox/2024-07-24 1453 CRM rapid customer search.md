drop an index file down that is full of autocompletes so as they're typing, it tries to auto complete with an address or something ?

Stateboard showing a search widget, and the last customers to be updated.

Typing in the search ra

Maintain a single file / sharded file of all the records compressed together and indexed to a customerID.

We could sync down every file ?

Rendering actual widgets in band, which can access the backchat api ?

If a component renders, then it can access artifact resources for as long as it is mounted.

Reconciling manifests is the same problem too.

Probably tied in to the index service of the whole repo.
Should pull down index files.
Could also make rapid ai calls to produce ranked results as you type.
