Make a service where api calls to do different things are charged for, eg: export to markdown, stories, etc.

Then the GUI becomes simply a way to make api calls.

CI tooling can use the same calls and gets billed accordingly.

If save calls cost money too, and saving is forever, then there is no need for monthly subscriptions, but your data is always there.
