If plex was made serverless, then sharing media could be scalable, and so you could share on a per media file model.  So with the share comes the resources to play it, stream it, transcode it.

In the serverless world, this means that plex has zero idle cost.  Also transcoding of the same files across multiple accounts results in the same torrent chunks being shared.  So its basically a torrent transcoding service.

People pay to access the chunks.

Should be able to do adversarial modelling to ensure enough safeguards are in place, should the content be leaked.

can torrents be made serverless too ?
