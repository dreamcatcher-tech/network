Any time a problem occurs and either we detect it or the human wants it noted, then instead of this being a problem that the user just ragequits about, we propose it as a business opportunity.  They can fix it themselves, spec the problem out, provide funding, find others who can fix it - all these carry a proportional reward.

Help them find others with the same problem, and let them meaningfully contribute, even if its in discussion or asking questions that help clarify, or usage data showing where they got stuck.

This is the core proposition of the Dreamcatcher, at its most granular level.  The proposition is the same even as the scale increases.  VCs are really trying to fix a large problem, but the model is the same.
