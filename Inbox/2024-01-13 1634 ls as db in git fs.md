if we make ls be a highly optimized command, then we can use it like a database.
Also find can be tuned to be like a db.

So the find tool gets rewritten to do graphql queries.

Also can optimize it for plain text, or for calling an AI on every record, even if its a small AI.

searching should be AI assisted anyway, and can have vector search suggestions stream in too.
