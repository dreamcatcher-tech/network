Allow people to have a range of different AI things
Let people specify a given task that they want done, in a way that it can be run against multiple other models.

Let people then play with all these other tools, but also have them recommended to them, as we would have an AI powered search system that they could converse with.

Bring in large numbers of files and then parse the AI calls over the top of them rapidly.
