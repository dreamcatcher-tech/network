We would ingest prompts, do evals, auto detect faults, let people configure flows, run in parallel.

Just being able to run in parallel is useful.

Have records in git, that are repeatable, allow large files, allow migration of the runtime.
So how we actually execute should be irrelevant.
Hooking with the stuckloop with optional permissions is important, plus a swarm of people who can improve the faulted parts.

Let people experiment with their topography and other solutions - make a very rapid prototyping suite, and a way to eval them.
