For when a given change will occur, we should have forecasts that are made up of discrete pieces of reasoning.

Can also take best worst expected type calculations.

Basically if we break something down, and if we have other assumptions in our world view, then we should get accurate results that do not contradict.

This makes it important to pull in assumptions from other sources, like prediction markets.

We should be able to bet on these things with nothing more than our reputation.

Then whenever someone asks "when" you can provide an answer as well as a breakdown of reasoning.  You can then choose to gamble or stake against this for the purpose of building a higher model upon it.

Staking on an outcome is different to just betting, you're affirming it for the purpose of building a future model.

If your stacked model works out mostly true you get paid a lot.  Should show if you're leveraging your convictions maximally tho.

Calculate the risk and rewards from different actions based on assumptions.  Highlight assumptions you're making implicitly, and insert these in prediction markets for people to gamble upon.
