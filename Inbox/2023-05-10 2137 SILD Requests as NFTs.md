Mint an NFT that has some artwork, a gps location, a time limit during which it cannot be transferred.  These NFTs can be set up in the collection and people can endeavour to earn them using a QA style process.

They are the start of the attribution tree.  People can purchase partials of the token as a means of fundraising, which just mints them an NFT with the trait of the amount they paid for it.  When QA approves the token award, then the recipient(s) receive the money as well as the NFT.  Paying in mints a contributor flavour of the NFT, and then submitting work can mind a contributor. 

Geolocate an NFT so it has a fixed location

Example:
SI needs a starlink dish, but they are hard to come by on the island.  
Starting with zero dollars, mint an NFT as the reward for fulfilling the request.  This should come from the Satoshi Island Contributors minter, and should allow minting to multiple addresses.

Long run, we want the pooling option, so that a pool can be set up to purchase capital equipment, then it gets put to work 

National exports from the island.

Making a host that can run any chains seems the best thing to do first.  We can run the actual Dreamcatcher, start coordinating people, and make it easy to deploy test apps.  Then we can run apps in trusted mode.
