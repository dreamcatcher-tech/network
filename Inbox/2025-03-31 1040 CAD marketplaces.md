If we gave the software away for free, and also sold AI tokens to run advanced features, plus some storage, then we could make money on the marketplace we could facilitate.

People who want CAD drawings or modifications done, on an ever expanding free library.

Sell tokens on FEA to assure components.

People want parts manufactured, based on price, quality, material properties, locality, lead time.

So if we make the software free, but we charge a skim on services you purchase, then this can pay for making the software much better.  Make the AI favour using parts that meet the demands you want.

Add financial services, like prepaid invoices, insurance for quality, dispute resolution, help purchasing new machinery in favourable locations.

Indirect money streams are the best way to take on an encumbent, since you can give your software away for free.
