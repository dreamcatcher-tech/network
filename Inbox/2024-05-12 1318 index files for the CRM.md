If we made compressed index files, like of all the names and customer numbers, then we could do rapid lookups using AI but without passing in the whole data set.

So we would keep the list of customers updated with names, as well as pickup schedules.
These would be forced to be updated whenever a change to a customer occurred.

So instead of passing each record thru an AI, we would pass the index file in, in chunks.
We would occasionally generate new index files whenever we spot a kind of query that would benefit from it.
