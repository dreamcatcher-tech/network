Each time the workbench is guided to do something different, we can emulate what the human did, so we can do it automatically next time.

We can be building up background instructions and tunings to replicate this.

We can also see if what the human is doing is likely fruitful, and advise them as such.

So whenever someone does something that gets a better outcome, we record and process that, so it is immediately available as an updated tool strategy that we will attempt when something looks similar.

For each individual, we can prefer it, if they do it often, since we are there to serve them.

like for example, in cursor, whenever it goes to do an import, I get a linter error because it doesn't end in '.ts' and so I immediately go and type that in there.  It should be watching these things I do, and learn that I always need that.  Then if others are similar, we can make it part of the defaults.  Or leave it as part of my local preferences.
