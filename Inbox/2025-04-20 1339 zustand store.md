```ts
const dir:Meta[] | undefined = useDir('some/path')
```

should be able to watch something using the hook, rather than having to call a function directly ?
This should start up a watcher ?  and auto tear it down when the hook unmounts ?


currently we can just use watch and unwatch in an effect.

purpose of useStore is so it can trigger rerenders on change.
