```ts
const dir:Meta[] | undefined = useDir('some/path')
```

should be able to watch something using the hook, rather than having to call a function directly ?
This should start up a watcher ?  and auto tear it down when the hook unmounts ?


currently we can just use watch and unwatch in an effect.

purpose of useStore is so it can trigger rerenders on change.

persist the store to save it from loading every time - when we rehydrate, mark everthing as stale.

share it between tabs with https://github.com/react18-tools/zustand-sync-tabs

but they say that the store IS a hook already, natively ?

ls on a full path - all of them should be stored in a map, so we never ask the same thing more than once.

sharded watches need to avoid collisions

make a store of the last five minutes ago, so we can highlight whats new.
store the config of the watcher as state, and then trigger in response to it ?

There's an issue that during the synchronizing the old tree is being wiped out and we're not taking advantage of the fact that the OIDs may be the same and we can skip the sync.
