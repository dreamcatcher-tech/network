Run some eval loops, where the output of something is put in, and then the result is evaluated, so that the prompt runner can try make changes to the prompt.

We can probably have prompts and other things for o1-pro even without and api, so inside a napp, we can have a thing that will select or generate prompts for o1-pro ?

Then just do the manual step of selecting it, possibly as a CLI tool, so you can choose what type of prompt you want, or do some kind of prompt building, where you select from items.
