triggerfy

test email addresses using a call that checks for a valid email.

read what a person has been saying on linked in, so we can get a guage of their personality, know how to hook them on relevant recent events.

watch influencers for trends and signals, trigger when something noteworthy occurs.  

model webs of people.

learn from the conversation so we know other relevant things to be talking to this person about.

its basically about perfectly crafted information insertion to hook these people, possibly using several levels deep.

should be some incentive to open up your contact books to us, and we'll always show you what we're doing.  plus you could actually actively try to hook up people on your list, personally, for an affiliate cut.  also get paid for doing intros.**
