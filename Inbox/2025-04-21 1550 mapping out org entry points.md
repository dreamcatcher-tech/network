We should be able to have a discussion with someone, find out everything they know about a particular organization (like some sort of a military establishment). Based on names they drop, we can plot the relationship between that person, these people, and their other relationships. We can then troll the internet and whatever other data sources we have access to so that we can build up a history of this person, as well as a current snapshot and forecast a trajectory. We can then figure out who are people that can contact this person, what things they are interested in, and what things the person of interest is interested in. This is how we can begin to sway an organization or enter an organization with the minimum amount of effort. Each interaction with this org or the rest of the world would update our view and our forecast best entry point.

Using these tools, communications like emails and texts can be generated to be more appealing, can be selected for delivery personnel, so some people would prefer to hear from a young female, others would prefer to hear from an old male. The timing of the messages can also be selected in our favor. All of this requires very little time from the people who are pushing the organizational entry. 

This can be used to source deals where people are looking for mineral procurements of certain amounts and they're looking for people who can connect them up with the right type of mineral resources. These tools can help us find the people we want, find a good way to meet with them, coordinate schedules across the world for time zones and locations and suitability as well as build composite deals where several deals are rolled up into one or broken apart so that they are more manageable.
