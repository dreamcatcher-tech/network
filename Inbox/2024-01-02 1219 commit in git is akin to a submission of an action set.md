Somehow the use of a commit in git should be used to allow clients to make multiple changes and they attempt to merge the PR back into the master branch.  Conflict resolution needs to be handled client side somehow so that master doesn't have to make any decisions.

Should be able to hold a place in the merge queue to avoid getting locked out of heavily changing systems since you can never seem to get your changes in there.

Staging is where we are executing actions and running down all the consequences, then when we are happy, a commit is formed that indicates all the changes we made.

Commit might indicate all the initial actions or conditions that we made upon the system ?
