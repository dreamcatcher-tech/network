Means we can do things concurrently, and the requests will wait for the branch to be created rather than rejecting.

Could also just allow pooling if the branch doesn't exist as a simple way to do this ?

Allow a param that lets them pool before the branch exists, and ensure that branch creation pulls them in ?
