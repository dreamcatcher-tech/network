in storage we have the artifact repo structure which is a tessellating unit of consensus computation which can be hosted on the standard environment. 

Then we have napps or natural applications which are a way to execute across any language any application using a JSON function invocation integrated with the artifact repo 

standard environment provides a way to store the artifact repos in a permissioned way and a decentralized way and to control them using JSON function calls while executing napps.
