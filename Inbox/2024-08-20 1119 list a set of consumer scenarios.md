Just like we have tests for bots, we should have a list of scenarios for usage of our system, and ways to sell to end customers.

Any new revenue lines need to be tested in this way.

then based on our current plans, the bots would answer.

We should be able to make a map of all the opportunities we have found, and then link them to the types of thing we can pursue.  We want to form a network of people all committed to ambient attribution, and all able to swarm on these opportunities as we learn about them and uncover more.
