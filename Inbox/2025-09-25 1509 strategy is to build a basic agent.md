get the whole system working end to end with just a simple basic agent that just presents a basic debugging web server, and then use this to test all the machinery with.

Then build up more advanced agents, and deploy those as a separate effort, so we can launch with a working structure first, and then work up to more advanced agents, without them complicating things.

Then we push out to make nfs be blockchain backed.

so we have the basic router, which provisions just by creating nfs folders.

then we have the executor, which just ensures you have an actual machine waiting for you.
