Make a system that can submit a packet to multiple DAOs in order to obtain funding from them for it.  Checkbox a large number and have the gas show up.

Proposal Inverter is an existing system that aims to do such a thing with conventional DAOs, but what it lacks is a standard platform for the proposal itself to exist independently, rather than existing inside a DAO.

Then the packet shoudl show which DAOs are doing what to it, in this unified view.
