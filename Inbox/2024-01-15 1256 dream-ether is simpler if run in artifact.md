So artifact would have control of the NFTs, and all interaction with the system is handled by artifact.
Artifact would bridge to eth, and control the update of the NFT states.
The nfts could be traded on eth maybe ?

Might actually require the trading to occur inside the eth chain.

Best if just the funds come to us, and then we handle all the trading.  The loss is the removal of opensea access.  The gain is users on our broader platform.  We trade better, so we'd look like an internal exchange at that point.

Might be slower, but is more aligned with us becoming a chain.
