If each compute has just whatever ssd it has available, and knows its own reliability, then it can coordinate with others to shuffle object bits around.

whatever the recovery mode for corrupted data is, this should be the same as for load balancing or as for any retrieval - uses gossip like things to track the objects down, and always keeps them hot.  Packs git repos so it always has the latest lump.  Uses affinity for processing repos so stay close to the user.
