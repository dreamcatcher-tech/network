If clicking on a message could affect the stateboard.
Stateboard stack can be vertical or can be browsed back and forwards ?

If you editing somethign on the stateboard and then clicked a message, what would happen to your edited work ?

Hold the changes against the stateboard display message, that you can click back on.
If you escape from all stateboards, then you get 

Clicking on an agent in a message should pull it up in the stateboard and allow you to edit that agent immediately, in a sandbox.  Edit in sandbox button triggers a new branch and then focuses the stateboard on that item, allowing direct edit.

Attaching a web link would show the page loading in an iframe, and then would take a picture of the iframe. 
Attaching a text selection would pop up the stateboard.
The stateboard control message is what would show in the message thread, and it would show that you had not submitted it to the core yet.

Ai initiated stateboard changes show in the message thread, and can be clicked on.

Agent viewer would show the full blown agent, both as raw markdown, but also as fully processed api calls.  Possibly allow an api call to be done, so you can play with it.

File upload tool could show the upload in the stateboard ?  Or just upload as a loose object, then attach it in ?

Stateboard have a little button where the prompt would go so that it can be toggled in or out.
That widget goes to the right side of the prompt when retracted.  Is there even in full size version.  This can be a FAB which just moves with the stateboard.

Repobrowser - can just be a quick search widget.
Open a repo then shows the file browser widget, with the branch explorer stacked on top ?

What to do when a file in the filebrowser is clicked ?
Attach some file openers to it, like the agent browser and editor ?

Stateboard isolate tool has some options, like scope? Also starting directory ?

read the file by using oids and fetching git objects directly.

? Should the file explorer attachment be a way to call up the stateboard with a file exporer ?

A repo widget would handle things like pull and push, but could also be controlled by the AI at the same time, since it would interact with an isolate of the same / similar name ?
