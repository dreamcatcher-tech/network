Can start with tree as a separate folder in the meta root, but then might be able to move it into permissions.

How to get the host repo ?
Without using the blob store directly.

It should be a function that is otherwise denied, since it can have a false envelope, which would otherwise be denied, meaning it originated internally.

If I drop in an action with instructions for the repo, into the container directly, then I must have authority.

Every repo should be able to find out what its host repo is.
