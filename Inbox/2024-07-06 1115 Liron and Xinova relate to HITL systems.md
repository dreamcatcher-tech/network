At a smaller scale, if we can extract the problems out of a company, it is better ? problems they didn't even know they had ?

We wanted to make apps faster, but we wanted to get solutions to problems faster at the same time.  If an app is a solution to a bunch of problems, then solving those problems is required before expressing in software.  AI removes the expression friction.

Wine seller app is again a HITL warehouse play, since they gather private data from merchants, and they improve the shape of their model and give it better responses.  But this data is unlikely to be available to other parties, and so they lose out on remonetizing it.

Wonder what other businesses are building up some value where human in the loop is part of their requirements for greatness.

We should be able to run a query against all these companies we track, and sample them in a new light, once we know a better way to look at them.
