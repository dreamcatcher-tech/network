we could have the full terminal, with stdin being actually legitimately connected up.

probably can only have one person in with the interaction part.

or we can allow others to use it too, but they would have to do enter one message at a time.

can have multiple people connected in read only mode, but first come, first interactive.

or, everyone can type, and the keys just arrive in whatever order, so you can both type.

So everyone is interactive at the same time.

can offer others to be view only, with readonly access.
