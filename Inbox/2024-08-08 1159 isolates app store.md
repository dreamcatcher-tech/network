publishing would likely just cause us to build a new deployment of our platform.
better than doing subhosting, since we want a more supple execution environment to build in, and without the overheads of subhosting deployments.

So we might make a regular curate list of projects, and then we load them live from B2, compartmentize them and run them securely.

Worst case we would periodically publish a subhosting project where they would be called on using an API.

Execution of the chain needs the isolates locally so they are quick to access.

Basically the usage of each isolate should be visible.

Easily see how it is going thru the testing project, and once a new deployment is created, it will publish.

Might publish them to jsr.io, so they can be easily pulled in from there ?
