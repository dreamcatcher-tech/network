The theory is that any other platform, which might be easier to get started on, because they had funding and built out a nicer entry, will soon falter as it doesn't share equity with others.

NPM should charge money whenever something gets used, and npm should take a cut of that.

whilst the json function platform is an industry need that anyone can fulfill, we can sustain it.  We need to dominate that space, by being first, by being best, so that we grow at max rate, else another player will take our fuel supply.

We need to indicate how we want our context to expand out with funding.

The dreamcatcher is the only business model that works for the platform being offline and decentralized.  All other models only work whilst connected.  Dreamcatcher is the only platform that makes profit sharing the norm, and sets the founding entities as peers, not masters.

It doesn't have to be on a blockchain, and we can just as easily make a non blockchain version.  It probably would be easier, but a blockchain has greater earning capacity, and is less vulnerable once standing.
