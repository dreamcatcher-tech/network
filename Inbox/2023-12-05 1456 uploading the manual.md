We could cause an autogenerated manual for every application to be uploaded and attached to the assistant, which gave all kinds of examples and instructions about how to drive the machine.

This manual could get updated as the tests get run, so that each bot modifies the manual if they think, after completing a task, that they could have done their job better if the manual was better documented.

Means we can nest functions more without relying on the descriptions to be included, so we can get our token usage down.
