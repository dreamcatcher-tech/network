We could cause an autogenerated manual for every application to be uploaded and attached to the assistant, which gave all kinds of examples and instructions about how to drive the machine.

This manual could get updated as the tests get run, so that each bot modifies the manual if they think, after completing a task, that they could have done their job better if the manual was better documented.

Means we can nest functions more without relying on the descriptions to be included, so we can get our token usage down.

Could also upload papers on advanced techniques and let GPT process this - not just embeddings, but section by section in the context of a particular goal like improving a given system prompt - give it a few books with some good ideas in it and then see if it can use any of that to get better results.

We should be able to showcase our best examples by taking snippets off the public chain and showing things that surprised us.
