this agent company seems essential to everything we want to do, since it will always be useful to any DAO or any other type of setup.

agent bridge, agent portal.

basically provides an mcp server into the real world, with expansion abilities to ask for more capabilities.

We help agentic systems interface to the real world.

acts as a semantic firewall to stop any poor behaviour of the tooling, which can cause reputational harm.  this should be built in, since we don't want anyone suffereing a loss from us acting a certain way.

the multi party proof thing should be expensive, and can be done by email, by platform logins using clerk, or by on chain means.

start with just smart management of actions of consequence, with human in the loop checking for awkward requests.

allows for a dao to control a twitter account.

this entity can start to act on behalf, like take legal actions, and do other real world things - like an embodiment of the agent.

daos are like virtual agents, since the take the will of multiplarty and act as one virtual person.

landing pad, grounding, ground pad, crashpad, touchdown, embodimint, consequences.ai.
services for any kind of entity -dao, ai agent, corporation, web apps - if you want actions of consequence without disaster, let us manage it for you.
- governance enforcement - require sign off for things that don't natively support multiparty sign off or chain of command
- actions of consequence that need protection

our features are an extraordinarily broad api, that is natural language.  we are an mcp server, ultimately, so any apps that can connect to this can take actions of consequence.
