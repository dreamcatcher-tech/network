If many small queries for AI queries are run on 3 computers a piece, and if the pool of who runs them is randomized, then surely all together they can form a type of pure work, where the computational weight of each plus the threat of minor slashing can be summed to provide a PoW chain like bitcoin ?

Then atop that, we can allow staking of the prior credits earned from the PoW.

If there is something like a mersenne twister allocating who gets what jobs, and there is some finalization period where hunters can find those producing false outputs, then surely

This is symmetric PoW, where the assymetry of checking vs doing is not there, but the checking serves a useful purpose in the form of redundancy.

The penalty should go up the longer you wait to announce bad behaviour, so the perpertrators never quite know if they're in the clear.

So you could pay for just single gpu, but this wouldn't contribute to global security.
And you could take the leader of the race of 3 gpus to get high performance plus resiliency.
