If any function can be declared stop on tool, then we should be able to handle that ?

In the config, indicate that a function is a stopOnTool entry ?

stop can be either stop and wait next input, or stop and pass on execution somehow.

OR treat switch as a special command that gets detected and has special impact on the loop that is running.



CAN the whole router function be removed if the loop() function covers routing from a switchboard call ?

So the longthread function only gets told to run the router agent, then all else is same as any other agent ?
