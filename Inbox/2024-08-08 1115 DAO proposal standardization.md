If they have some common areas, like projections and costs, then we can overlay multiple proposals together.

Break down proposals into smaller amounts, like atomic proposals, so we can assemble compound proposals from known good ground.

Then the proposal is a set of atomic proposals, with a nice human friendly summary.  Can change the summarization parameters to be fresh eyes, has inside knowledge, etc.

Can select your own lens as a preference and get customized displays.

Set your own values, and get the AI to guess at the way you would cast your votes on new issues.
