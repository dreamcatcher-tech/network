Have another layer of transclusion, where the text is inserted but is transformed by an AI step before being presented in the final output.  So it is more accurate than an annotation.

Be nice if all ai model generation could somehow give back their transclusions.

Make a version of xanadu where royalties can be set manually, since that just costs more token effort to calculate, but it can be released in this way.

Links can just be a form of ipld with some string ranges.
