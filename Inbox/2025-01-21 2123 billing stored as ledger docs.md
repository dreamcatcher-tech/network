If we store it in a ledger file, and make the updates using ledger tools, then this might be easier to parse for people ?  

Keeps it in a very simple plain text format that we can use.

Store each change as a new file, so to recover need to walk the history to get all the changes.

Allows for accounting, where funds are allocated against accounts.
