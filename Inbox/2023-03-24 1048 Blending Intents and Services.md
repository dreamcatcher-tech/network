If intents was set up to indicate what your intents were, and it calculated what you were capable of (travel time, travel type, range, people you want to see, cash, fuel) then we could also add in services to meet these intents.  People can propose services that suit them, and we auto match up with people who need things.  Generally for things too small or of low value that do not meet the threshold of full time employee.

Example is a parking meter at an event that has a long line - signal intent to pay for your parking, and someone who has time can do the payment and the parking, for a fee.

Escrow services to ensure payment changes hands, and allow actors to use google pay cards that can automatically front the payments for you.  Can charge a fee and use a pool to cover payment frauds.
