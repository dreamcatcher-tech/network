In our version, agents patrol releases, so we're always a little bit behind releases, but usually only a few hours, but we're often ahead on bug fixes, and we try merge back upstream.

What it means is that from our registry, nothing is really compromised, since we watch everything.

you can stake against the security of different packages, and you can purchase insurance against hacks.  This gives freeloaders confidence.

we also don't accept publications that weren't built from source.

you can create bots that are good at security analysis, and you can stake against what those bots say is good.

we also take requests, and can make versions of packages that are high quality, agentically coded, and supported.
