can expand to cars too.

so a dumptruck where each wheel is independent and can disconnect.

charging is by wire connections but if not charging then no used.

motors are all indepednently wirelessly controlled.

they clip on and off easily, with the direction of load being a stopper join, bend the otherway whilst pushing a clip and it comes off - used so someone can stand on it, yet still easily clipped apart.

spares are easy - make toys that last forever - these things have modular spares, swappable between all the different devices.

for a lifesized car, this can be the same too, where the wheel is modular, and has a motor in it, then just jacks in to the battery pack.

car is made of modules where each module is quite hardy, but easy to replace any piece.
