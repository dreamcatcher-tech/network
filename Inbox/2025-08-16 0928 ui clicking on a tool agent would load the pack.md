clicking on the repo button would load up the repo tools, and a bot with prompts to work with the repos list.  It might be muted in that it cannot load other tools, but it can switch to other agents.

So it is intentionally limited, but it is very good at what it does.

When you switch agents, that chat might be condensed and just added to context as a file that can be searched within, but it just scrunches down in the current context as a summary unless the bot asks to dig in to it.

It's there just so the machine doesn't lose track of whatever you've been talking about, and it can be done with other humans or channels, if you switch to being in that channel and then do some stuff or read some stuff, it goes in there, like a historical feed.

So these threads, they are like trains of thought - thought trains.

They represent your history.

so it could be actually a single thread ? 
when you start talking to someone, it captures what you spoke to them about, and what they said, and it knows what you saw there.

Because the nature of ai work is moving somewhere else bringing with you portions of the prior context, this mode suits best ?

so the history is a separate element, and the bots you chat with in the stateboard almost ?
the history seems like the transclude place / context management ?

having new history sessions is possible, but possibly confusing, since you did only have one thread, really.  so you could have incognito sessions ?
you could merge and summarize the sessions ?

This means we have to track it, and expose it to you, and let you modify it.

this timeline thing, should be where the ongoing conversation happens.
To manage your timelines, would be a chat to the timelines bot, and a stateboard piece that shows all the timelines in a tree so they can be worked on, like any other file.

Key seems to be looping the current session of anything into the current thread as context, by allowing it to see the files that the current thread represents.

You could go back into a prior context thing, expand it, like a previous chat, and pull in more context, to use in the current context.  This would show as a revist, and then the expansion actions.

reversing and forking should be captured too, where you went back and restarted from that point in time ? we just bump that to the front of the linear line, and point back to where it came from, as a restart point.   you should not be able to alter history other than to delete it.  It is created by what you do, not created by you doing to it.

It should allow you to wire up context between stateboards / sinks - so I should be in a group chat, and I can go wire up some files that stay live, or a jitter session, or even another chat as the context I am sharing in another chat.

All these data links probably need managing too.
