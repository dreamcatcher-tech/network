How to wait for these things to finish indefinitely ?

? Just keep waiting if there are no accumulations ?

A side effect should never be restarted - once running it must be allowed to continue to termination.

What if a side effect dispatched some api actions part way thru its run ?
Therefore, side effects must do nothing but their actual side effect results, else further accumulations will be lost.

Should be able to name all the interplays and combinations of continuation / repeatability executions.
