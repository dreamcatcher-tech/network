File with a central chain that makes it quicker for clients to trust.  The central chain does audits that all consensus in a chain was done correctly, and then signts the output.

Clients can check the central consensus signature, to begin using with less verification.

A chain can change out its signatories and then the old original members can say their fork is valid, shortcutting all the other agreements that were made.

But if the change was registered with the central tracker, this is harder to do.

Ultimately the client needs to check every commit leading back to the origin.
