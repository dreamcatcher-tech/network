the napp that does this call should map each call to a bot, where a bot is a set of config that is referenced from a library of bots, and that can be edited part way thru the conversation to make changes that are relevant only to this chat.

so you can tweak and customise a bot on a per chat basis at a particular point in time within the chat, or just stick with the default.

if the default changes, that would show up as an edit part way thru your chat, indicating the default got updated.

they types of schema mechanics are how we should program the system, and then put the UI logically on top, rather than struggling with ui first.
