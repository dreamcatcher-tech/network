When I click on my account balance, I would like a new chat to open that provides information about my account balance. The chat should include example buttons for potential actions, such as adding funds.

The system should recognize the payment methods linked to my account and assist me in adding a new payment method if needed. Additionally, I should be able to ask other queries, and the chat should have the capability to pull up relevant information from previous conversations.
