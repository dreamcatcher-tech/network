1. start up the side effect runner, using the provider napp, set to a fixed artificial scope that determines the host system we are running on
	this will call its mount functions, which will attach to the context
this returns a receive function, that can take actions in
context begins using its functions to create actions that are dispatched into the provider



receive of an action that is the client dispatch, will trigger the execution of this action ?
When the action comes in, its corresponding function always gets run using the asynclocalstorage callback.

Concurrency of calling.
These effects, unlike other options, might allow multiple concurrent calls to be taking place.

What does the regular container look like, if not the effects container ?

First we need the startEffectsContainer to boot, so we have the databases available.  This is what is used to set up the server.

If we allow concurrent runs, then the context you get might depend on the order you did things.
We could allow anyone to read, but we could synchronize the setContext function ?

OR we map the contexts between scopes, so they always are shared between runs in the same scope.
