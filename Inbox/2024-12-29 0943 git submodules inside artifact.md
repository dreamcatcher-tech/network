If at the top level you have a repo listing, then we could allow those to be grouped, or allow for submodules to be set up inside each one ?

Definitely start with just a flat list, and get fancy from there.

Once you're in a repo, that's where you can access all the files and the branches, and where you can attach them as context.

? can a whole repo be added as context to something ?

? How to reference your own home directory repo ?

? what do branches on your home repo mean ?
