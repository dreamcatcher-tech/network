the users would commit their operation stream, and the server would combine them to produce a canonical document.  This seems better than doing git diffing between them ?

so no party except the server modifies the reference doc, or, the reference doc never exists but is produced by viewers.  this could be linked to by using a napp to process the link, which would present out a virtual file.
