When in a remote session, should transport your mouse movements and theirs around, like it was a webrtc call, or using the broadcast channel to receive events.

Selections on the stateboard should be transmitted as well.

The events are a type of replacement event, so they can tolerate missing some messages.  Send a replacement every few seconds to combat this and keep everything alive.

So a remote session might be how we would analyze a test result.

It is a special case of the stateboard, where it displays the full UI in a modal window to give proper experience, rather than being cramped inside the hosting stateboard.

If both have a remote session pointing at the same thing, then can both have an independent session, on neutral ground, like a cleanroom.

Send voice to each other using this same system, so you have a chat and also have agents interpret.
