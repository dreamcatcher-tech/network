We should look for those that are similar to us, and clone their systems, demonstrate to them a revenue model for them, and invite them to merge with us.

We can offer them a way for us to do the plumbing work, their users to get started quicker, monetization for their efforts, a way to reward users, a way for users to publish their work, a way to be self sovereign over their data.

Joining with others makes us all stronger.
