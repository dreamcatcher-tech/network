Context should be attachable using filters, and be kept up to date, so it could be a whole folder, with a filter, but it could also be a meaning based filter where AI assess every time if it thinks there is a good reason to add something in or not.

The context could be attached intelligently, where you point it at a whole folder, and it changes the context depending on the task.   An intelligent sliding context window.

Then for subtasks it can do a set of parallel calls to reduce the context again, to choose the best information.

So in the tasks and the subtasks, when viewing the threads, we can see how the context was changed.  It can be changed by a human, but it can also automatically change as well.
