If part of system operations could be to look up a potentially large file with allowed PIDs, then we can provide tools to automatically manage large complex lists.

So becomes a bit of a toolkit for the building of large scale nApps.

move to having a folder for .io.json like .artifact and then store ACL in a sharded file structure to handle large amounts efficiently.
