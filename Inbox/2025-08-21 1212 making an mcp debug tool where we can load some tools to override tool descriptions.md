The issue is that when playing with prompting, publishing a mcapp is slow to iterate on.

if we provide a tool set that can write some modified strings as function definitions, 
this would put the mcp server into debug mode.
the resources showing the dbug status would be visible.

In this way, the human can direct the tool descriptions to be modified, or even an agent can run these, so it can run some tasks and have them complete.

debug profiles should be able to be saved to disk, and loaded up as needed.

warnings can be issued if they drift from the code supplied.

Bots can help massge them to fit the new things.

prompts may be used to send down system prompts that you may wish to use.
