if the snapshots were all was needed to recreate the app, then we can move and rename by creating a new app.

so if we can create an app from whatever state is stored in artifact, then rename is just kill the app, make a new one.

So we kill the existing app, then make the new one, which might be in a different org.

also we should be able to deploy in lockstep on two different orgs ?
