gives a way to make committed requests without causing a new branch to occur.
complicates things a lot tho, since tracking where the tip is becomes much harder.

? how to merge files back in to the parent ?
Need a way to get an api view to the files that were changed by the response.

Why would we allow loopback vs using a branch call ?
Less commits required to get the same result.

Execlock would just move forwards as far as possible until there were no more runnable things.
Tracking would map each accumulation back to the request that caused it.
This could be stored in a trailmap inside io.
