As the ability of AI agents to locate and contact people increases, a demand would rise for shielding systems where any incoming messages are screened by an agent and refused if they are unwanted. On the flip side, agents could be set up to crawl on behalf of people to seek out things that they want. These agents can be told about optimizations to their lives, like insurance providers, better mechanics, better ways to sell a home, and other types of hacks that were typically not well known due to the administrative overhead of engaging with them. The difference between the personal delivery of these services, such as insurance brokers, or as a generic automated form, may have greater success.

Underneath it all, there is a quality of service or properties that people want. They all know they want it; they don't mean to be sold on that. The bot can make these suggestions and optimizations that go about executing, and so all the hype gets removed from the system.
