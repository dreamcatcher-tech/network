I want a system where I can pull down a git repo and keep it completely independent from the thread that I'm working on, and then make changes to that repo and push them back. For example, an inventor's notebook where I am able to record ideas and develop them, and then what gets committed back to the repo doesn't include the thread that I'm working on. 

Optionally, I would like the thread I'm working on to be stored in a separate branch much like a GitHub Pages branch, a separate and different from the main repo so that if there ever was a need to do an audit of kind, then this branch could be used for that purpose. 

If I could do the system then I could replace the Obsidian app in my daily workflow. And use just our platform, regardless of the stability or availability of our platform, because the changes would be periodically pushed up to GitHub. Making sure my data is always available, and I have a backup method of accessing that data. The backup method could even be running the DreamCatcher platform in a local instance. And connecting to that repo.
