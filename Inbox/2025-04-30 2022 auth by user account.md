The issue is that the dids, to have multiple users, we need to make it possible to access other repos by setting some shared parameters.

So we would allow addition by user credentials like github. 
Then show the repos you have access to. 
Would need to be flagged somehow - might be a symlink to indicate we don't own it ?
Or just store it as a config flag.

When we verify the repo if we re-import it, we would check the ownership matches.

How should invites be received on the other side ?
Need an inbox that is filled with data structures like a stuck, so it doesn't clog your inbox and cost you forever data.  Or we could carry the burden, and you can view and choose the ones you want to interact with.
