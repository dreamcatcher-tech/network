set up multi layered advice, for jurisdictions and moral high ground.
moral high ground does a mapping of who is affected and what risks are occuring.

so if we have an ai in charge of a crypto project, it can respond to questions about legalities and other concerns.

so we should publish agents that are experts in giving advice on these matters, but you can also pay and have certified guaranteed outcomes too.

so we can gain following for giving this good advice, being a knowledge repository, and providing certification services.  this can flow on to kyc services too.
