Can be used to hit drones with a rifle.
Can calibrate so can use even cheap rifles, and factor in the characteristics of it.

Can be in fully automatic fire mode, where the electronic trigger fires when it has the best chance of a hit.

Tracks the objects, recognizes them, and allows simple selection.  Can use automatic selection for a fast moving target like a drone.

for distant objects, can track them, like as targets move around, it can stay focused on a particular one, if hitting one is more important than the other.

Can add scene conditions to trigger, like when a target is sufficiently clear of obstacles or other targets.  Can also try to target sections within a target bound, if some parts are more sensitive than others.

The screen can be just a smartphone, and the camera is fairly low grade.  A digitally stabilized image is shown at the expense of FOV.  AI processing can be on the phone.  Electronic fire just comes out the USB port or bluetooth or something.

Use a mechanical trigger which can be retrofitted onto any existing device.  The trigger can be trained, as it learns about the pressures required to fire, and loads the trigger to get the lowest response time for the lowest pressure.

Ideally an electronic firing system would be used, which uses current to light what used to be the percussion cap, or even the main propellant, with zero latency.

The assumption is that the time to fire is not affected by the meandering of the holder of the item to enough of a degree that the accuracy is improved.  Ultimate test is at a target range, shooting a fully auto and hitting everything.

Factor in things like barrel warp while doing multiple shots in succession.

Use an LLM to interpret voice commands for acquisition and execution to avoid pushing buttons.  Also complex scene conditions, like "next thing that walks past that window", "if target is stationary for 3 seconds".

Screen gives positional indications.  So can hold a fully auto in full fire mode at hip where it is stable, and it keeps shooting.

Buy a gimbal attachment that can move the item itself.

Network multiple cameras up so have wide view and narrow view to do acquisition of target as well as execution.

Drone mode, where when pointed skyward, anything that looks like a drone is fired upon.

Some ammo could be programmed to explode like AA rounds.  Some might be steerable.

System could use mic's to detect drone sounds.
