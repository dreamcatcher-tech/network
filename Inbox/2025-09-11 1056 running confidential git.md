at the extreme, if we trust the server to provide the latest git, then we don't need as much strength in the data structure ?

so our public blockchain could be accessible only via certified cocos, where the data inside isn't as verified as the servers that responded to your live request.

being able to download git and have all the signatures form the cocos attached, seems useful too, so I can verify it myself.

or when my coco goes looking for the correct version, i have where i was up to last time.
