Be able to have some open chats with the whole team and the developers, as well as bots that help solve problems.

When you have a problem, post the stuck in the channel.

Then other humans can go thru the chat, fork it, see what you're trying to do, and either take over the chat and make it do what you want, or they can work with you and with the system to get the outcome you want.
