Being able to design using a global network of ideas, and localized fulfillment also amplifies if we have AI generated designs, like being able to do cad based on AI models.

So the age is coming where anyone can contribute to a high tech product.

We can get a double amplification, since we have dreamcatcher making tech product development more equitable, we have the ai helping coordinate people and their information effortlessly, and then the final boost is ai doing some hard parts of tech - making the products fit Physics.  

So we'd be like a kickstarter platform and a mfg network in one, as well as a labour pool.
