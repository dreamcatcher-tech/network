appears due to the async context code balooning up with promises.
seems like each promise carries a huge amount of context with it each time, possibly including all the other promises ?

dedupe on adding any processed oid into the queue at all, not just sending to client.



could make the core execute under a single context ?  makes it special, but since it is core, this might be tolerable.

could make sure no new promises are enqueued until all the others are drained


reduce the promise explosion, then try turn the caching items back on, but using weak caches instead of strong ones.

useEffect is unmounting the effect, so we need to cancel it / abort it asap.
