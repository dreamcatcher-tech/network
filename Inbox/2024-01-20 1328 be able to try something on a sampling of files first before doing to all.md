It should be aware of how to rollback / discard the changes that have been made by destroying the branch or rolling back to a commit.

Then once it is happy with the sampling results, it can commission the bulk update to occur.

Might need a way to set a pause flag, like a .lock file to stop any modifications occuring systemwide.
