Being able to have a complete app as a thing - the project, the issues, the data generated, the compute - seems far superior.  Current projects deployed in clouds are very sticky and hard to move around the place.  If switching hardware was just part of normal usage, and it switches hardware technically multiple times a second, then you can never get stuck somewhere.

So seems building the GPU chain should be the top priority ?
Then everything the cloud providers provide of value, we can replicate it in a decentralized way.
So we would be a cloud provider that was entirely decentralized and running on blockchain with distributed hardware.  We would have some certified DCs but would also allow public hardware and highly untrusted hardware.  We would work to enable technologies like confidential computing to expand this model of trusted computation on untrusted hardware.

Ideally be a complete end to end solution for continually user improved no code AI dapps.

As the data from usage becomes part of the app
Used to be a clean separation between the app and the data generated with the app.  This is now the same thing and will be subject to harmonic motion the same as everything else in the world.

Allows for public fine tuning jobs to be done on the stuck loop, since a publisher of helps would be able to generate fine tunings for all the stuck:help pairs it curates, giving an instant response.

We can offer reliable unstoppable generation, without broken / failed API requests.  Particularly as the process gets snapshotted along the way, so the consensus swarm runs with resilience, and if doing more than a single run, if a member of the swarm drops off part way along, others can catch up quickly, so that the tip is always shared by multiple members.  Means that any one can drop and the process will continue reliably, even tho all members are unreliable.  The generation process can be purposefully throttled to allow reasonable catch up time without affecting output.  During live consensus we can checkpoint periodically where any catch ups can restart from part way along.  Leverages that a generation path typically takes a lot of GPU, and probably will always be comp heavy and slow.  Using this GPU energy, we can fortify the correctness of the network.

Phases:
1. HAL demo for the CRM showing the flexibility of the stuck loop and AI driving blockchain
2. Show a decentralized app being driven by a centralized AI, and generating stucks as NFTs
3. Show a decentralized AI driving a decentralized app
4. show an autonomous agent given funds to spend and no way to stop it

All along the way, show revenue back to the NFTs representing the tasks.
Produce a booklet that describes the process, and show the NFT representing the book itself.
Show the gantt chart of the NFTs we want to build out.


Means we need an NFT creator as the first thing we make.

Every piece of code running in its own isolation boundary.
Data sovereignty is always a wanted thing.
Endlessly growing memory that can optionally be shared is always desired.
Resilience of systems in the face of hardware and network failures is desired.
Vendor lockin is always abhorrent.

We should be able to, if we create the NFT system and the logic modelling system, be able to raise capital and convince talent to assist us.  Once we can do this, we can raise a pubco to boost our efforts.  Participants putting their mon

It is important to separate the effort from the pubco, since the pubco would be taking on liability if it was in control of the project - it is simply a powerful peer of the network.
