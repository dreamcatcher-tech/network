Being able to have a complete app as a thing - the project, the issues, the data generated, the compute - seems far superior.  Current projects deployed in clouds are very sticky and hard to move around the place.  If switching hardware was just part of normal usage, and it switches hardware technically multiple times a second, then you can never get stuck somewhere.

So seems building the GPU chain should be the top priority ?
Then everything the cloud providers provide of value, we can replicate it in a decentralized way.
So we would be a cloud provider that was entirely decentralized and running on blockchain with distributed hardware.  We would have some certified DCs but would also allow public hardware and highly untrusted hardware.  We would work to enable technologies like confidential computing to expand this model of trusted computation on untrusted hardware.

Ideally be a complete end to end solution for continually user improved no code AI dapps.

As the data from usage becomes part of the app
Used to be a clean separation between the app and the data generated with the app.  This is now the same thing and will be subject to harmonic motion the same as everything else in the world.
