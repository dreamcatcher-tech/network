ms application streaming means we could drive these apps directly in a container, with screenshotted logs.

If we watch how users are using the app, and look at the changes to the sql database, then we can gain further insights into how a replacement system should behave.

By watching these users, we can gain high confidence that our replacement systems fulfill all the needs without surprises.

Our watching agent would be active in the corner, and the user could erase anything they wanted.
