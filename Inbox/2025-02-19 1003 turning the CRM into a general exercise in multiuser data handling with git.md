If someone is editing a customer and that record is deleted, then we should warn them, and offer the ability to create it again.

We should allow for edits to be saved to artifact, but not yet be synced, so if the service is offline, they don't sit there waiting.
Each user should have an inbox, or an audit trail, where they can see the status of the commits they have made, and see which ones got rejected.
