we should only offer this as the only way we provide service, since it requires no trust of us.

we could probably optimize the containers and the software to be super performance as confidential containers.

we would then run a public blockchain using these attestation proofs.

it means that we can use bare metal hosted services without having to run these things ourselves, and they all still work.

so we'd launch on fly to get the experience right and validate utility, then when we move to get off fly, we would move straight to confidential containers.  If we don't, then we need to have trust in the hosters.  We would only be computing on price if we use our own untrusted hardware, but with confidential we have a point of difference, and can move towards public chain.
