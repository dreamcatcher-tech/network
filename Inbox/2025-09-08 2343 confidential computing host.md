we should only offer this as the only way we provide service, since it requires no trust of us.

we could probably optimize the containers and the software to be super performance as confidential containers.

we would then run a public blockchain using these attestation proofs.

it means that we can use bare metal hosted services without having to run these things ourselves, and they all still work.

so we'd launch on fly to get the experience right and validate utility, then when we move to get off fly, we would move straight to confidential containers.  If we don't, then we need to have trust in the hosters.  We would only be computing on price if we use our own untrusted hardware, but with confidential we have a point of difference, and can move towards public chain.

if we had coco, then we might not need registration, really, since we need no permissions ?
like you could just join, and then start running, much like bitcoin mining ?  no real setup, come and go as your please ?

if we are going to trust the cpu attestation anyway, then does it matter about anything else? anyone can join, instantly, and start earning once load flows to them.

being confidential also guarantees integrity, so even if no secret, then we can also know they ran with integrity.

the boot kit can auto connect to the chain and can be controlled by ai agents from that point on, including troubleshooting and provisioning.
