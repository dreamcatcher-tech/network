## Description[](https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/potentials/atomman/#description "Link to this heading")

AtomMan: the Atomistic Manipulation Toolkit is a Python library for creating, representing, manipulating, and analyzing large-scale atomic systems of atoms. The focus of the package is to facilitate the rapid design and development of simulations that are fully documented and easily adaptable to new potentials, configurations, etc. The code has no requirements that limit which systems it can be used on, i.e. it should work on Linux, Mac and Windows computers.
