so the model would browse around the mcp ?

so would napps be behind the mcp server, or in front of it ?

if they returned their commits, and a key indicating if they were repeatable or if they included or caused side effects, and possibly what those results are, then that can be included in the chat too ?

Could it be that artifact is just an mcp base ?

Present the web interface as an mcp server ? the models should be able to interrogate their own platform.
