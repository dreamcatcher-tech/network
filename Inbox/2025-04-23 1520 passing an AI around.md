If we could make our files actually be a bot which includes some prompting and some context, this might be more useful. We can build on that context as we interact with it, so the bot starts to absorb everyone's questions and comments. The bot may be upgraded by other bots that want to insert or update it with their information as well. 

Replaces the gdocs + comments flows.

Can suggest extra info you might like to add that is held by you, that the bots find relevant.
