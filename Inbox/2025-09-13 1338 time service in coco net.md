we need to be able to receive the attested time.

we could get signed versions of that from NIST ?

the core chain could have an opinion of time, based on its last known values plus activity that has occurred.

perhaps coco can be used for accurate time keeping.

it could hit the time servers, and use the certs from them ?

this is a good purpose for consensus, since we need to all agree on the time.

if all the host system times say x, then we can run with that ?
