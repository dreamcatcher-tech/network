We should be able to reason about components, and then put them on a sequence diagram / gantt chart.

Then we should be able to consider the order of operations, so that we can deal with making things go significantly faster by getting the order correct.

Might be able to attach tags to timing api, so when run in browser, we can then match up the sequence of operations, and see if the implementation is matching the reasoning.

We should be able to reconcile the reasoning with the actual code using AI.
