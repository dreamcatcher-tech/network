This is a system action, who should be allowed to call it ?

The branch should be able to call it, if it is permitted to run ?

So a full perm repo would allow the pulling of any repo that shared history with this one.

We should be able to set allowable flags on the function calls.

Pull should be possible remotely, otherwise would cause a commit on a chain that ultimately got updated.

Same with merge, as well.

Be able to pull only a particular path, like `helps/` so we can avoid merge conflicts.
Explicitly say we are going to clobber all incoming, or preserve all changes.
