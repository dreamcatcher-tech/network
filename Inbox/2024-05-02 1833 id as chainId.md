Home should be installed using a signature generated hash, so that it doesn't matter what engine it was started on or is accessed on, consumers can always verify that it is the authentic home that they wanted to use an

Same can be said for other critical services, like dns.

Home as a courtesy can provide a directory of common chainIds so everyone can find what they need to get started in hash space.

It should really be the hash of the first commit that contains signature information.

So a cloned repo from github would not have a chainId in our space ?

Or, just use the first commit ? trouble is that this doesn't really distinguish a unique path at all.

So a pure repo cannot have an id until we commit something to mark it?

It needs to be something that starts the ability to ensure that what follows is trusted.

It could be an unbroken chain of gpg signatures since we know that can't be forged ?

In the meantime, a repo needs a wrapper around it, so that without consensus in it, we can wrap round the outside and give it uniqueness in the system.

SO THEN we can ditch the account/repository part of the system naming ?
This should be stored in the config of the repo, and doesn't need to be anywhere else.

The addressing of the system need only cover a chainId as the root of trust and a branch.

The owner should be specified in the config file as meta.

Also branch names and consensus is not available on them, so that presents further incompatibilities.
