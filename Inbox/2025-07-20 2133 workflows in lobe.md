This would be a frame that let you see how the workflows were going.

Should be able to vibe up some napps and hook them up in workflows, and modify the workflows.

Common workflows, like research team, where you can tweak the crawlers and name them, and have them switch out based on different scenarios, so a selector in front of a team of crawlers, where it knows how to pick the right one.

When you say it did wrong, it can try figure out what it did wrong, and harden itself to never make that mistake again.
