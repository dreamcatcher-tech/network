If we handled paying for media content in a lawful way, then let people share resources locally, we could provide a strong need for mesh networks since the content would be much cheaper than anything else.

Starlink does not need to sell a connection to every household - they just need to maximize the sale of each cell.  So mesh networks can earn them local revenue in excess of the cell capacity, and deliver net at a lower price.
