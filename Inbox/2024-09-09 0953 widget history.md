If the widgets were treated like a stack, then a file explorer could open an agent viewer / editor tool.

A stack is better than having modals and other types of in place UI.  Stack is more like how the stateboard actually works.

Should use the stateboard as the way of using the messages thread to display more things, like the agent definitions should show up in stateboard, not in messages.
