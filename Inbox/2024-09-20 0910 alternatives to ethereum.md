Making an alternative to the Ethereum blockchain. By using The theory of patches. Each account on the chain is a single file and a rather large repo possibly sharded by file name And so updates that are independent of each other can pursue independently. Allowing for multiple Branches to concurrently operate. This allows the utility of a centralized chain but with the speed of consensus of multiple independent chains.

Or you might be able to modify this. Ethereum software to extract out the random DAO aspect And you said there's a means of reaching consensus between machines. If all we care about is the consensus of a hash or the consensus of a patch, which would mean that the consensus came around Concurrently, 4 independent patches

But might still have a double spend problem, since before accepting funds, need to know that no other shard also was operating on that account ?  Still needs to be a central pool that accepts all the patches together.  This can however be purely mechanical, rather than requiring individual tx verification and calculation.  So the limiting factor becomes the merge rate of the patches, and not the execution rate to verify every single one.

This would separate the tx processing time, for computationally heavy computations, since this can be done independently.
