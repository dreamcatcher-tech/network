this should be the way we build out the functions of the platform, all using this style of api.

it means that any new feature is a napp, with an mcp wrapper.

makes the codebase exceptionally modular.

so implies we need the concept of trees of mcp servers ? so a server can drill down into groups of napps that do a specific thing.

napps should be presented as a packaging format for mcp servers.

therefor, we need to figure out how to boot a napp and present an mcp interface to it ?
