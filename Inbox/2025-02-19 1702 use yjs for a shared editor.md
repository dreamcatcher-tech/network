If we let LLMs and people all interact on docs, we need to merge them.

This merging could be done using git, with a mergeDriver that uses the CRDTs to resolve differences.

So we can allow shared editing experiences, including several LLMs.

If we used automerge for the documents, then we could let people be offline and make changes, then they just come back together.

Or we just highlight the conflicts and provide views that people can browse the differences.
