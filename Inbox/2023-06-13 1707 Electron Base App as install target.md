Users would download an electron based client, which would give us native access to the filesystem, CPU, and GPU of the user.  This app can handle mining the platform currency, with different apps available to handle this interaction for you as you see fit.

Users can install applications from the app store and view what is installed the same as on android, with customizable launchers and home screens.  The apps as a whole can be chatted with, so the platform can use whatever apps it has, and can suggest other apps to you, so that it can accomplish the goals you set for it.

Multiple devices can be managed in this way, along with android installation targets.  One day if we are ever native on hardware, the whole OS becomes available for management in this way, so multiple devices can be managed in this way.

Devices from friends can be connected to in order to provide tech support.

If you are completely offline, other instances of this application are still available and can coordinate with you, and even trade with you if you do not trust them but you each agree what the last known balance of each of you were.
