external client seems best for testing napps, because provides a DID to drive against.

if it was transparent, then how would the did get attached ?

overrides go into the host container.

but we can make an mcp server with just the target set, so could skip the whole hono piece ?

the hono piece gets tested elsehwere, so we do not need to stack it for testing.

means people have to know about things like auth clients.

plus the harness is heavy af.
