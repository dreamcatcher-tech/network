Being able to watch all the heads change, locks come and go, etc can be made easy using the watch function of the KV.

Heads might be updated with a childcount or list of children in compact form, to be able to say definitively which children are active or not.

As soon as the pidlock is released for a given child, if it still exists, then it is definitely a child.
