If we make the stateboard have a compact view of the commit its on, the pid, latest or not, then we can collapse it up to an app bar

This means it can also be used to expand or collapse it on mobile.

Pack some extra info in there, and maybe let you change what gets displayed.

Maybe a mini prompt that uses gen ai to help you recompose the stateboard without altering the main display.
