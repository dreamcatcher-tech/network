 Some additional features that are required in the voice recording studio. Along with the waveform of the saved file and the size, we should also have the ability to scrub that timeline or potentially load it up into the main studio so we can apply tools like scrubbing when looking at segments of text I should be able to select multiple segments all at once and copy them I should be able to pause the recording, scrub it back and forth. So I guess it would be a concept of a focused recording.

This should work for long running recordings, as well as short instructional ones.

Connect up to a hardware dial or spinner, so can scrub back and forwards one word at a time.  Haptic feedback would be nice too.
