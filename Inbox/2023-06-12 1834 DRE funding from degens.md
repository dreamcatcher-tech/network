Degens seem to be trading NFTs just based on perceived interest, treating them like a stock.
If we bound some value to them such as task funding packets, then they might start their speculative activities on our packets, driving up awareness in the internet of driving pricing.

It may be that we do not need a pubco to use stock

If we could make a large task and sell a bunch of funding shares, that is all we need to do a raise for a particular task.
