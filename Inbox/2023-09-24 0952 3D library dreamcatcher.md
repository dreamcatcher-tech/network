Be able to download a 3d model, request some changes to it.
Ask for a model.
Stages where we have some verified prints done, with videos attached in a nice standard format that we can learn from.

So you can spec your model of printer and other params, and someone can design the file for you, then someone else can test and tweak the print.

Generative LLMs that can design models that match your prompts, but do so by modifying 3D models and then testing against knowable print parameters, so they are presenting things that can printable.  Can show their iterative process as the model is refined based on feedback from the modelling system.

Any time someone earns a fee for doing some work, all the dependencies of that model get a cut too.

Ideally want a toyshop where can buy lots of models for kids, particularly ones that can be assembled into other things.
