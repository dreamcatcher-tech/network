Be able to download a 3d model, request some changes to it.
Ask for a model.
Stages where we have some verified prints done, with videos attached in a nice standard format that we can learn from.

So you can spec your model of printer and other params, and someone can design the file for you, then someone else can test and tweak the print.

Generative LLMs that can design models that match your prompts, but do so by modifying 3D models and then testing against knowable print parameters, so they are presenting things that can printable.  Can show their iterative process as the model is refined based on feedback from the modelling system.

Any time someone earns a fee for doing some work, all the dependencies of that model get a cut too.

Ideally want a toyshop where can buy lots of models for kids, particularly ones that can be assembled into other things.

Machines that are designed starting with some crude constraints set up by hand, then from the first iteration sensors feed back info about how each model was used.  This is used to refine the constraints further, with more resolution than a human has time for, and based on real live usage.  This is then made into a new machine and the cycle of evolution continues.

Kits would be supplied as some base parts, plus the parametric model and the current state of the study.  You could feed your data in, or not.  You can change how you want things to be and see the changes take place.  Use prompting to get changes to the design rather than any particular tool.  Prompts can then generate some dials that give you more or less of a thing you asked for.  These can be tweaked in parallel, and relationships between them can be described so you can twiddle around.

Make some parts generally useable, like a computer that controls servos - the servos and power supplies could be all pluggable so that you can grab and reuse any, and make new things out of them, since the support material and software is all that needs to change.  Makes repair easy since the parts are so common and interchangeable.

Have a catalogue of things that you can buy, and a list of compatible manufacturing cells, pricing, lead times.  When you buy, first thing you get is an NFT that represents the lifecycle of the thing.  You can purchase before any of the fulfillment is possible, and in this case they look like a packet that has been chained together using a special kind of automated QA.  Mfg cells and assembly hubs if you want a fully finished thing.  Plus you can make yourself if you have the time.

The products are really little distributed computer programs and allow customizing by the user easily, with product sales incentivizing software development.

eg: some kind of fancy drum.  Can customize and put logos on it.  Can have it made locally and shipped quickly.  Can get parts rapidly.

Can ask for things that don't exit yet
