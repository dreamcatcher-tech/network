Build up models of people.
When someone wants to connect, they ask the machine for the best recommended way.
Then when they try it, the result is recorded, and we store that, in anon form, so the next time someone tries to contact them, we draw on this past info about the contact attempt, and say how likely it is that it will work next time. 

We can recommend how to craft messages that are likely to be met.

If we trained a model on this, then we could hide the data in the model, so it would never come out.

Ultimately, if the person being contacted wants to be contacted, they can set a flat fee, for which they will reply if you pay this amount.
