Maybe we can name branches as the parent branch plus the sequence that caused them to be created ?

We could skip the first branch name (main) and just use the sequence numbers to name the branches.  If we guarantee the monotonicity of sequence, then there can be no collisions.  Also the commit that made the branch is assured, also.

Names would look like `[account, repository, main, 0, 0-4, 0-4-0]`
