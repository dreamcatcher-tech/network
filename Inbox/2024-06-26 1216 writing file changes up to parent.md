Make a simple test that starts a repo, branches, makes some changes, pushes those changes back up to the top.

Demonstrate being able to scope to specific file paths being merged in.

Show how the parent repo has choice on whether to accept the merge in, rather than the child having authority.  The child is sending a PR request.

Handle conflict between two branches and show the refusal loop.
