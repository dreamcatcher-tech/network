opaque bottles with long ingredient lists are problematic - people are doubting them.

natural products end up separating and going yucky on the shelf.

people are more skilled and value long lasting tools.

if we sold a complete kit set, where you could purchase ingredients in standard little bullets, like little test tubes, and a machine could precisely mix up the potions, like a 3d printer, then you could have custom tailored costmetics.

can set up to do tiny little test batches as it lays down the mix.  saves a tonne of time.  people can share recipes.  Make custom for you.

Sell a remote printer services where we will run the printers and generate the results for you and ship them out.  Or if you have one of these printers then you can sell the service.  

Becomes like crafting but for potions.

so like a 3D printer, it gets loaded with all these cartridges, maybe a hundred, plus we sell more, and then it can create any mix, and any range of mixes, so you can rapidly test them.

simpler kits run by hand, where you use manual tools to achieve the same, and you follow instructions.

all these chemicals are easily purchasable and have no restrictions.

if we get influences to play with something they like, then we do all the product and launch.

can harness deep research showing what mixed things are allowed or not, good for what reasons.  AI can generate a tailored batch just for you.  Own your scent means you tasted and developed your own scent.

capitalizing on two things in the market:
1. making the natural nuance of natural products be their proof and strength, not fault, by spending more on the packaging, making it from glass, and allowing people to mix the products themselves, and positioning their shelf instability as proof of their naturalness and harmlessness.  plus reuse means no plastic waste.  pyrex tubing is recyclable by extreme heat.
2. allowing peoples endless desire to fine tune their products to be done for things like sunscreen and toothpaste and deodorant.  can be little tweaks to a core mixture or full experimentation.  sell a kit for sunscreen with instructions, but same kit can have other parts.  use a manual mixer for small batch, or mechanical for longer experiments.

Make ai models that can help figure out what mixes will be nice, and will be close to what you like.
almost like a scent model.

self mixing tunes of sunscreen.
make the tube clear, so you can see the product separate in the tube.
then have a plunger which is used to push the product out.  The syringe is refillable.
plunger has a valve so if you push it with the lid on, the pressure gets high and the product squirts thru, being mixed under pressure.  Pulling back on the syringe lets the product push back to the other side easily.

machines can apply heat as well as mixing.

could turn a lot of the cosmetics isle into really just a printer.

so instead of asking for a different brand, you just directly edit the mix, with the help of an ai model that also trawls thru other user feedback to help you diagnoze what the complaint you have with.  Can also post online and have people sell you solutions.

machine would use glass syringes, and have a wash station where it used water to wash the syringe before taking a dip from another cartridge.  or the cartridges can have little print head like squirters, like ultrasonic pistons that squirt the product out.  Cartridges could come sealed.

or, longer shelf life can be attained by separating out components and mixing on demand https://www.topfeelpack.com/two-in-one-mixing-launcher-cosmetics-double-tube-bottle-product/
