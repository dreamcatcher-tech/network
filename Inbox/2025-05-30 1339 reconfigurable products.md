i should be able to ask for an small config change, and the ai will attempt to fix it in software, and if in hardware will work towards it and tell me what it costs, then find others who would benefit from that too so we can split the costs.

We should be able to make products that have standardized computing models within them. So the compute module for a bread maker should be compatible with a toaster and all these other things. 

They should all have the standard software interface, upgradeable to get more software power. They should all be able to take microphones and speakers. They should all be able to be these different things.

A lot of features from the electronic world are very small, so even the bread maker should be able to be added with these certain things. Ideally, you would get towards appliances that were unified in their purpose or their function, and then possibly even get the CAD model scanned into bots so that they know how to use these things without any humans around. 

One thing is repairability and serviceability and lifetime upgradeability. So you should be able to get these items and just have them forever. You can spend a lot of money and have the really long-lasting chassis, or if you don't want to, you can have the cheap one that might break and might rust or something like that. You can repair it when the time comes, you can upgrade them gradually over time, you can swap parts in and out between other machines that you own, so that 10 machines with 2 are broken can be used to pillage parts for the others to keep them going. Maybe you've only got one total broken machine, parts would be forever available and forever being upgraded. Each machine carries intelligent sensors that feed back to a data source that spans all usage, so that we can immediately know and test new theories of what a new part is doing or how to improve the design. 

Manufacturing sales are set up around the world so that the parts are available locally and instantly as well as a local repair network of people who are familiar with the systems. You can courier them to these people who can work out of their homes or whatever and then you get your result back very quickly. There's serial numbers and chip identifications on them all so you know that your parts are genuine. When you buy them a royalty goes to the software and IP developers as well as an incentive to keep improvements coming. 

The mass of the device is always known, we know how much recycled value it has, its weight, its performance. We're always looking to see how we can shave off material but not at the expense of labor. Always looking for ways to make them more manufacturable and always adapting them for local climates or usage or local deviations from the core design. 

It's essential to allow a full integration of an AI life, where a machine is aware of all the parameters of all the machines that you're doing, can optimize your life, make things better, can also optimize for cost and can suggest modifications and upgrades. And can even ask for things that don't exist yet, to suggest that they should be built. 

Parts should really be 3D printable, so you can just make replacements yourself or order them from a local printer.
