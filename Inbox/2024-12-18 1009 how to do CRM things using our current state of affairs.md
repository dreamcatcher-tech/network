Might need to avoid big ticket items, like db work ?

maybe just use a postgres db to work in the meantime ?

has blown out the window the difficulty in making custom UI components - doesn't really matter nearly as much.  Maybe 1% the cost now. Plus its actually fun.

How will this affect our o1 integration ?

o1 should be brought to bear on solving problems like how to design the app, writing the code.

use artifact without any of the execution parts, so branching is just a manual external call ?
Then we can use it simply as a database with no execution on it.
