If we can get the ability for anyone using our platform to indicate when they are stuck or when they want something to be better, and show how that can be reconciled into an appropriate feature, or help show that a similar feature is in progress.

Then show how it relates to a particular napp, and how many napps might fulfill that request.

If we can demonstrate the modularity of our system, this completes the utility demonstration - if people could see how it could be anything at all for them, just like github can be anything at all.

Then, we can focus on demonstrating the attribution.

BUT is this all possible using artifact alone ? is it simply that the AI makes the usage of this system much nicer ?
