Set up globs in .io.json so can trigger an isolate to run whenever a commit occurs that alters a certain file.

Allows us to do watching on file changes.

Might be able to do watches on .io.json which would trigger on any activity ?
Could allow additional rules here, like where an action came from, what kind of action.

These would always run in the commit afterwards.

If nothing changed, do not require a commit.
