It should be that when a problem is reported or detected, that the models can do some troubleshooting including reading their own source code, verifying that they are looking at the source of what has been deployed, and then possibly making modifications to this source code so they can run again.

In a decentralized system, this would involve them running up some test environments of themselves, exercising it thoroughly, with some burn limits, or time limits, or some other thing like a very skeptical model, being used to choose to upgrade to the new system, making the system effectively self correcting, or self improving.

It does still take in ideas and energy from the outside world, but the cell wall - what it chooses to let in - this is important.

We should map out all the possible ways you could design a system like this, and we should make several working versions so we can have diversity, so that at least one will survive, and they might be able to help each other.

Once we can get them able to run their own code, and upgrade this by themselves, then we can hover, that is we can detach from our initial processes and hand over control to this self perpetuating system.
