from ngrok docs: Inspect the traffic to your server and replay webhook requests to iterate quickly while staying in context.

So basically, using the api gateway, we could replay all outbound requests.

ngrok might be good for all cli apps too, since it gives good hook back inside, rather than keeping a websocket open on deno deploy.

Share the requests to your service with others on your team. They can replay these requests with one-click and give you feedback instantly, accelerating debugging and improving your webhooks.
