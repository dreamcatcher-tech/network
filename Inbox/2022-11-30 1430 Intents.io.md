### Panic button
Get local support instantly from neighbours who are nearby.  Much faster than police or any centralized services.

### Needs shopping
List out your shopping list, those nearby can fetch it for you and drop it off.  Service fee is in dollars or in IOU's where you are owed the exact same service by someone.  Can either charge a high fee or the same service.  These IOUs can be traded between people.  There is some kind of call ability, where payment becomes due eventually.

### Favour tracking
Any kind of favours can be modeled, earned, swapped.

### money escrow
Paying for things on behalf of someone else is hard.  We would supply a service where we pay the funds and charge the other party.  If rules were not met we buffer the money.

This can lead to the ability to make short term loans to people who do not have funds available.  This too can be crowdsourced, with us taking a coordination cut.
