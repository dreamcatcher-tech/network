While the AI is investigating one thing for me, and it should take a lot of time, I should be able to ask another question at the same point.

If it has been going thru steps for the other query, it should be able to merge the two together, or purposefully keep them separate.  I should be able to say I want the results merged.

A good reasoning bot would have no difference in the quality of answer with late vs early questions.
