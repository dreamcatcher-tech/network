if the face knows how to talk to the agent server, then it can do a little more ?

the agent server should present itself as an mcp server ?  but this might have created the same problem that agents were intended to solve, anyway.

So if you land initially on the face of the agent, and it could be anything we like.

it could be a dedicated tmux face that is configured a certain way.   it could be a web page face.

the face needs to speak face protocol.

but what is the unit of use we are solving immediately ?
- agents that can be sysprompted
- agents that start with a git repo

we know we have the unit of coco, which is what we are selling, or promoting.  One use case, is with the agentic computing model.


power user v1
- land on base page, get presented with a dedicated codex terminal, and a specific git repo.

make a new codex face by using url params which act as args, so you can prompt the agent faces ?
can list all the faces on the agent.
