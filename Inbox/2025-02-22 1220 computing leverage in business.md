With enough context, the AI should be able to calculate a model that can give us things like posture, leverage, success chance, yield, and other scores.

We could ask for any kind of dashboard we want, and these things would give it to us.

Be always calculating expected yield, and showing what events we could induce that would have high yield.

Then be figuring out how to minimize taxation on those gains, plus feeding in our world model, and seeing how things will change in the future.  So with this, we could run not one business, but every business - a general activity management system, that had only one goal - revenue.

Spot combinations and arbitrages, where seeking other capbilities would pay out very well - a guidance system for activity.  Unlock yield due to coordination.  Figure what capabilities to acquire.

Could turn this in to a game, so it could be played at an accelerated rate.  Also play history to see how we would have fared historically.

Chat about new ideas, also crawl twitter for ideas as well.

Chat with the system, give it feedback, run scenarios.  Each chat you have, it learns more about how it could think later.

Team up with friends and share ideas and discussions - multi operator.
