If we make it with mcp tools, and the game is to get the mcp tools to trigger.

so you can read the files in the ai, and you can browse the files, but only if the bot things, will it call the mcp functions, which generate new facts.

tmux gets set up so it only ever runs codex, and it runs with some limited approvals modes that you can't change ?
So it runs as a specific user, and then you can't bust out of the system since you're only that user.

Each session could be a unique user, to avoid cross chat modifications ?

have a front end chatty fast bot, with no web search tools, then call specialized agents once the job is clear.

make a web relay to make the openai requests, so that we do billing here and keep the api keys secret.

ingestiong pipeline where screenshots can be put in to the repo too.

welcome banner displays always and says the limitations of the current system.
