eg: starting a bank from zero repo, built entirely with AI, should be significantly cheaper to run than any other competitor, and starting from zero, plus direct integration with other AI first ventures, means customers from first launch.

Basically this would be an API only bank.

Could use it to store your personal info, and then authorize withdrawls and balance checks.

Any company that can be crowdsourced for capital and ideas / labour with zero admin overhead, always pursuing the best idea, instantly - this company should surely outperform all others.
