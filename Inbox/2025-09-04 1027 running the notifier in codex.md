getting told when the agent turn is complete.

In this way, we know the job is done.

but this means we have a special mcp server for codex ?

so swapping out the header of the agent, means that to converse with the agent, you would need the right type of mcp server ?

we could make the mcp server have a standard interface, but the implementation in the agent can be swapped out, to be codex, or whatever.

running tasks seems always the same.

the caller side mcp server can just proxy thru the agent tool calls and descriptions ?
no, seems has to be the same.

result of the job would be just the agents final message ?
