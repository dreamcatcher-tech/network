They need credits to be able to run.

Our token could be the lifeblood of these agents to run, since each token would give each agent some kind of token expenditure.

When you pay in token units, it represents the compute and storage costs, but is also the token cost of running a model.

The lifecycles are:
- creation
- spawn - parent breaks in to several children, possibly destroying itself
- merge - multiple stucks agree to merge together to create a new stuck
- absorb - a stuck recognizes a duplicate and surrenders into it
