If we set up a pen testing AI powered service, then beyond selling tools to do pen testing, and help you fix issues, and do monitoring, we can also offer insurance where you pay a monthly fee and get service level guarantees back, with insurance payout if there is a fault found.

So we could provide the AI testing at cost, but then the human assisted guarantee costs money, and is a two sided gamble.
