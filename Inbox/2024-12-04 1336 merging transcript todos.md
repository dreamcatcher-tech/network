add in the concept of being able to represent many different use types:
- dedicated app for a single customer
- processing napps in a pipeline
- voice puck agents
- web apis exposed over the web
- crypto mining / pooled inference
- act as an ai music player

suppose we would just change how the front end walks thru the auth flows to operate directly.

make an interface to show that the UI reasoning can support all the activities that the dreamcatcher required ?
Might want to list out actions as things it can do, vs widgets / areas, which is where it displays data and offers actions.
Means we can think about the app in terms of what actions it permits.

Then show if it can support everything required for the UI, too ?
