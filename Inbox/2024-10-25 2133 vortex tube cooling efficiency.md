If the compressor was outside, then further cooling is possible by cooling the compressed gas.

So we would induct outside air ambiently thruout the house, or, from the outside, and then only blow in the temperature changed air.

So air is fresh, pressure is positive so no dust comes in.

Might not be that inefficient to do this.  Huge advantage is the lack of moving parts, and the cheapness.  The reliability would be extreme.  Maintenance would be simple.

Mixing with swamp cooling might give further benefits, as the compression could dry the air.

Should be easy to make a lot of them.

No gases, no plumbing, no split units with some part outside.

Could be very compact.

Vortex can be used to filter the air finely, like a dyson.

Compressors as flexible belows style, so large and slow.
