? What do friends look like in the Jitter world ?

"show me all my friends"
"show me who is nearby to this problem"
"see who will be in Singapore on the 15th"

Is this just the contacts app ?
It should be able to extract friends from many places, like peers in torrents that I download, people who ask similar questions, subscribers to my youtube channel.
