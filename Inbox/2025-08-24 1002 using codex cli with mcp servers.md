this could run server side as a mcapp, and use artifact for filesystem and branch access.

so we could have concurrent agents running this model.

maybe their mcp tools could be used to provide additional functionality.

we could run it on a real filesystem, which makes for zero setup overhead, and then use actual git diffs ?

filesystem watchers can show the changes live to a web browser.
