whichever level you're at, you can see the messages for that current thread, and then the calls that went off to somewhere else, or another agent, or a group of agents, and then see the messages in there too.  

These agents might read from the work of other agents, which would show as a symlink ?

composable views, so you can ask to see messages for just a particular agent, so you can ask for complicated things in english, rather than having complicated UI functions.
