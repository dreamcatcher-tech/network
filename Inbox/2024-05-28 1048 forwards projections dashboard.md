If we could build a tool that incorporated all our forecasts, then we can justify our behaviour as things that improve the outlook.  Others can assess whether they believe the assumptions in our model, and they can play with their own values in it.

What the plan was at each point is always compared with the actual state of things.  Start up a market so people can place bets on the forecasts to show where they thing things will go.
