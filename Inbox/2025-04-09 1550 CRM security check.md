If we generate an aes key on Steves machine, 

basically if we fully manage the fly.io org on Steve's machine, this is the safest possible way.

so long as the token is set randomly, generate on the safe machine, and the decryption key, and the deploy token is set, then my github account is safe enough ?

If a separate fly.io org is set up, with independent billing, and separate keys, then having the keys stored anywhere other than Steve's computer is avoided.
