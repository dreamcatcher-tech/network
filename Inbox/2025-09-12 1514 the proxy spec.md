make the hosted app not care that its at a subpath, so it thinks its at the root
but we need to allow it to request child subpaths, and for us to know that the request is not supposed to be for a child agent, so we don't get a collision.

we need to:
- Rewrite request URIs and headers to upstream root.
- Rewrite upstream redirects and cookies back to the public prefix.
- Optionally inject `<base href="/prefix/">` for server-rendered HTML.
