Whenever Smax uses the system, review what he did in those threads, and make refinements to the system.

Perhaps make some bots that can look for similar patterns, like files being called multiple times.

Then can report back on fixes where a percentage of uses were now improved.  The changelog can do a summary of the types of errors we were focused on, and which were added to tests, and which are now fixed.  The changelog should point to the test data that was used, as well as let those threads that were used know about the changes somehow.

Need a tracking system to manage all these stucks and problems, and have references to the source data that helped me see them.  Gives better requirements management and scheduling.  Plus can put bounty against different stucks.
