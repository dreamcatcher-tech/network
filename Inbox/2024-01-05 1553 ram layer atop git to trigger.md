If we put a ram layer, it can act like the crisp, where you can subscribe to a path.
Then, we will give you the file at the path, in complete form, and will trigger a new prop when anything changes.

Ram can be persisted periodically, to reduce FS thrash.

The crisp would be staged, so we can see when it is in ram, on disk, commited, off computer, part of mainchain - give people visual cues as to the current durability progression of what they're looking at.  Can show netsplit too, when we have lost connection to the swarm.

If we coordinated with git, we could do status much faster too, since we would already know whats changed.
