If we get the stuck loop going, then we can load up on what stucks are, and write them in natural language ?

Then we can start to write helps that give us good behaviours.


? Testing loops ?

If we set up a test loop, when active, this starts watching the filesystem for changes, and reruns on change, or when instructed to.  Can be run with named filters on what helps to execute.

Things like 'reset the session' seem better provided as using the stuckloop rather than individual functions, so we would have a general way to add new functions to the system, rather than continually expanding the shell.

Hotkeys would call a dedicated failsafe help.

Make a UI element that loads up and shows what features the system supports.
Also can ask what it can do, and it will show this board again.  If you narrow down its functions, the board will narrow too.  If you suggest something new, then it will be registered in the system and you can check up on it periodically or you can be notified when it becomes available.

This means that on blank systems, you can ask for how to do things and get someones attention about them.
