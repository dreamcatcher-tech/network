If we get the stuck loop going, then we can load up on what stucks are, and write them in natural language ?

Then we can start to write helps that give us good behaviours.


? Testing loops ?

If we set up a test loop, when active, this starts watching the filesystem for changes, and reruns on change, or when instructed to.  Can be run with named filters on what helps to execute.

Things like 'reset the session' seem better provided as using the stuckloop rather than individual functions, so we would have a general way to add new functions to the system, rather than continually expanding the shell.

Hotkeys would call a dedicated failsafe help.
