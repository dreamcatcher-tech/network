So they log in using privy, and then each request they send it has a signature from the embedded wallet in it.

From there on, the user is only know but the public key of that signature thruout our system.

They can attach multiple pubkeys in there.

But it means we do not need to check anything else, other than the validity of this signature.

The wallet infrastructure will ensure that the key is kept secure from all.

Avoids having a web2 auth process going on.
