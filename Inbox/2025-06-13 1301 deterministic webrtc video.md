If we held the high quality source, then we should be able to prove that the partial adaptive bitrate packets were derived from the original.

So we would capture the packets from the voip stream, and then they first of all have a signature we can verify, but we can, upon receiving the high quality version, determine that they were generated correctly.

So we get the urgency of any signal at all, but we can determine if they were actually genuine later, as well as the high quality original being part of the committed repo.

The principle is that repos should contain pristine data.

Same thing is doing a plex like stream, where different compressed forms can be deterministically produced.
