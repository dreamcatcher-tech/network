Be able to suggest things that you want, and approx ways to achieve them.

Can do many things on Satoshi Island as the need to coordinate for supplies is strong.  Requests for items in the store can be made ahead of time, so that everything you want is ready when you arrive.

Good to concentrate many separate desires for items, such as taxi rides.  Takes weak and diffused connection and strengthens.

Inverse intents is when you wish that someone else wanted something, or want something for someone else.  This can be wishing that a council would fix a bus route, or a pothole, or wishing someone would want you to go get them a cup of coffee.
