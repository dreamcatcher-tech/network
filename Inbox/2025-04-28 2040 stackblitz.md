we can install `@artifact/api` because it only has npm deps.
but packages that have jsr deps seem to bomb.

would be great to publish npm packages based on the jsr tarballs, but with deps rewritten ?

Is this piece needed for anyone to vibe code with our tooling ?

optoins:
1. vendor the jsr deps, including those in the workspace, and publish to jsr
2. copy the node_modules folder with its installed files into the stackblitz project
3. build a library using esbuild or vite
4. see why dnt didn't include the jsr packages
