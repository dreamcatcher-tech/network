Electron based app that has an app store and acts as an install target for our apps.
Install chrome with the recommended extensions already in place.
Let it run as a sharing node that can donate resources to genpop or to your company.

App store, list of loaded apps, tabs for each app, debug / backstage mode for each app.

The electron build can serve as  a single app build for those who want to publish, or can be a multiapp OS for those that want extension to be possible.
