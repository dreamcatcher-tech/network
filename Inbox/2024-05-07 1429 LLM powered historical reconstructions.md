Show alternate versions where there is discrepancy of information.
Differently, show alternate versions when their is uncertainty, since not enough information can be filled in many different ways.

Eg: reconstruction of the normandy landings.
We should be able to see it unfold as was documented, and based on interpreting actual footage.
Move around in VR, jumping between map and on the ground locations.
Camera in midair with a line and a length, or if you hit something, like a plane, jump you onboard it.
Each item at each time can be interogated to see the proof of its position in the scene.
Each item has rich history attached, like the people involved, what happened to the rest of their lives, where their grave is, etc.

We should be able to show that every single person has been accounted for in the footage, and we should make virtual placeholders to cover those who we need more info about.

This same tool should be applied to modern wars, where there is lots of high resolution info and where we can get info to be gathered since things are still ongoing.

All the mini scenes should have impact crystal calculations as events unfold of varying severity.
Impact crystal views should be available for all points, and all people.

Any point in time should be referenceable in this way.

PLAYING THE RECONSTRUCTION GAME
Entering VR and piecing together puzzle pieces is valuable.  The AI resources your pay for and expend is paid back to you as others consume the finished work.  Form teams and let some people bankroll the credits for other people to theorize and build out the construction more.

So the basic version is just an overview of the model, and the tools to pull in footage and use text to build out the scene, share models and see veracity / liklihood overlays.

Can be used for crime scene reconstructions and alternate timelines, giving people VR access to famous murder scenes.  People should turn up and take 3D scanner versions, or use loads of photos to blanket a scene, then crews get to work with AI assistance to build up plausible scenarios of what happened.

The AI can build up a case, and say what is required to go beyond reasonable doubt, as well as put thru arbitrarily wild theories, and let anyone suggest a case.

This is much more fun and engaging than a raw history lesson.  Makes them think about why things occurred the way they did, teaches verification of data, builds something lasting - these are skills that transfer to every single area of their lives, which is what history is supposed to be about.

Reward people for spotting inconsistencies.  They could chat with the machines and ask questions about inconsistencies.  Marks would be awarded for finding something new or missing, or finding an inconsistency, rather than a fictitious exam.  Those rewards can pay out to them in royalties, or in escrowed money.

Battles are one thing, daily life is another.

Can let them experiment with how things would have gone if some aspects were different.  The exam could be a fictitious change, and the students have to figure out the impact of those changes, with the help of AI, and build out a new alternate model.  There should be a list of genuine alternate realities that everyone has agreed might have happened, and the students need to build those out more.
