using drone swarms to make a cloud of HE so any incoming thing gets hammered by these little explosives.

The drones can move out of the way after dropping the payload.

Payload could be in a low powered gun, so it gets shot a small distance, which means the drone does not need to move that fast.

Drones can swap in and out.

Could fly with wires attached for continuous power.

Probably works against any sized weapon.
