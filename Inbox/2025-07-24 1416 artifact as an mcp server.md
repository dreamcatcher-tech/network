it might be easier to integrate the transcludes with an mcp interface ?

then the model can crawl thru data without context stuffing, so it has broader context ?

then artifact acts like an mcp server host, a big one, and the ai models make calls to it ?
in openai, they could be hooked up directly, for speed perhaps ?

all the tools might be better as mcp ?

then we might be able to integrate directly with lobechats mcp system ?
