There are always so many options that exist for any given path or timeline.  A bot should manage all these alternatives, and should be able to explain why the best one was chosen.  Everything is expressable.

guiding a bot thru discovering the viability of different options should be easy.

So we always have multiple concurrent plans, and we raise alarm bells if we do not have viable alternatives.

These bots should always be managing the strategy, and making suggestions on when to switch paths.
