HAL can be asked to demonstrate the usage of itself.  It would either do that using the chat window where it acts as the user in what it says, or it would render the 3 window discourse inside the stateboard, and emulate what it was saying and doing inside the stateboard.

Then the top level discource can be used to guide the internal discourse, and make it change in different ways.
