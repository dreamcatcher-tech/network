It's almost like for complex subjects we need to keep the dictionary and some reasoning around so that whenever we submit a code request in, these definitions of concepts are the key thing that gets applied. The extra little rules that we add, ideally they'll be used to update those concepts on the fly, but having a separate set of rules however they got there, means that the generated code follows the architectural reasoning that gets laid out and so it will start to feel like it's more deeply correct because it has a an understanding almost of how the design is supposed to be. And so the reasoning folder about the construction of artifact is something that we probably need to get built. We might be able to make a conversation invigorating machine that uses the Realtime API plus some deep reasoning O1 calls to be able to generate questions for a conversation so that I can just talk about them briefly and informally and then have a one update and reason through the records about them.
