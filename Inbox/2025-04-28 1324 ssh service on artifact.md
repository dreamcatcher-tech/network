the cli would artifact backed, so you're always in a repo, so to speak.

you could have access to shell commands, but the filesystem is artifact.

the shell commands can also act like napps

You connect, and we bill per minute at a very low rate, or you can be terminated on idle.

We just proxy the commands back to the main artifact infrastructure, so this connection just looks like the same as web server connection.  It allows a shell for those who feel comfortable, but also allows machines like git to do ssh commands after you add your ssh keys to your account.
