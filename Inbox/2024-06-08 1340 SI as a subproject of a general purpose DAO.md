If SI was an incubated project, and Dreamcatcher was an incubated project too, then they become peers, not a heirarchy.

The DAO specializes as a real world gateway service, where the will of the DAO is enacted in real world interfaces with guarantees like power of attorney, member of the bar being a representative, multiple legal signatories required to do actions, etc.

Means that the DAO can immediately have trust that its actions will be carried out.  This top level specialized in trust and in self correction, like how a cloud provider guarantees you a virtual machine with minimal downtime.  The service charges for each request, and handles its own corrections internally.

??? Could we list the DAO, or a DAO project, on the CSE stock exchange as per [[CSE listed Public Company]] ?

Or we could have two DAOs - a for profit and a non profit ?

Depending on who paid what fees, we could set up a top level DAO and run the dreamcatcher as a project, as well as SI.  Basically aim to save on registration fees and upkeep of company resources.
