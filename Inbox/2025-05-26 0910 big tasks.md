get the frame relay system working.

might need to build that in focused pieces, lifting up a piece of functionality at a time.

move blob methods to GET to take advantage of automatic caching.

use pack files on the server.

tigris caching should use the http cache since it is all gets, and it should synthetically cache puts so it never needs to read again.

the client using the browser cache would be useful for cli apps as well as browser apps.
