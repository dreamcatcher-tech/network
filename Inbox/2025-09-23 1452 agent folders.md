seems we don't always need a full blown agent but we would like a grouping path ?

this is like saying that some paths have agents at every directory, and other don't ?

or, is it like, the `/server` agent is responsible for receiving inbound requests, and it will create new agents for each new browser session that lands ?

just seems better to have a single hop, where the bios adds these new agents ?

the agent could be simply a pass thru where it exists solely as a folder placeholder, not actually an agent ?

so an agent folder seems legit, as it might not be anything ?
be nice to spec the filesystem as a json schema.

so putting agents at paths is allowed.
