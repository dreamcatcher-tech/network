if an agent is booted that has access to this level on the nfs server, then an mcp tool could be used to list these repos, and then to set them up ?

the workspace could do git clones manually, but the preferred setup way is with the mcp server since that guarantees any optimizations are applied.

pass the repo as part of the config just by name, but optionally with a path, or a commit.

pass multiple times if want the multiple files ?

with a pass means not the actual repo ? might allow history of that path ?
