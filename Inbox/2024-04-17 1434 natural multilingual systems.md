If everything was AI processed, then we could make business systems that multiligual speakers can interact with together.  If something is not clear, they can ask questions of the system.  Things there were not clear in their language can be added to the kb for their language, and the machine does not make the same mistake again.

So clear and intelligent information with lossless translation between languages.

There may be a common language that the machines derive that is better for them, and this might be vectors.
