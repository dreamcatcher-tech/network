Be able to take the postit notes priorities we made and make that be laid out in a way that AI is used to build out each item, and arrange our priorities.  It should also run reducers on them to reduce down the similarity between them so they are orthogonal.  Should seek competitors somehow ?

3box editor so we can improve each item ?
