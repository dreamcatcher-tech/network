If one of the drivers of all interactions with Stux is to extract out facts that the user has given us, and store them as atoms, then use them to respond to different queries.

When the user sleeps, we can grind thru all facts and search for conflicts, and update any corollaries that might require change.

Goal of a conversation can be listed too.
