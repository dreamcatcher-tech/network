Use gigabytes of json under management, as well as stats on binary.
The more data we are managing, the more valued the chain is.
Also can score this based on consensus levels, so multiparty consensus, commercial grade hosting, etc.

Transaction processing in terms of tx / sec but also GB/sec - how much data is being processed by the system.

Long running operations, so we can measure the time to do a commit based on the number of commits that have already occured.
Could just run ping pong for as far as it can get in a certain time, and see what the result was.
