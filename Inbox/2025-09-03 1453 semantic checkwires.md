in a project we depend on, like codex, we want to know if something meaningful changes, like if they suddenly start honouring mcp server instructions.

to do this, we would set a number of checks, and then each commit that comes in, or a group of commits, we would look at the codebase and check if the assumptions are still correct, and we would raise a flag on the dashboard if it wasn't.

we might take notes and store them about places where we found info we need, or ways to shortcut the search next time.
