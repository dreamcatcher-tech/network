we need a micropayments system to enable ambient attribution.

there are some special properties of the currecy, like being able to accrue without dispersal, since true micropayment features allow sending payments that are of less value than a single transacation costs to process, so it allows payments to be accumulated and then batch processed when the amount becomes meaningful.

Xanadu was part of a larger whole - a system of complete ambient fairness - and it touched on enough of that system to make it hard to build without enough to make the whole thing.

Its overheads might have eclipsed its value were it not for AI.

the web is an even lower form of this, and the internet lower still.

we could rank these systems based on their ideal so we know where each one stands, and we can highlight the ills of stable systems that do not meet the full potential, which is either supressed value, or uneven distribution of supressed value.

the systems are so cheap to hold up that distorted concentrated supressed value is sufficient to

ambient attribution also considers full context - self referential context - it also considers the contribution to the attribution that the system doing the attribution contributes.

It also recognizes that the system performing the attribution actively contributes to the resulting attribution.
