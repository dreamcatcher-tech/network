Should have a dropdown of the napps that we are going to use.
Then a special chat that can let you modify that list, derive new chats, set up a one off chat, or save it permanently.

Lets you set the initial context of the chat in a reusable way, where the context includes the napp that you are talking with.


If you can now switch being between napps and context while running, does that change anything ?  As in, should the context be switched at all ?

So switching mid chat doesn't make sense, and you should start new chats using the context dropdown.

Once you start chatting, its locked ?

You could change it ? but we would need to make a tool item showing that the context changed.
If you set it back, or delete that context change, then it goes back to how it was.

Is this interface enough to:
- use the CRM system ?
- provision and manage autonomous agents ?
- edit and deploy napps ?
