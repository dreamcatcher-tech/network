If the whole interfaces was purposefully make to be accessed by string path, the schemas, and the providers could all be instantly looked up from the action path.

If the keyspace was flat instead of nested, this would not be a problem.

Then we can use typeguards to set the values.

We could keep the isolation of the provider implementations by the way we attach to them.
So they could be addressed by a two part key, which seems simple ?
