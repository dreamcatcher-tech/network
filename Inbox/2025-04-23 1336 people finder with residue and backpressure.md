Many businesses and components of businesses rely on making contact with the right people, preferably in a way that doesn't bother them. 

Be up from being contacted about offers or upgrades to their life that they actually want that make their lives better to them demonstrably.

If we made an AI tool that can hunt people down, then we can also hold the data about that as a central database.

Then if people actually want to be contacted, then they can use our system to configure who they want to contact them, then we start to become the broker.
