If we could parse the pomo app and get actual time burnt, then we could estimate actual time spend on a particular module, and even break things down inside that module.

Typically, commits occur when something is 'done' or a point that we'd like to roll back to.

Renaming and deleting files means a lot in this model, much more than it ever used to.
