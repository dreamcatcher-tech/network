If a little mini program can be written in NL and executed reliably by an AI, and some funds were put against it, this is smart contracts as originally intended, allowing rapid collaboration in a trusted way with others, where everyone understands the contract, and it can be suitably complex.

Removes much of the need for lawyers, as advice on how the program gets executed is ingested into the global knowledge set.  Probably would be less buggy than solidity.

TLA+ model checker gets run in parallel, too.

Decreases the feasible size requirement for a smart contract to have been made, since can make many little agreements.

Can make open ended agreements that get ruled on intelligently.

Can have a fairness rules on the contract before it starts.

Can discuss scenarios with the contract and make those public so others can see how it behaves.
