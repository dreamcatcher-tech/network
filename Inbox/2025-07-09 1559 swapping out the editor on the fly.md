If you start by just writing up a doc, and then want to change it over to being an email, the bot should be able to change the frame,

So the current frame can swap often, so we might want that bonded to the chat ?
Or make it be the home frame, or the current session ?
Allow new session frames ?
Have a frame that is bonded with the chat, so you can click that and go back to it, and it shows the current jitter.

when we have group chats, the group chat needs a way to show each individuals canvas that they are sharing.

Or make a dedicated button that shows the canvas tool, which is whatever the chat has decided to load up.

The chat view could be like the transcludes - if the bot changes it, you can see it in chat, and you can click on it to view it.
Make it view as just the chats frame, so back would take you to all chats ?
Or, underneath it is the transcludes frame ?
