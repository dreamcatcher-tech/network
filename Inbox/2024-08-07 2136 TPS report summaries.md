Would want a discussion about the failures that occured and why they might be occuring.
Suggestions for modifications would be useful here as well.

Also need to show token cost, dollars spent.

Say equivalent in human hours spent testing too.

Show graphs over time
 - number of tests in the file
 - number of passed or failed expectations
 - stack the lines so per test and overall
 - comment on the change to the expectations

There is no variance in the before blocks.

This report should give all the info you need to feed back in to the creator bot to try make modifications to the prompt.

3 recommendations, one sane, the other very high temp.
