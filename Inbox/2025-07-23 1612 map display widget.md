Just to demonstrate the capability, we should make a map widget that can be used to display times and distances between two points. So that you can ask about something, and the bot will determine that a tool that it discovered with a frame is the best way to express the answer to you. It then comes back, shows its map, it may show several versions so that you can flick around between them. That may create several instances of the tools that you can choose different things like if you asked for five things.
