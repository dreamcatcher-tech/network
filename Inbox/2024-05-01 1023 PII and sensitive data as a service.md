If we offered a way to store this data in a compliant fashion, and deduplicate it between providers so the cost is reduced, but without disclosing which records overlap, we can save businesses significant costs.

Then apps in our ecosystem that need to handle this sensitive data would use one of these services, and instantly be compliant, as well as having that compliance extend to the hosting and running of the app instance.

If PII was masked and rate limited, so seeing an email address is only allowed at a certain rate per day, nobody can query the whole database, all requests go thru an LLM and are ranked for their reach and suspiciousness.
