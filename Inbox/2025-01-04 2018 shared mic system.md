want the highest possibly quality audio, with max redundancy so that even with connection issues something audible still makes it thru.

Add ability to:
- live transcribe
- signal buttons from partipants, like they are thinking, they can private record, they want to mute for the other side and just record for themselves.

If connection issues occur, switch over to the transcription which is pushed up from the server side and is the full data ?

we want to use auto egress feature in livekit.

coordinating track start time should be in absolute, not relative time, so never matters.
