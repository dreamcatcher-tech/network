want the highest possibly quality audio, with max redundancy so that even with connection issues something audible still makes it thru.

Add ability to:
- live transcribe
- signal buttons from partipants, like they are thinking, they can private record, they want to mute for the other side and just record for themselves.

If connection issues occur, switch over to the transcription which is pushed up from the server side and is the full data ?

we want to use auto egress feature in livekit.

coordinating track start time should be in absolute, not relative time, so never matters.

Need to start auto egress, and to show each participant the tracks for download, plus let them delete them possibly.  Definitely they need to finalize them.

Want noise cancellation with krisp

list files in the bucket.
have a trigger that hooks back to the deployment when the bucket is updated.

Because we don't have active room control, controlling sessions becomes hard.

Provide a little dj widget so can play multiple tracks at once, select, deselect, and have them time synchronized together.  Provide a unified timeline to scrub over.  Show track waveforms.
All tracks being shown should be immediately playable.
