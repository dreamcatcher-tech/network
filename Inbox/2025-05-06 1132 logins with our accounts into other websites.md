If a fully custom website wants to use our login abilities, they would need to go through an OAuth loop. But if a fully custom widget, which means it would run in our platform, wants to use our identity, that's perfectly fine. 

Fully custom website has liberal access to log our users in because we don't know that they might be sniffing the passwords or doing anything like that. They could use the privy ecosystem to log in using us, but we'll see.
