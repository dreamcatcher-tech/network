if we are trying to provision a linux system, then we would have the terminal jacked in to the computer.

we could basically provide a device that was a usb key that plugs in to the server, and connects to your phone via bluetooth, and can use that to get everything it needs.

this can jack in as a terminal, and support stdin stdout, so the ai can fully drive an dprovision the machine, and respond to errors.

it would be prompted to do web research and follow manuals for each thing it did, and to consider what might happen very carefully, to make sure it doens't brick the machine.
prompt it to go find manuals of the machine first, and digest that carefully before proceeding.
Then pull in specs on the cpu and hardware, so it can definitively say it can do what we want before proceeding.

It might be able to, in some cases, reset the machine.

so you really don't even need a screen, you just need this dongle thing.
or even just plug your phone in with a cable, and let the bot do the rest.

can do the same with car modbus.


all goes back as tracing logic to figure out what went wrong.
start streaming back the live logs as soon as we gain access - like a playbook of things to do.

next thing you know, we have a new host in the coco pool.

it could digest every forum post ever and appraise how likely the fault is to be seen by it, and to glean ideas and things for it to use to fix things.
