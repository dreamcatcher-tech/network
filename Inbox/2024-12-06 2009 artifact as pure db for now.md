If we made it just accept reads and writes to data, is that enough for the moment ?

Then from there, we can build out computation that is more than just single thread, and execution that crosses over branches.

Would be really nice to be able to build this with reasoning over the components.

Maybe the reasoning techniques could be applied during technical review sessions with BH so we can actually apply many of the rules of rapid reasoning that we have figured out ?
