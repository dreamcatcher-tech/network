We can do lists as a separate record that stores a link to the full record
The index is a summary of all the records, so that we can show it quickly

Filtering the list should be done graphically, but could be done using AI calls with pagination slowing down the full operation.

We could build up the complete list and use some traditional query tools on it as a csv ?
Code interpreter will only get better for data analysis, so just expose this directly ?
