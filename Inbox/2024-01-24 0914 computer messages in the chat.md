Eg: if we come in from some route, this route should be dropped into the chat as params, and the AI should decide what to do with it.

Should show things like the referrer and other info, and it should be distinguishable from user input, visually.  Probably use the name parameter on the session message.

Then, the AI can respond to the system changes.

Pushing `ctrl+c` should also enter a session message and possibly do something.
