If we split it down into some discrete stages, it would be easier to reason about.

then we can start testing each stage, rather than being sloppy and having each stage be somewhat clobbered by other changes.

so if we made one file per stage, we can keep the work focused.
make a test for each stage file, so it should hold together longer.
