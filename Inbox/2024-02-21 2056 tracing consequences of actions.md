It should be obvious, since serial processing does not allow more than one action to be operating at once, and no requests are allowed to be dangling when the request finishes, so every self originating action to a remote chain is a consequence, and would need to complete before the current action completed.

In this way, we should be able to walk all the other chains, and watch them.

Watching should be a catchup then hover, so that we are always applying the same algo.

Watch the tip commit, then grab the latest repo, and then walk thru the io changes until get the thing you're looking for.

Might be a faster way to do this using commit messages that give us a shortcut based on sequence codes.
