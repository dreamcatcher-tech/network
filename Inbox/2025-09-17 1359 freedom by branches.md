Once the agents run in the cloud, and can push and pull with github, then we can do independent design experiments. in different branches.

rather than choking on a single branch.

we could emulate this by running two folders locally, and see if that is even useful ?

basically have feature branches, and then have the agents figure out how to merge, using intent of both to reconcile, using a specially prompted merge agent, that might use a separate agent to work out the intent of each branch by looking at the commits, and by looking at the agent chat history to determine what the human was trying to achieve.
