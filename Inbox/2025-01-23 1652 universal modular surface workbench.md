So if we could make a sort of a universal editor, just like Bolt.new, but all of our componenty and prompting was modular and open, then people could tweak their own improvements and check it out. So the best option for any given person might actually be different between people on fairly fundamental behaviours. This modularity would allow unlimited customisation and the customisation or modular composition would be guided by an AI that would, in the background, seek to see if you actually needed different strategies, different buttons, different behaviours, and it could talk to you about it. This is a superior model for product development because, first of all, one person can do the work of 20 now. But additionally, we provide a platform that everyone can share and try and do all these different things because more and more people are becoming developer empowered now.
