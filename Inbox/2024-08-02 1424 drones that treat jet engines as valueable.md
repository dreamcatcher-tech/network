So have jet engines, guidance, cameras, but also have drone props for hover.
These attach to a larger, cheap payload of ordinance and fuel.
Together they drive this unit a long way, fast.
But if they are detected or under threat, they jetison the payload, denotate it to give themselves cover, then all retreat.  They could land to temporarily avoid air attacks, or fly using just drone props, or fly back using the jets.

The goal is to preserve the expensive parts of the system.

If a continual ordinance stream could run, like a bus, then weight of ordinance on target would be deciding factor.
If the drones were cheaper than the interception systems, and they cost no lives, then they should win quite quickly as the other side runs out of money.
