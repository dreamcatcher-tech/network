If the main branch, separate of all the calculation, always was synced to the client, then data tools like tables, searches, and other ops can be done entirely locally.

So in the browser, there is always a full copy of the app data, and this can be viewed many different ways.  It can be watched for changes, and walked for changes.  Apps that work on the data directly, without AI, can also be made.

So provide UI tooling to be able to sync any branch fully or otherwise, and then provide lightweight patch updates to the UI.  Some PIDs and glob paths can be heavy synced, and then the changes can be spliced in to the UI.
