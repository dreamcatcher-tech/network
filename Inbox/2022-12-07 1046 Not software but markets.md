The power of software is not in its usage in isolation, but in the ability to coordinate people rapidly and cheaply.

Eg: do not make an accounting package - make a tool that lets people participate in a services marketplace for everything they are purchasing.

Services that handle contentious human issues, like insurance, debt collection, and other types of rule setting are the ones that should pay the programmers of the platform.  Their reputation is scored based on their ethics - to their staff and to their suppliers - so if they are not paying for the software that brings them the customers, then the competitor that does pay this fee should receive more clients.

The devs would always put this scoring system in their software, as it benefits all including them.

There will be no hosting fees assosciated since that load is carried by the clients, or they pay a small fee to a hoster of their choice

Fee payment is a single payment from them, varying based on usage.

Fee payment should be in the same currency as they use for transacting on the platform - they can pay out of their balance.
