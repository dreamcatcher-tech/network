If we can make rapid analytics tools, we can start to model some of these token projects.
Address analysis.
Calculate sale price, funds into creators pocket, tx fees, gas fees.
Show how many holders are now underwater and have had losses.

Then ultimately offer enhanced ways to trade, with rich information attached, and the benefit of these analytics also attached.

Charge for access to the parsing of chain data, since this is a cost incurred.

Can be used to plug into 1inch or other liquidity pools with far richer information, where the algos can be shared too.
