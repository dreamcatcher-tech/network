Can show when we subtract something from them, like if someones desired crystal is purely money, can show what the remnant looks like, and can show how those desires will bend the output, since that is what their decision making will be steering towards.  Consequences of that to all involved, how the crystals of others will look can be calculated, as well as other embodiments like natural resources that are also scored with resultant crystals.  The negative aspects of these impact crystals can be attributed to the actors that caused them, and so we can tune our behaviours to have the outcomes we want, and we can apportion blame on those who have impacted us negatively.

So these models can be aware of human motives and can simulate the consequences, if that is what we want.

They don't invent anything, they just help us see the consequences of our actions, a clarity we have always lacked until now.
