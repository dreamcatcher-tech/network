So to determine the mapping of did's to repo ids, we would use a selector that knows how to take an artifact repo, and get out this info, because it knows the filesystem.

We might be able to specify patterns and schemas to restrict filesystem structures strongly.

This would just be a query in the mango language which must return true for the changed fs to be allowed ?
