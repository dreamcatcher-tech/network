Use DRE models to build an oracle that interacts with an ETH contract to send emails.
Use IPFS as the means of hashing and making accessible the email itself.
Encrypt if you want private email ?  Then store the hash of the encrypted payload.

Also can make an API wrapper around any other service that can be called from an ETH contract.

Once the API library goes live, then we can make api calls from a chain, which naturally can be controlled by a DAO.  ETH can bridge this with making an API model that actions and data can be pushed against.  The general form is IPFS payload for verb, payload, etc.
