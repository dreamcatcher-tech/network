Commonly in the inventors notebook, want to find a previous topic to enter in on.  This should be a backchat view.  It should do some vector searching and other parallel threads, updating its best guess in what it thinks you mean.

Invites you to dump the info as new note anyway, and it tries to find the place to enter that while you are dumping and working on this item.

backchat should be reversible - run it every time to see if we think the command was a backchat thing, but run with the current target in parallel.  If it was backchat, then we roll back the current target as tho it never happened.  So we would refuse to run any side effects until we had backchat back.
