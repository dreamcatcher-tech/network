In this runner, a knowledge base retrieval would occur first, and this would be injected in the prompt.

We would also provide prompt analysis tools so you could see what the full prompt was.
Should be able to ask "what was the last prompt ?" or "show a window that always shows the full prompt".

This would cause the stateboard.json file to be rewritten to show the last prompt for the current branch.  It might do some AI parsing to determine what 'current branch' means before displaying the result, in which case it shows the busy signal and some chat insights if you expand the debugging view and then it changes what it is showing.
