To be able to execute any isolate function with any args, we should be able to insert these functions directly.

Some auto completion would be nice, like helping us with branch discovery, 

Treat branches like paths in the filesystem, so `..` means parent branch, `/` means root branch.

Could this CLI be bundled up into a special help file, that can go round loading up all the functions for all the isolates ?

Starts with a list of isolates, then you select the one you want to call.
Can include reading files, from any branch.
