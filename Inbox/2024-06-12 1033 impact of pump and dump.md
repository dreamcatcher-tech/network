If we make a model that shows the impact to various classes of individual, we can decide whether to act or not, or whether to pass threshold or not.

A simulation that runs multiple agents to simulate the impact of a particular behaviour on an individual agent, then shows it on a swarm of agents, and plots a course to show what happens when multiple agents interact.
