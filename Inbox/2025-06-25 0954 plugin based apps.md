Frames is just one way to surface a foreign application into a broader application.

If a standard inert interface was agreed upon, like a button icon, tooltips, some set of actions on the core document, then the execution is done in containment, and the presentation is inert, making it safe to run.

Basically all speciality fields should be able to have a DOM based model for their workpieces.
