Combine a legal entity and an escrow agent with unified SaaS connections.

So the legal representative is the ultimate controller in case of dispute, but the platform allows for control of saas assets to be done by quorum.

The proposed change is laid out, and discussed, and then the actual change is done by api or by a webdriver piloted by an AI.

The ai is tested on normal accounts, so that we know the screens are the same.

The recording of the action, with blurred sensitive data, is shown so that everyone can watch it happen.

Correcting it can be quorummed too, so if it doesn't work, the group implements the fix, and reruns the webdriver.
