Using artifact, we should be able to set up an agent that gets called during a pull request, that runs thru a set of tests using a variety of models.

For the reasoning repo, these would be:
1. Spelling and formatting
2. Definitions are consistent thruout
3. No opposing changes without reviewer approval

This is what would act as the gatekeeper to ensure that reference material stays high quality.
