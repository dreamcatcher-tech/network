If you use our platform, any time you hit a bug, the bots are swarming to fix it, but it is also being published if you choose to share, so that other people and other bots are aware of it, so that these issues can be automatically ground down and solved in a single shot.

So overnight, an issue that exists strictly for you, that the bots couldn't solve, might just get solved.

You can also put money against it to incent the solution of it.
