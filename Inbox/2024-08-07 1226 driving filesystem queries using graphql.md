Because the model understands graphql natively, if we wrote a graphql translator then we might get strong results from the model, for a large number of basic things.

"how many customers have I got ?" would simply call a count.

Maybe the ERD diagram could be transformed into a graphql schema ?

If we used graphql to drive navigation of the 3 dimensional artifact filesystem, we might get better results ?

Otherwise we tend to need a scope variable set in context or on disk, so we know where we are navigating to.
