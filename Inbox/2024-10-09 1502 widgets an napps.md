If the exports of a napp could also include widgets, that receive the same api ?

Then they can take part in combinations of components, which as a result is a jitter.

This would be part of the exports, and could be in react, or a range of different supported formats.  Hopefully there are translaters between them.

Basically if you can render in an iframe, then we can probably accomodate whatever format people want.
