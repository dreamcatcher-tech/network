So it would be like a bare metal firecracker instance, that runs everything in super light disposable vms.

Some languages, like deno, would have even finer grained virtualization.

The on prem infrastructure is then homogenous.

If we also came with a framework that lets people write their own apps very quickly and plug them in to this secure runtime with high availbility, that seems like a great pitch.

Sell the paltform based on how it could be used internally.

Use the attribution tracking to track internal staff contributions to innovation.  Maybe link that to external innovation as well.
