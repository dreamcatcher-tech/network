How and who can trigger a git pull on the github repo ?
When should these changes be merged in with the sessions ?

Should we always attempt a pull with the master branch, in effect constantly pegging the branch to main every time an action occurs ?

Should this be done automatically, and can be done by anyone ?

Merges with master are a PR, and anyone can create those.

For us now, botmaker can be used to initiate a PR.
