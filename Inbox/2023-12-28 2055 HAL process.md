First we are trying to figure out what the user wants, and then we are trying to do it.  Repeat.

User interactions are always in the thread.
Sysprompts are inserted whenever needed, but are removed when not needed.
Tool calls are removed between runner sessions.
Stuckloop calls are very sparse, so they get left in the goalie thread.
Stuckloop calls are removed from the runner thread.

Appears there are two types of filters - one for stuckloops and one for goalies.

Just drop old messages.  Goalie prompt is always inserted at the start of the thread, since the goalie owns this whole thread.

We might use a chain to pull in the prompt that gets used.
Might use a format to let apps supply their own prompt interactions, with the standard way to make each agent look like it is just interacting with functions.
This can allow us to live edit the prompts, play with them ourselves, but also run some tests on them.  Makes them state, not code.
