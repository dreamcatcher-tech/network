Be able to call up excalidarw in the stateboard and then store this session, as well as share it with other people.

Possibly get the AI to interpret it.  Get the AI to draw on it, like with process diagrams maybe.
Convert to mermaid and see the render side by side in the stateboard so you can compare them, and then chat about the differences until they match.

Focus is a list of files and directories that are currently the subject.

Store the scene as a file in artifact.

Allow shared usage.

Maybe show diffs between diagrams, or at least get the AI to comment ?
Generate images and save them, plus keep an image updated every time a save occurs.
