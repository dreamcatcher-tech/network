Should be able to work thru what the readme looks like, and reason about how it fits in to other pieces, before begining to work.

Changes and bugs and features should be first done by reasoning thru the RFC style readmes.

It is probably a good exercise to ensure that the interface and the readme are complete before any code occurs.

Then we would break the module down in to sub code.

We should start with generating the external interface, or the napp interface.
