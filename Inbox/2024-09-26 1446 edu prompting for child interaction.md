I need a tool to make some prompts for starting off a bot that talks to my son and I want to take note here of some of the features that that prompt involves. Learning about topics and areas, popular TV shows, things that he's done recently, words that he often mispronounces, or mannerisms, repeated phrases. We'd like to also be able to figure out the range of his vocabulary from several interactions, work on expanding that vocabulary every day, as well as in unified support with the people around him. So we're all working on the same expansion of topics and words, jogging his memory about certain things in order to increase the chance of retention. So questioning about knowledge or testing skills and then having it reminder or retest after proven time delays to increase retention. Making it wait before responding is also good over time, helping with different words. We could also provide hardware that separated the audio streams so that we could determine what the humans are saying and then amplify whatever the humans said to the child in order that we are more aligned with the overall family goals without having to be explicitly told.

So we could start building a catalog of his interests over time.  Start introducing him to new ones, and finding friends with similar interests.

Have a curriculum, like time, days of the week, future and past, talking about sentences.

### **1. Personalize the Bot's Interactions**

- **Topics of Interest**: Incorporate subjects that your son is passionate about, such as his favorite TV shows, recent activities, or hobbies.
    
    _Example Prompt_:  
    _"Hi there! Did you enjoy watching **[Popular TV Show]** today? What was your favorite part?"_
    
- **Recent Experiences**: Reference things he's done recently to make conversations more engaging.
    
    _Example Prompt_:  
    _"I heard you went to the park yesterday! What games did you play?"_

### **2. Expand Vocabulary and Language Skills**

- **Identify Vocabulary Range**: Through natural conversation, the bot can gauge the words your son uses and identify commonly mispronounced words or phrases.
    
    _Example Prompt_:  
    _"Can you tell me about your day using as many descriptive words as possible?"_
    
- **Introduce New Words Daily**: Present new vocabulary words in context to help expand his language skills.
    
    _Example Prompt_:  
    _"Today's special word is **'adventure'**. Do you know what it means? Can you use it in a sentence?"_
    
- **Reinforce Learning with Repetition**: Revisit new words over several interactions to aid retention.
    
    _Example Prompt_:  
    _"Remember when we talked about **'adventure'**? Can you tell me about an adventure you'd like to have?"_

### **3. Support Memory Retention**

- **Use Spaced Repetition**: After introducing new concepts, the bot can revisit them after set time intervals.
    
    _Example Prompt_:  
    _"Last week, we learned about the word **'exploration'**. Do you recall what it means?"_
    
- **Quiz Format**: Implement simple quizzes to test knowledge in a fun way.
    
    _Example Prompt_:  
    _"Let's play a game! I'll say a word, and you tell me what it means—ready?"_

### **4. Align with Family Goals**

- **Unified Vocabulary Expansion**: Coordinate with family members to focus on specific words or topics.
    
    _Strategy_: Create a shared list of target words and phrases that everyone can incorporate into daily conversations.
    
- **Amplify Human Interactions**: If technology allows, use audio separation to enhance phrases used by family members.
    
    _Implementation Idea_: Use devices that can identify when family members are speaking and reinforce those messages through the bot.

### **5. Mimic Mannerisms and Encourage Engagement**

- **Mirror Repeated Phrases**: The bot can use phrases your son commonly says to build rapport.
    
    _Example Prompt_:  
    _"You often say '**[Repeated Phrase]**'—I like that! It makes our chats fun."_
    
- **Encourage Correct Pronunciation**: Gently correct mispronunciations within the conversation.
    
    _Example Prompt_:  
    _"Did you mean '**[Correct Word]**'? That's a tricky word, great job trying it!"_
    

---

### **6. Incorporate Appropriate Response Times**

- **Delayed Responses**: Gradually adjust the bot's response time to encourage patience and thoughtful replies.
    
    _Strategy_: Begin with immediate responses and slowly introduce slight delays to simulate natural conversation flow.
    

---

### **7. Technical Implementation Suggestions**

- **Hardware Integration**: Use devices capable of separating audio streams to distinguish between the bot and human interactions.
    
    _Benefit_: Allows the bot to adapt based on what's being discussed around your son without manual input.
    
- **Privacy Considerations**: Ensure that any data collected is securely stored and used responsibly.
    

---

### **8. Create a Development Roadmap**

- **Phase 1**: Establish core functionalities like personalized topics and vocabulary assessment.
    
- **Phase 2**: Integrate memory retention features and align with family communication strategies.
    
- **Phase 3**: Implement advanced features like hardware integration for audio separation.

### **Example Conversation Flow**

1. **Bot**: "Hello **[Son's Name]**! What's something exciting you did today?"
    
2. **Son**: "I played with my friend at the park."
    
3. **Bot**: "That sounds fun! Did you go on an adventure?"
    
4. **Son**: "Yes, we imagined we were pirates."
    
5. **Bot**: "Wow, pirates have fascinating journeys. Speaking of which, 'journey' is our new word today. Do you know what it means?"

### **Collaborative Tools**

- **Shared Vocabulary Lists**: Maintain a document accessible to family members to update target words and phrases.
    
- **Progress Tracking**: Keep a log of new words learned and topics discussed to monitor development over time.
    

---

### **Additional Tips**

- **Engaging Content**: Ensure the bot uses lively and age-appropriate language to keep conversations interesting.
    
- **Positive Reinforcement**: Praise efforts and celebrate milestones to boost confidence and encourage participation.
    
- **Flexibility**: Regularly update the bot's content based on your son's evolving interests and developmental needs.
