I need a tool to make some prompts for starting off a bot that talks to my son and I want to take note here of some of the features that that prompt involves. Learning about topics and areas, popular TV shows, things that he's done recently, words that he often mispronounces, or mannerisms, repeated phrases. We'd like to also be able to figure out the range of his vocabulary from several interactions, work on expanding that vocabulary every day, as well as in unified support with the people around him. So we're all working on the same expansion of topics and words, jogging his memory about certain things in order to increase the chance of retention. So questioning about knowledge or testing skills and then having it reminder or retest after proven time delays to increase retention. Making it wait before responding is also good over time, helping with different words. We could also provide hardware that separated the audio streams so that we could determine what the humans are saying and then amplify whatever the humans said to the child in order that we are more aligned with the overall family goals without having to be explicitly told.
