This should be connected to the agent router.

easiest as pure action functions, rather than mcp fanciness.

the mcp part is done by the agent, to front the commands.

the router switches these between whatever the browser wants to point at.

when the router receives 'navigate' it immediately cuts the signal.

It makes an inbound request that is based on the view that was made, so same url params, just different port/route.
