We should be able to raise what topic we are working on easily, as well as have the machine deduce it from our actions.

Then the tokens that get burned towards it are allocated against that task, as well as your active time.

Our browser extension can track what you're doing, and saves what pages you browse as context.  You can easily turn this off for privacy, but if you're working on something, since the bots take a few minutes, you need to flick between tasks rapidly - this will probably always be the case.

So quick switching between tasks is important.

Pomodoro becomes less important.  Also staying on task with some kind of priority score, where you spend x time on top tasks is important.  Also if you have all your top tasks currently generating tokens, then you can't really keep doing those tasks more, so doing other tasks is relevant now.

See your friends, and see how well they are doing, how many tokens burned, how much switching, how much time the bots were idle, how much time they took before giving the bots the next task, and the efficiency of their work process, measured by successful outcomes as appraised by the bot QAs assisted by humans.
