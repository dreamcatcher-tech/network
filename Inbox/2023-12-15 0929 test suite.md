Must be a jitter so that using HAL you can drive the interface to the tester.

Artifact is coded to be able make a test plan, then run it, then submit the results somewhere shared.

This jitter can be our first way of coding jitters, so really all that is needed is the artifact commands.
We can then figure out how to present the objects using a react component.

The storybook of each covenant should be auto generated in effect, and be run in many different window sizes with all types of artifact status being tested and then automatically appraised.
