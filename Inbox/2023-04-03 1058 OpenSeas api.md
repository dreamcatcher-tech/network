Make a hosted service that receives websocket updates from openseas.

Converts the openseas api into chain events that can be consumed by other chains.

Model NFT collections as chains, and make these models public, so this model gets updated by our web services, and shared, so that anyone wanting to interact uses this same model.
Tolerate multiple parallel views on an item state.
Watch the eth pool to see when transactions are entered, so we know first.
This state is represented by a reporter, and can allow the object to be realtime aware.
Reconcile multiple views, like txpool, openseas, eth blocks.

Get chatgpt to create images based on reading a packet description.  Charge for this service.

Allow purchasing strategies using our service so they are realtime.
Take in work to build strategies for other people.
Allow subdividing NFTs so that multiple people can put in bids on fractionalized NFTs where we manage the fractionalizing.

List our trading products in the openseas marketplace or some other api marketplace, so we can get paid and get commisioned to build extensions.

Merge multiple NFT marketplaces so writing for our target api gives acess to merged views across all popular marketplaces.

Put our work tokens up on polygon or something cheap so that the jira board gets automatically NFT'd and traded, then auto listed on openseas.

Can allow us to attach additional data to a given NFT, eg: land NFTs which can be wrapped with the extra data in our chains.  These NFTs could have some hash data inserted into them which would bond them to our chains, or they could be transferred to a contract that is controlled by our chains.

Eth contract that can interpret signatures from our chains as tho they were multisig wallet signatures in Ethereum.  Can be linked to Eth wallets that have a large staked amount - basically our consensus would require signing by Eth wallets that hold a certain amount and can be slashed if Eth contract is provided with bad behaviour from a validator.
