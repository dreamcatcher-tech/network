Use some derivative of stable diffusion that specializes in rendering UI.
If its goal is always visual stability for the human and some scoring mechanism, then we can get it to decide what the UI is using diffusion, so it can display anything it wants in raw raster.

Can do high quality image renders with buttons anyway, and can model in 3D.

Might be best to do in a terminal, since the characters limit what can be done, and the exact layout can be given each time in raw characters, rather than trying anything fancy over the top.
Can give gpt a simple formula checker that rejigs the output if it doesn't meet the constraints until it is done.
