Use some derivative of stable diffusion that specializes in rendering UI.
If its goal is always visual stability for the human and some scoring mechanism, then we can get it to decide what the UI is using diffusion, so it can display anything it wants in raw raster.

Can do high quality image renders with buttons anyway, and can model in 3D.
