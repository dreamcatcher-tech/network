Dreamcatcher essentially decouples the revenue model from tokenized assets by focusing on infrastructure compatibility and incremental open source contributions. Instead of minting or relying on a project-specific token, revenue is generated via direct incentives—e.g., subscription models, service contracts, or incremental contribution bounties—that can fund development while remaining chain-agnostic. This cuts down on token overhead and aligns stakeholder incentives around continuous improvements without introducing unnecessary token-based friction.

raw: It seems that the Dreamcatcher's mode of ambient attribution for the production of software or infrastructure seems to match. First of all, it requires the infrastructure to be compatible with all the solution deliveries. So we should be surveying the ecosystem to see whether or not the infrastructure we propose could be used to supply many of the ICOs and tokens that we see popping up. But what I meant to finish my sentence before about the Dreamcatcher matching is that all these systems try to make a token so that they can extract revenue from it. But the Dreamcatcher would allow us to have that revenue extraction without the token tangling everything up. So it's a standard form of revenue extraction for the delivery of open source and blockchain style software value where incremental improvements are incentivized and paid for.

“Shareholder distribution shapes governance paths, and governance paths shape the product.”  
In other words, the more top-heavy or concentrated the equity, the more the product’s priorities and evolution will mirror that small group’s interests, communication channels, and decision-making patterns. Conversely, a more even ownership model naturally pushes product decisions to accommodate a broader set of voices and needs.

This is why having the equity structure is crucial to the sustainment of the product, and which motives its evolution will follow.  The motive of pure utility is best for consumer, but profit needs to be there for the producer.
