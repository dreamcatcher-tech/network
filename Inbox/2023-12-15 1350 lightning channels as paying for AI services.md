Trouble with paying in crypto is the tx fees, but lighting style cannels can handle this.
So we might be able to run a gpu chain based on ethereum.

Make a rope of all their outputs which can be used to check them and slash them if something comes out wrong.

Coordinated model training needs a different payment scheme, since it needs to give NFTs for getting the training to a specific epoch.

This could make for a great way to initially get started, harnessing the bittorrent style GPU project, and seed it with our attribution AI model, starting with hardcoded figures, or, a long workbook style AI generated split.  The task for each stage can be NFT'd, and our long term roadmap laid out.

We are missing out on early growth adoption by not having an offering.

Could hybrid offer gpt4 plus these open models by using gateways with the seed parameter to give resilience, and also provide the ssl signature of openai to prove the response.  Makes it easy to run your program against all known models and eval the output.

The programs always seem to have this architecture plus models plus eval type of structure to them.
