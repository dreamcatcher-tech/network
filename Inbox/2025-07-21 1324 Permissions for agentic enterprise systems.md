This should operate a lot like group chat, where once you're in the enterprise, you get to join the private groups. The agents of the system will not speak to you and will not talk to you about private topics unless you're in the org. 

When you're talking to the bot, you should be able to see a flag where it's treating you as trusted and maybe even how trusted. 

What tools you have available and what data you have access to should be part of it. So, which ages can you talk to? Which groups can you join? And what files, what repos can you see? That's what the permissions are about. 

So, who's paying your bills? Who covers all the token brewing?
