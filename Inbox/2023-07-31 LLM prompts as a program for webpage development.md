Provide a framework going from mission vision purpose etc - these high level things are used to generate lower level things, and to guide content generation like blog posts and business plans.

Load it up with instructions, like "here is how to write a vision statement" which can help it ask questions and produce output specific to that type of thing, guiding the user thru correct entry of data.

Treat each item like a numbered thing, and let the prompt select which level and which slot in which level is the current focus.

For each type of thing, have instructions on how to produce each one.

then call functions that publish each slot, thereby updating the website.

Show the levels as mermaid diagrams.
