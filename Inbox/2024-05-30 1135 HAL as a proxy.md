HAL should rewrite input from the user to make it more suitable for the help - like a translator - HAL should also translate the output of the helps to make it more releveant to the user, and include any preferences from the user.

But what to do when a nested help needs some input from the user ?

HAL, being the proxy, may opt to pass the question straight thru to the user, or rewrite it.
The execution would pause, then on the main thread, HAL would ask the question (which may be relayed).  Then the user input would come in, and HAL would either relay it, or rewrite it and send it back to the nested help.

The progression of the help branch would be broken while HAL converses with Dave.
No matter how deep you go, Dave is always chatting on the top thread, never any of the lower ones.

These processes should be able to take place an queue up deeply.

But, do we need this feature now ?
