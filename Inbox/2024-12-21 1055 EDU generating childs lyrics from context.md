If we had a large amount of stored context about the child, all their toys, and all the things that are important to them, then we can generate versions of songs that are rewritten for them.

Humans and zone in on parts of the song, like the hook, and then we even produce a version of the song using voice matching to the original artists.

So we could do covers, that are fully relevant to each person.

AI generates a range of sung options so you could speed edit by just sketching thru the ones you like really fast.

Make a rank heirarchy, and detect when they talk about a new concept or thing.

Lace the topics we want to teach them in with questions about the things they know.
