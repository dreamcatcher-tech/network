by way of gateways, we could present a computer as any kind of mcp server we like.

if you want to dig inside it, then you use the terminal browser, but you could also have some fancier interactions using apis or whatever if you need.

ultimately if you just wanted some intelligence back and some pictures or something, then presenting as an mcp server is simple.
