There should be some tick that fires every so often that checks the progress so far, and gives some updates to the people who might be waiting.

So not reasoning, but actually a summary and an estimate.

It then checks to see if it should update each time, or if it has finished thinking then it goes ahead.

Some things might take a long time to complete, like days, so it would mention that, and then get back. or at least explain why it might need an update.
