In the UI, should show the tool call as well as its api, or the api that got selected, a github link maybe, and the params that were used.
So the api with descriptions is displayed, and the function calls, in something like a datum display.

Optionally let you edit it, and rerun the tool command with some manually altered parameters.

Output should show the file diffs, and the branch commit, so you can open up an explorer of the filesystem at that point.

But what about when that command is the invocation of an agent ?

That should trigger a different kind of UI interaction.
