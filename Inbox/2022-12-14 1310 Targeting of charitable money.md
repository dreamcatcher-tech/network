Get lists of other grants that have been given to charitable purposes, then look up each company looking for signs of faultering: messy cap tables, insignificant founders, zero revenue, outdated website, no demo available.

Then walk the list looking duplication of purpose either fully or for modules, between all the charitable companies.  "Force" cooperation, since if they are truly charitable, they would seek cooperative efficiencies, rather than competitive duplication.
