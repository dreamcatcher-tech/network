We're supplying GitHub with AI built-in in an environment that is running on our own servers. The design is meant to allow others to host it for you to participate in consensus, or you can self-host and still participate equivalently in the network. 

There is also a social aspect to the network which allows for friends and other more nuanced relationships like rings of trust anonymity inner circles steganographic repos that act like the one thing but really they're another once you become a certain level of member. 

The architecture's full implementation is to be running on the battlefield as a serverless dark edge blockchain. That natively coordinates multiple AI resources to share token generation load amongst edge devices.
