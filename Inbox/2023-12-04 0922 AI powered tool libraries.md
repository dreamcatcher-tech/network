With AI interfaces to otherwise confusing programs, such as photorec and testdisk, we can start to make a library of features that are based around goals / jobs-to-be-done instead of individual programs.

So we might want to recover an MP4 file, and so the stuck would be created, where a Stuck is a special kind of the Help - a null help.  A Stuck is an object that represents the absense of suitable help.  It might be defined further relative to other Stucks or other Helps that seem similar.

So we can expand the tooling that HAL can present, and for reasonable and transparent charging.  Instead of asking ChatGPT for advice, you go ask DreamcatcherGPT to actually do the work you want.  If it can't, it will suggest things the same as what GPT4 would do for you, but it will also advertise the need for tooling, which could be completed very quickly, particularly if you pay something.

And, once you pay for something to be built, you can enjoy some of the royalty payments for future usage of it - fix your problem, and earn back from others by their Thanks.

Thanks are the embodiment of grattitude, and at a minimum represent a single bit of information, a +1, but can also have conditions attached, like money or digital assets.

Thanks can be given in advance, to incent something to be present.

It is better to submit your jobs to a fiverr like network that produces something reusable to all, than to get a one of job done, or to pay someone else who will just keep charging and not sharing.

All of us have a bunch of tasks we just want done, we want them for free and instantly, but we will tolerate some small cost to make them happen - commodity tasks.  This basal core demand is what the Dreamcatcher thrives on.  Cheaper than anyone else, higher quality, adaptive and ever improving, with a graceful AI powered interface in front.
