generic github action that uses the upstream url ?

the git isolate can answer questions about git, by providing top level data and a template to interpret with.  Like passing in the config file, so that the bot knows how to answer questions.

Basically if we can use intelligence to define the functions, then our code shouldn't change much at all since we are never having to do presentation layer changes.

But there is a multi step process - first we need to find the help that knows about these types of operations.  Then, there may be some process to follow in the help, like checking a login.
Finally, we want to call the actual isolate functions to perform the task at hand.
Then, because we are in a branch, we need to pull down the latest changes into our branch.

Sure, here are 10 example prompts:

1. "Can you clone the HAL repository from GitHub for me?"
2. "Fetch the HAL repo from GitHub."
3. "Please pull the HAL project from GitHub."
4. "Get the HAL repository from GitHub."
5. "Clone the GitHub repository named HAL."
6. "Download the HAL repo from GitHub."
7. "Retrieve the HAL repo from GitHub."
8. "Pull the HAL repository from GitHub for me."
9. "Could you clone the HAL repo on GitHub?"
10. "Grab the HAL repository from GitHub."
