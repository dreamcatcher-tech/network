part of zero liability companies is we could offer a package where it remains closed to the public, and you can stay anonymous, and control the company.

we will handle the liability for a fee, and our bots make sure you can't do anything bad or of ill repute, and the bots will always work with you to be compliant.

a lot of people would back themselves to operate in this way.
so we would supply agentic c* intelligence that people could buy, but we also sell the liability and responsibility for running these systems.

The effort of running a system just for ourselves is about the same as running it for others, so we might as well do both.
