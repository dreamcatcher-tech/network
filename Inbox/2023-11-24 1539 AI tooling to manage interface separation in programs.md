If we extract out the interfaces into a very simple language, then an AI tool should be able to appraise the suitability of each interface, and consider all the options of any given set of inputs.

This can let it do fuzz testing on the finished item.

But it can also be in charge of checking that the interfaces are nice and compact, and stay that way.

So for Interpulse, ensuring that the methods are well named, well documented, orthogonal - whatever other properties we all agree they should have.

This helps at the architectural level, since it converts code into architecture docs, and then comments on the architecture.   The human is left to change the pieces to fit, but the AI knows what good architecture looks like once the code is transformed into this way of looking at it.

We might be able to generate a state machine network that can be used to prove out the access controls of a collection of systems that are sharing resources.

If a machine is made so that it can only have state machine transitions, then it should be able to make security guarantees about its behaviour, provided the underlying code is not exloited.
