Everything is a repo, so the users data is a repo that runs a certain version of the `.io.json` structure.

If we versioned this file, and then kept a list of upgrades, then we would be able to upgrade the data lazily, in place.

Also we could make multiple installations, and to upgrade they connect to the new one from the old one, and then pull in their data, showing the portability aspects of our system.

Or push out to github, and pull in on the new HAL.
