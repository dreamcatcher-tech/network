seems to get stuck with a lot of requests on pending
all requests seem to have the zero repo.

seems a tonne of requests are all repeats going after the same thing.

frame seems to be reloading very rapidly.

so any calls to genesis branch latest, we should use a single subscriber per server, and just reup the time decay if it has drifted too long.  So within the acceptable window, it just resets the decay amount and takes the cached value.

So this would allow any request that needs to read the latest, as well as watch the latest, would all be centralized per server.  Later we could get the requests replayed.
