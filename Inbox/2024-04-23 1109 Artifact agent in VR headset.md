Make the agent run as a service.
Sync files on the device up to the cloud deployment.
Allow incremental upload of video files as they get created.
Indicate if recording is running successfully, and if there is two way audio working.

Transcribe live.

Basically hook this flow up to any other pipelines that we set up.

Handle automatic publish to youtube, title and comment generation.

Supercuts done by summarizing the points.
Possibly voice clone to read out the summary.

Can use the same logic required for android tablet clients to make this system work.

Might be able to do mic recordings directly, and so in any app, could send commands into HAL ?
