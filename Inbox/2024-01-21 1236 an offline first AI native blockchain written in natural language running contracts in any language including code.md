The blockchain itself is written in natural language since this is just the easiest way to do things now.  It has the most minimal amount of programming code we can manage, so that this code can be audited and change infrequently.

Auditing of the NL is a new field and one we are actively engaged in.
Auditing of the LLMs is part of a shared effort we have with the rest of the world, since this is everyones problem, not just ours.

There must be some versions of NL and some conventions that we need to be able to guarantee program correctness ?

There has to be a framework for it to interface with the computing world and call various functions.

Git provides the persistence layer.

We need normies to use and fund this system, not tech people.
