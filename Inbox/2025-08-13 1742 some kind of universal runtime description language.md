We are always fussing around between sync, async, side effects, and kinds of other properties.

It would be nice to have them in a table or a tree where we can have them labelled and listed as concerns, and have methods of how we solve them in various systems, as well as options for how we might solve thing.

Makes it easier to define what a complete system is, then how to splice in extra features.

Then the bots can help us solve them too.

Makes it easy to define things like dark, and unison, since some of the concerns or features that they have, and some of their architecture is similar.

Makes for a classification system of architectures, and allows for exhaustive mapping and filling in what's missing.
