if we have a webhook system so that consuming agents can subscribe to a git repo, we would expect that state stored in the consensus branch.

we can model and prove out this protocol using direct tests of protocol, possibly even leapfrogging git, so we get the protocol right, then we run it using git and direct in memory connections, then we get it working over http calls or mcp calls.

gives us good troubleshooting if all the message passing is always the same way, like mcp calls or other things.  or a standard webhook interface.
