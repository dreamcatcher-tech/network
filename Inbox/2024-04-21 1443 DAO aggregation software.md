Upstream DAO appears to have folded.

We could fill that gap by allowing all the wallets to be connected, read in all the proposals, and parse by AI what you should vote, based on your core values that you have taught us along the way.

We can do DAO voting ourselves, plus we can mine the discussions people have and be able to indicate likelihood of a proposal passing before it gets submitted.
