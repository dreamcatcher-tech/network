How can I set what the HAL image used is ?

Store in my actor preferences for a specific bot ?
So in the actor repo, there is a flag for what my preferences are for this bot ?
Used for setting shared images, or setting the image itself ?

Is a bot now a free floating repo every time ? or is it a branch ?

Are bots now the only thing in the whole platform ?
If a branch is a bot, and a session is a child bot ?
