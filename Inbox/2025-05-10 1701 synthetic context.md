When we ask the model to do something, it should have the ability to go looking for some context that it thinks is relevant to the question. 

Once it finds it, or while it's in the process of doing this, we should be able to look and see what context it pulled in. 

It's almost like the start of every call is really using the tool that gets used to find what I might be talking about and to drill down into that. 

But also, once we're scoped into something like a particular repo or some particular napp, we should stick there so we're sorted there, and this way we can detect if we want to move somewhere else. The ability to detect we want to move somewhere else should not be up to each individual agent or model, but it should be something that the platform supplies.
