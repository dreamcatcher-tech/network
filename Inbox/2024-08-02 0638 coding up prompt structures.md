Having something like button bot be reactive to the current prompt result, we should be able to control and configure this using NL.

Probably a formatted json file that we edit to change how the prompt processing gets done in a particular scenario.

This would be for a particular agent, or maybe a whole thread.

Backchat would be isolated from these changes since it gets its config from elsewhere.
