many times, an offchain side channel is desirable, like the low latency video stream, or the streaming results of an ai inference call.

so this can be like a side effect leakage channel, where it helps to be aware of some realtime info that doesn't get put on chain.

so this link is available for consumption but is considered disposable, hinty, and cosmetic.
