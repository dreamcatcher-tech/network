Getting caught in the solution can burn time, and our overlap is so small this should not happen.

What should happen is that it gets captured as a stuck and a partial solution.

We shoud be able to replay what someone said one time to get clarification or correction.

So we need a protocol for how to behave that is specifically tailored for bot processing.

We should have clear demarcations between transmission start and finish, and we should be taking the position that what we say is for the bots benefit.

We may cause the bot to only listen to one person at a time until told otherwise ?

It should be that the idea is tabled, clarification is sought where needed, but implementation is forbidden.  Then what should be required is that interested parties go off and reason thru this with o1-pro to get a highly concentrated iteration on the idea.  It should be reconciled in with our current processes, and put on a timeline.

"- **Debate**: Speakers address the Chair (e.g., “Mr. Speaker”) rather than each other directly."
So we should address the commander.

O1 should punish each person who does not follow the protocol, and should punish negative interjects that are not helping lay out the idea.

o1 would then proceed to lay the groundwork of the following phases of debate, since it is probably better at it.  Then the humans vote on what the biggest concerns are, so that o1 can commission a job.

parallel rather than adversarial thinking.  Rapid concurrency, leveraging the bots to grind offline, and simply steering and voting.  Votes are indicative of not meeting agreement, so we need to get off the single system model, and allow votes to be taken.  This is genuine shared governance, since the vote weight is what matters.

Give the commander a vote too.

**Hats & Perspectives**:

1. **White Hat**: Facts/data
2. **Red Hat**: Emotions/intuitions
3. **Black Hat**: Critical judgment
4. **Yellow Hat**: Optimism/positives
5. **Green Hat**: Creativity/alternatives
6. **Blue Hat**: Process control/overview

There is probably a similar system that we can use with an AI as the note taker or reasoner.

The key concept is that we address the bot as commander, so that whatever we are saying can be boosted by talking directly to the commander.

Interuption detection.  We can have multiple side processes that are always running, and can trigger state changes in the commander, like interuption, moderation, swearing, other fouls.

During tabling, can make notes about other ideas, that the commander will ask about later, to get more tabling done.  This side tabling can be done offline.

Set an agenda, so the schedule is set, and the things each person wants out of the session are laid out.

Commander can mute and kick people out of the meeting for not following the rules, and will talk to them personally about this.

We should have a speak freely mode, where the commander grants a pause from formalities.
Speakeasy is triggered when we call it or push a button.  The transcript is still considered, and the state of the commander / the task stack can still change, but the commander knows it isn't attempting to process this.  Speakeasy starts a timer.  After this, the commander looks at the extracted list and the humans choose what to address next.

This will allow for supercuts of the youtube clips to be made.

Seems worth it to make these tools since our efficient communication is critical, if our amplification is increasing.  Loss of efficiency is now quite a severe thing.

How can we measure the efficiency of a meeting ? a score for the wastage and the gains ?   Then how can we compete with others to have the best meetings ?

Idea tabling where clarifying questions were wrong, but raise an interesting point can be noted by the commander and clarified.  So the humans would select from the topics available in the commander.

We can start by having a dashboard of buttons for the commander, rather than a live running bot doing the processing.

How can we get parallel transcribed streams into a single place for processing ?
Store end of utterance as a json object, then watch for commits that trigger these changes.

Reduction phase, where implementation is minimized to get fastest version running.

We need a training process for new people to get inducted to the protocol, but we should have different protocol for sales meetings, where we would train people to perform well in a sales call using a different set of protocols.  Can train them against real time audio bots.

I have an issue where my key topics, like setting a crm target date, drop from importance.  Also to get them there, I should only have to debate the commander, now Smax.

The keywords of the system should be uncommon words, to avoid false triggers, like "endex" to end a particular phase, like solution phase.
