any kind of watching or latest, should be routed thru a single watcher.
If there is a watcher, then latest is already cached.
focus all requests for artifact liveness onto watching the genesis branch
unify all client requests for latest and watchers, by caching latest
move server to unify its watching operations, on genesis, and with one request
dedupicate artifact queries in frames into a central worker
move to a more efficient watching system like nats
