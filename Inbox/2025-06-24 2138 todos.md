>[!question] Targets: 

>[!danger] Depends: 

chat data format on disk
chat query to an llm
transcludes to add context
multiple transclues to add context

unify and cache the data fetching at the point of the target rewriting.
server needs to apply actual trigger based watching instead of polling.
move server to unify its watching operations, on genesis, and with one request

installing napps in a repo, and managing a part of the filesystem using these napps
move frames to render from bloburls
link repos where I can have access to another repo

move to a more efficient watching system like nats
allow pull with a fetch depth of 0, to start with just the current view.

do the build of changes live on platform so we can see the error outputs directly.
