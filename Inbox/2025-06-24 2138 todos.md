refactor and tidy up the napps folder
unify the data fetching at the point of the target rewriting.
server needs to channel all watches thru a single request.
server needs to apply actual trigger based watching instead of polling.
data fetching should be centrally managed and cached.
frames need to generate their own overflow bars for their content.
any kind of watching or latest, should be routed thru a single watcher.
If there is a watcher, then latest is already cached.
focus all requests for artifact liveness onto watching the genesis branch
unify all client requests for latest and watchers, by caching latest
move server to unify its watching operations, on genesis, and with one request
dedupicate artifact queries in frames into a central worker
move to a more efficient watching system like nats


repeat requests for the same data keep hitting the servers.
latest sampling is highly inefficient anyway.

initial load is waiting for the whole repo to download, when it only needs the shallow top.
So if we stream the top down first, that might result in UI speedups ?

frames do not display correctly, as they need to scroll when needed to.
