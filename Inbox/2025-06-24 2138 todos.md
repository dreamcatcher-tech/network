refactor and tidy up the napps folder
unify the data fetching at the point of the target rewriting.
server needs to apply actual trigger based watching instead of polling.
data fetching should be centrally managed and cached.
move server to unify its watching operations, on genesis, and with one request
deduplicate artifact queries in frames into a central worker

installing napps in a repo, and managing a part of the filesystem using these napps
move frames to render from bloburls
link repos where I can have access to another repo

move to a more efficient watching system like nats
allow pull with a fetch depth of 0, to start with just the current view.

repeat requests for the same data keep hitting the servers.
latest sampling is highly inefficient anyway.

initial load is waiting for the whole repo to download, when it only needs the shallow top.
So if we stream the top down first, that might result in UI speedups ?

frames do not display correctly, as they need to scroll when needed to.

do the build of changes live on platform so we can see the error outputs directly.
