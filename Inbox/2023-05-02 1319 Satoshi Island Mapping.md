If we can make a blockchain based map provider, then we can start forming the ground layer for the [[Social Simulator]] and other metaverse based operations.

Set up some dashboards that measure the health of the citizens, and agree on what those metrics should be.  Goal is to keep the citizens happy sustainably.

Make an android app that gathers  data from my phone and uploads it on to the map.

Sell people named addresses on Lataro island so we can process mail for residents.

Citizen level and godview level - each citizen generates data which goes into the overall interface.

The simulator runs on everyones computers so it isn't a central server in any way.

Mapping and modelling things like favours, which are out of reach for the major blockchains.

## Features
Issues about faults on the island, and wishes that citizens have.
Job market for organizing tasks, relating to a when and where.
Funding and payment for requests, like toilet rolls or coffee beans.


## Interaction
Players can talk to each other, and can use the platform to find other people, plan events, show intents, swap inventory.  Requets

## Construction Methods
Modules are built and added however anyone links, and versions of the system can be remixed and packaged based on different config and plugins.  May start out looking like minecraft, where even the shape of the island is up for modification.

The base layer can include many different data sources, and can tolerate conflicts where different people think different things.  The game acts as a viewer of a base distributed data layer.

May include dall-e style image generators to overlay lush looking graphics in places where we simply provide the stick figures to get the basic intent across to the users.  They can tune the viewer to be in any style they like, such as cartoon.  Data overlays should be able to be AI included, so we do not have to program as much.

We need a job board so people can post work they want done in the metaverse, like a cad model, or some landscaping ideas.  They can plan rally points using calendars. [Island Life](https://islandersconsole.com/) looks the most like what we want to look like.
