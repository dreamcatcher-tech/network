seems it has some files attached, which can be across multiple repos.

It has a location, which is external to it.

It always wrapps something.

Then a prepayment wraps this again, and points to it, and can come from anywhere.

stucks have dependencies, and the stuck can have multiple views of it, where it has different connections, based on theorizing how things fit together.

? how to reason about this, and how to generate its formats ?
? What do renders of this format look like ?

we can render maps of them.
the discovery process which 4o should manage and put into tool calls.

"where the stuck is stored is irrelevant, since all that matters is it has a proof attached to its"

cryptographically verifiable data provenance - this is all that matters.

The connections should be a wrapper around its core.

The mergers should be a wrapper around its core.
