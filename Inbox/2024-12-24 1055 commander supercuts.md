If the meeting was structured, the commander can make supercuts, and then narrative can be inserted.  This can provide a more useful briefing to those present.

Also during the meeting, commander modes can be rendered in voice.

We would review the raw complete file to make sure everything was captured, but once trust is established, we should be able to leave that.
