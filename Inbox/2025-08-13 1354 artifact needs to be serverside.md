the server solves the problem of what state means and where it should be stored.

in the client, if it is in chainland, then it will be recovered when the execution repeats.

externally, it is stored on the serverside, and discarded if the server is destroyed.

we can wrap the mcp server to make some friendlier dev ergonomics.

so we need to convert all the tip methods to be tool callable.

We could maybe hide the provider level calls behind this wrapper then ?
