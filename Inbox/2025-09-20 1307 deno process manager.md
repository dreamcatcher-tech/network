if we make a task abstraction, then it can manage whatever processes we want.
but, if we chain these things together, it can give us some status updates.

so it can show us the plan, or the workflow, as it pipes things together.

this seems a lot like the mango language abstraction.

Just a neat way to chain together things, and make plans, like a promise chain.

it would handle the checking if the command exists automatically.

it could do a check on all the tasks that were queued up in the workflow before starting anything.

if it uses directories, it can check their existence all before begining.

tracks the pid's of all, and can close them all down ?

can be set to restart them.

can do port groups and select ports.
