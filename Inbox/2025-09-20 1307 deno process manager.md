if we make a task abstraction, then it can manage whatever processes we want.
but, if we chain these things together, it can give us some status updates.

so it can show us the plan, or the workflow, as it pipes things together.

this seems a lot like the mango language abstraction.

Just a neat way to chain together things, and make plans, like a promise chain.
