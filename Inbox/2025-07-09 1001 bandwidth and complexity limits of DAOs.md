current DAO architecture is limited to:
1. how many decisions are feasible to be made per day
2. how complex each decision can be

The complexity part requires consensus on the breakdown, so it compounds the decision making process, since getting to *what* are we deciding on requires decision making.
If consensus difficulty was X then a complex decision that required 5 break down steps would have difficulty X^5

We can study other systems of governance, and look for examples of contentious decisions, and how each system behaves.  Seems like governments, nobody would freely choose to participate in them, but since we're all stuck somewhere, we have to participate, so that's why we keep going.

We should be able to study existing DAOs and guage their thruoput, their chunk size.

Other properties, like how well they amplify the intelligence of their members, how disputes are resolved.
