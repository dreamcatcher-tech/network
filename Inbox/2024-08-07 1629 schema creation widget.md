We should be able to make a widget with some UI and embedded AI to accomplish any task that a programmer might want to do in a UI, but in a more focused sense.

So making a zod schema would be a widget that had a parser that knew how to do autocomplete for the zod library, and had a bot that was a specialist in the schemas, so you could chat but also edit directly if that was an easier way to express your intentions.

The widget would be searchable from the catalog.
If a multistep process involved a schema and some other stuff, this widget would be presented in the place in the pipeline where it needed to be made or modified.

So for a web server, this widget would be called on whenever we wanted to alter the parameters of the api we are presenting, and it would be a very focused and dedicated task, rather than the blank file problem that faces devs who do not know about a particular subject.

The impact of changing something upstream could be easily seen.

Could also be used to generate a function mapping for our system, with helpful hints, and a test run widget assembled alongside, so that when you save something, it triggers some example invocations to be run, so you can see what the output is like.

Means we can couple these input widgets with display widgets, and link them up in pipelines like mermaid diagrams.
