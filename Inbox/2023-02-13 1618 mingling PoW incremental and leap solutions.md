Mining for a deeper tuned ai algo means we can quickly verify the result, but it is difficult to compute.
When the new submission is delivered, it includes all the transactions it wishes to assert are correct.

But we can also use this mechanism to incentivize a whole new algorithm, if we have a series of dojo tests for the trained model to perform.

Rewards are proportional to the jump in performance that you provide.

The network owes you, in a sense, and so if you supply vastly better performance, it will reward you proportionaly.  The fact that others also made gains keeps everyone honouring the value of the tokens.   Each time new tokens are minted, then valid transactions are processed, and some of these moved tokens goes to the miners.

Can build in the pooling algo direct to the chain, rather than intermediary brokers.

Multiple such useful but hard problems can be grouped together as a shared coin.  Buying it and spending it incentivizes solutions to these problems to occur, whilst providing something useful in return like value exchange with provenance.

Holding it represents an attirubtion target for when the trained algo hits the shops.

Rollups of these coins can easily be done at market rate.  We can algorithmically trade them to produce something stable, if they are fluctuating wildly.  We can opt only for coins with proven revenue streams.

This fits the model of software that needs large training sets run.

Can mint coins for the training sets provided, so if you provide us with your personal data, we will mint these coins back.
