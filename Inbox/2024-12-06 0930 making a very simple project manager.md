Idea is that it solicits funds from people, and then allocates them to different stucks to be solved.

Aim is to save the managerial effort required to achieve a bigger goal which is managing a bunch of smaller tasks.  

Same could be achieved by collecting top level money, bonding it, and using this to invest our own money on the stucks below, where the margin is us being able to do it for cheaper.

Then we can run some simulations on these things operating, to get little jobs done.

Run some simulations that show how it behaves.
