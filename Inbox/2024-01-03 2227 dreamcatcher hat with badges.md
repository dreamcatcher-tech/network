Have a hat, then have badges that show the NFT and the QR code of the items you are current involved in.

The QR code should include the unique stamp of the pin itself, so you can prove it is not a copy of any kind ?
Can bind it to the hat QR code, which has you dreamcatcher identity in it.

Can be NFT scanned as well maybe.

Make it so people can do an auth check, and you can hit a button on your phone to acknowledge.

Can be two way to stop MITM.
