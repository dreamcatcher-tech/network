Should be able to run and test the import logic and the auto data generation logic within storybook itself to get quick feedback on how the code should work, and once working stays there as a test.

CollectionsList could have an import function

## Fake data generation
Run a batch script.
Click a download button to cause the import to run.
Download the file.
Upload the file as part of the import action in the engine.

## Data snapshoting
Jest style snapshots should work for blockchains.
We can push the .car file to some public chain, or just store the chain we expect up to some hosting service.
