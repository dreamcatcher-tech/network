Can do map navigation.
can pass off to native maps app for turn by turn.

Nativescript is much easier to use than a dedicated android app.

Worst case, we can make a nativescript app that does CRM stuff, and a dedicated turn by turn app, like here maps, that can be interacted with and customized for turn by turn.

Might need to customize the directions route, and feed that down to the trucks.
