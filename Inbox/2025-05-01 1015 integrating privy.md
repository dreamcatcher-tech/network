use individual app ids and only allow certain email accounts to sign up.

then the server code is the same and access is managed entirely with privy.

but we need some kind of standard way to intro new users to the hamr login ?

this would be inside the ui, it would act specially, and probably hard code the did of the repo they want to access ?

in the repo, we would add their dids once they become known ? or just anyone with a valid login can join.
