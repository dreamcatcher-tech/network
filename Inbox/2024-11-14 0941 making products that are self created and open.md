So like a car, but where it is fully open sourced, and can be mfg'd in distributed cells, so you can get parts of any kind.

AI tools to easily generate assemblies of components and test the overall thing.

the key to AI is that it can handle close.  So parts that are 'close' to each other, it knows how to relate them.  So we can actually re-use mfg data, to make highly custom pieces, but the AI knows how to test and certify them so they have comparable reliability to mass market parts.

Also the processing of images and audio means that it can receive complex feedback from things working in the field, so it can incorporate those finding into the products.

I don't want to buy a car, I want to buy a platform at varying stages of mfg, that was produced locally.  I then want to make modifications by chatting and theorizing with a bot that was running in the car, so it had all my personal usage data as well as the aggregate.

So like a home battery pack, where we would make a chassis which can have different components inserted into it to produce the finished battery.  The components would be mass produced or scavenged.  As new tech comes in, batteries can be upgraded, and perhaps have a range of different batteries simultaneously.  The app would be open and extensible.

So you can be assured that you have got the best possible price for the battery pack, and you can build it up over time, offering greater flexibility.  Plus the mfg costs went to your local economy, and the response time would have been good, and repairs are readily available.

Then have an electrician come and certify the parts that need certs.

Components will always be cheaper to purchase directly.  
If a chassis is made correctly, assembly will always be easy for any person to do.
Components are also interchangeable, so can be substituted for different reasons, like price, availability, or different performance characteristics.
Components make a system repairable.

Companies are made to maximize their markup, and so if we externalize the company, we can all enjoy lower cost products because there was less assembly in a company model.

Should be able to do the same AI combinations we are seeing with software components - you make a request, then the AI combines things that are tested well, to reduce the amount of new technology that it is combining to meet your request.
