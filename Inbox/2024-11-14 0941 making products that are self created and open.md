So like a car, but where it is fully open sourced, and can be mfg'd in distributed cells, so you can get parts of any kind.

AI tools to easily generate assemblies of components and test the overall thing.

the key to AI is that it can handle close.  So parts that are 'close' to each other, it knows how to relate them.  So we can actually re-use mfg data, to make highly custom pieces, but the AI knows how to test and certify them so they have comparable reliability to mass market parts.

Also the processing of images and audio means that it can receive complex feedback from things working in the field, so it can incorporate those finding into the products.

I don't want to buy a car, I want to buy a platform at varying stages of mfg, that was produced locally.  I then want to make modifications by chatting and theorizing with a bot that was running in the car, so it had all my personal usage data as well as the aggregate.
