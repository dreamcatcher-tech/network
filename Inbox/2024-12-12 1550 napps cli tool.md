Make a tool that can pull in a range of napps and present as a single tool using `commander` subcommands.

```sh
napps concat --output test.text
napps youtube https://youtube.com/asdfwef
napps transcribe audio.mp3
napps pdf incoming.pdf --output incoming.txt
```

Then in this way, the napps interface is used to run napps directly on the filesystem.

So snapshots are unavailable, or, might be hooked into git itself, and then files are the actual filesystem.

Being able to use the napps on the raw fs first, and then lift up to a virtualized fs later seems the key.

Means that we could start calling the AI with these tools and writing the outputs to raw disk right now.

The cli might be able to load new napp modules live, in that it can discover napps and run them in a sandbox, based on what the user wants.
