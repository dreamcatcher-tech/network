Give it a large stack of known good decks, and parse each one to elide what it is that investors want to see.  Then compare each one with the given pitch, and say whats different, and suggest how they might improve.

Helpful comparison with all the decks - can just pick the one with the strongest contrast when doing a direct comparison with all.  The preprocessing distillation makes it more helpful to chat with, but comparing your submission with every deck and surfacing and ranking the differences is the most thorough.
