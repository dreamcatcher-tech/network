The accumulator could be an AI drone, that tool the results of each one and accumulated it somehow ?

Being able to use the filesystem as a way to say how many independent things we want to run is key.

At the start, running over all files would be a null return, as it just gets told to do it.

The loop function could be generalized, as it is a collection of globs, and then an agent drone or isolate that we want to run, with some custom parameters to be passed to it each time.
