If you had a system that could simulate itself in every possible outcome, then every move it makes would be the best one.

In a universe where uncertainty was introduced, to express out every possible uncertainty is to return to certainty.

Designing systems explicitly capable of self-hosting and internal simulation is inherently valuable—not only because it guarantees that your system can reliably abstract and reuse its own components, but also because it promotes architectural clarity, maintainability, and scalability. Even if full self-hosting isn't strictly required, adopting these patterns naturally leads to more modular, robust, and future-proof software.

Moreover, there is a natural inclination toward building complex systems—particularly advanced AI—that can simulate themselves with high fidelity, enabling internal prediction and validation without impacting their core stability. Such self-simulation inherently encourages profound self-awareness and adaptability. By accurately simulating every potential next move, a system can choose actions that are as close to faultless as possible, making it an exceptionally reliable and resilient actor.
