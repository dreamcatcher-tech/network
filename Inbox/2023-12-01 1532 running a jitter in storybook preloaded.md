We should be able to trigger a jitter by providing a wd and calling some action on chain, and the jitter apparatus should pick it up from there.

So the jitter for testing the goalie would be prompted with the ability to call the goalie in turn, and in one of the stories it loads its stories automatically, but in another story it awaits an input.
