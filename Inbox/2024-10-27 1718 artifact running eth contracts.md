If we have repeatable json functions, then we should be able to invoke an eth smart contract too, using this code.

So the hash of the napp gets put on chain, in a registry, and the calls send json to it, and then refer to the napp by hash.

Then, execution swarms kick off that will run the function and possibly the side effects too.

The fact that they CAN actually make repeatable calls is what we are harnessing.
One day we will be populous enough to not need eth, but for now, this gives us a very strong result, AND it is repeatable and independently verifiable by anyone.

So if you pay enough, you can have high numbers of validators run your napp.

Other contracts could call these things to get extra functionality, too.

Plus you can host your own function runners, or mine function invocations.
