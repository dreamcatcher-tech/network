We will supply it with the audio file, and the transcript with timestamps.

Then the widget appears that lets you navigate

It can also be told to go to a certain spot and play it.

Can also slice the audio and output audio snips based on transcript.

Use utterance detection to make sure we slice it precisely ?

use the transform napp to get a suitable format it if dioesn't have one.

Provide versions of a transcript, so some are pure text, and some are high precision timestamped.
