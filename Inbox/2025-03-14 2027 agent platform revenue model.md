We should sell everything at cost, and then any addons you want are just agents.

Want support ? that's an agent.  Want an agent built ? that too is an agent.

List out the three kinds of agents 
- local, open source agents (free except you pay for the credits)
- remote, propreitary agents (people other than us have published agents but won't show how they work on the inside)
- human assisted remote agents (an agent that receives assistance from a pool of humans to solve problems it gets stuck on) - this is the wider dreamcatcher network


Stress the data sovereignty
- all agents are data sovereignty locked
- some agents can be run on prem
- data platform can run hosted or local or anything in between

The data model would be shown as being based on git ? show how forkability means simulation without catastrophe.  Versioning, Forking and merging, with multiple simulated universes.


Meet the agents:
- email agent
- filekeeper
- accountant / spreadsheet guy
- database guy
- code monkey
- IT support
- web researcher
- customer service
- social media manager
- pricing negotiator
- SEO / AIO
- marketplace - hunt down services

Show the agent arena, where different agents fight for top place.
Trial an agent on your data.


People could advertise their internal problems on a local version of dreamcatcher.

agents, apps, and services ?
Services can be costly ?

App would start up the agent visibility environment.
Agents like the negotiator would be used to negotiate the pricing for the platform.  You could pay for your own negotiator agent to argue on your behalf.

We want to enable marketplaces for trade, where our agents represent buyers and sellers, and they trade.

'meet the team' page is actually just a bunch of agents.

Agents includes:
- upgrade agent, to choose when a new release of an agent is due
- reflection agent, to look at the performance of the agent and figure out how it could do better
- stucks agent - identifies shortcomings in the platform and the agents and strives to have them solved

The workbench:
- See the agents private memories
- the custom evals that get built to ensure that you have the most accurate version of any agent
- see all jobs the agent has done
- try out different ageents, or different tweaks, against your real workloads
- see other public places the agent has worked - public data is sold at a discount

### Difference between a napp and an agent
A napp based coding tool could be used by both a human and an agent.  An agent remembers all the instructions it receives from the human, but the coding environment may not.  The agent represents the customization based on the user preferences, whereas the napp represents correct best practice.
