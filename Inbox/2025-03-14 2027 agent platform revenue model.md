We should sell everything at cost, and then any addons you want are just agents.

Want support ? that's an agent.  Want an agent built ? that too is an agent.

List out the three kinds of agents 
- local, open source agents (free except you pay for the credits)
- remote, propreitary agents (people other than us have published agents but won't show how they work on the inside)
- human assisted remote agents (an agent that receives assistance from a pool of humans to solve problems it gets stuck on) - this is the wider dreamcatcher network


Stress the data sovereignty
- all agents are data sovereignty locked
- some agents can be run on prem
- data platform can run hosted or local or anything in between

The data model would be shown as being based on git ? show how forkability means simulation without catastrophe.  Versioning, Forking and merging, with multiple simulated universes.


Meet the agents:
- fairness - given any scenario, determine what a fair split of any pie should be
- email agent
- filekeeper
- accountant / spreadsheet guy
- database guy
- webmaster - runs the website, and can make changes to it, so when you chat with this agent, you can convince it to make changes to the system
- code monkey
- IT support
- web researcher
- customer service
- social media manager - handles turning content into media campaignso
- pricing negotiator
- SEO / AIO
- marketplace - hunt down services
- the debator - will argue any point, endlessly, ranking the best responses, and optionally accepting configurable degrees of decorum
- the auditor - go thru financial records and confirm if things match
- the fact checker - check any facts and provide a probability assessment of occurance
- the actuary - how likely is a certain scenario to happen

Show the agent arena, where different agents fight for top place.
Trial an agent on your data.


People could advertise their internal problems on a local version of dreamcatcher.

agents, apps, and services ?
Services can be costly ?

App would start up the agent visibility environment.
Agents like the negotiator would be used to negotiate the pricing for the platform.  You could pay for your own negotiator agent to argue on your behalf.

We want to enable marketplaces for trade, where our agents represent buyers and sellers, and they trade.

'meet the team' page is actually just a bunch of agents.
Some of these agents can be combined together for more effect, like the debater working with the negotiator can find more avenues.

Agents includes:
- upgrade agent, to choose when a new release of an agent is due
- reflection agent, to look at the performance of the agent and figure out how it could do better
- stucks agent - identifies shortcomings in the platform and the agents and strives to have them solved

The workbench:
- See the agents private memories
- the custom evals that get built to ensure that you have the most accurate version of any agent
- see all jobs the agent has done
- try out different ageents, or different tweaks, against your real workloads
- see other public places the agent has worked - public data is sold at a discount
- set effort limits, price limits
- see where human workstations can be inserted

### FAQs
- how do you charge ?
	- you are charged for the base cost of the AI agents, plus the fairness agents appraisal of how much the value created for you is worth.  You can refuse to pay this extra amount, but at some point you will have to run these agents on your own infrastructure if you won't pay us
- How do I know the fair agent is fair ?
	- you are welcome to argue with it, and you may even task the debater to argue with it in your favour, agentically.  Fair is an open and evolving question.
- I want to speak to a real person
	- no problem, you'll need to talk to our secretary agent about that, and then we'll have a call.  If you do not want to pay for private calls, then the calls are public for all to benefit from.

Doers in this case are those that fix problems, build agents, help agents, work with agents.  Work with agents, for agents, create agents.
Users are the ones that pay for agents to do things for them - employ agents to do your bidding.  Or use the tools the agents use and produce.
Funders cause agents and tools to be created when they do not exist.

? is it true that no human would employ another one directly, and would only interact via agent intermediaries ?
Humans very rarely work for one another directly in this system - they are always amplified in their output and in what they can consume, by agent amplification.
There is a lot of overhead in human collaboration, alot of machine work that is lossy, toilsome - AI makes the interactions pure and efficient, also culturally safe.

Then, beyond the agents, and the separate ecosystems that each one enables, which is a landing page in its own right, which points back to the agent substrate.  So supplier marketplaces are kicked off by the agents that do tasks that cause markets to appear.  These are inter agent trade.

These markets occur when multiple agents are running with multiple independent goals, on behalf of different humans.  Each agent has access to these markets, but also any other existing conventional markets, by way of API or by browser directly.  They can collaborate with each other where advantageous, like to get a group deal by way of combined purchasing power.

Run the agents on your own infrastructure, or on any number of providers.  Relocate them at whim.

Agentic marketplaces - so the agent store would be one such example ?  An agent of yours would help you trade.

Agents, running on private blockchains, can be trusted to act in good faith for all parties.

A friend of ours vs a friend of mine - show how agents can act on your behalf solely, or can broker between you and others, or can broker between your agents and other agents.
### Difference between a napp and an agent
A napp based coding tool could be used by both a human and an agent.  An agent remembers all the instructions it receives from the human, but the coding environment may not.  The agent represents the customization based on the user preferences, whereas the napp represents correct best practice.

### Human workstations
All agents connect to the fabric from a workstation.  Humans should be able to do the same.  Ultimately every human desk can be replaced with an agent, including the desk that configures the system.  Any desk can be browsed manually, and be interacted with in some cases.

### Artifact and napps
These can be separate websites, since they represent projects hosted on the dreamcatcher, but they can be treated as components, and if people want to dig deeper into them, then they can.
