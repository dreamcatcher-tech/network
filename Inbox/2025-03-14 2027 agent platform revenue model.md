We should sell everything at cost, and then any addons you want are just agents.

Want support ? that's an agent.  Want an agent built ? that too is an agent.

List out the three kinds of agents 
- local, open source agents (free except you pay for the credits)
- remote, propreitary agents (people other than us have published agents but won't show how they work on the inside)
- human assisted remote agents (an agent that receives assistance from a pool of humans to solve problems it gets stuck on) - this is the wider dreamcatcher network


Stress the data sovereignty
- all agents are data sovereignty locked
- some agents can be run on prem
- data platform can run hosted or local or anything in between

The data model would be shown as being based on git ? show how forkability means simulation without catastrophe.  Versioning, Forking and merging, with multiple simulated universes.


Meet the agents:
- email agent
- filekeeper
- accountant / spreadsheet guy
- database guy
- code monkey
- IT support
- web researcher
- customer service
- social media manager
- pricing negotiator
- SEO / AIO
- marketplace - hunt down services

Show the agent arena, where different agents fight for top place.
Trial an agent on your data.


People could advertise their internal problems on a local version of dreamcatcher.

agents, apps, and services ?
Services can be costly ?

App would start up the agent visibility environment.
Agents like the negotiator would be used to negotiate the pricing for the platform.  You could pay for your own negotiator agent to argue on your behalf.

We want to enable marketplaces for trade, where our agents represent buyers and sellers, and they trade.

'meet the team' page is actually just a bunch of agents.
