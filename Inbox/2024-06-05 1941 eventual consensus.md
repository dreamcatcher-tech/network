Use Deno to give instant feedback of the apps, then show a longer window that shows when the trusted isolated code will run.

color code and show progress bar counting down as the heavier instances run your branch and check it, until it ultimately becomes certified and distributed.

Test recovery if a dispute occurs with the gh action.

Have a peg system with eth or other chains, so you know it got included in those bigger chains, so no rolling back from there.

Can a secure enclave generate a unique signing key for eth and then provably never share it with the world ?
