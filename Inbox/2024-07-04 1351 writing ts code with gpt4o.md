If we got it to write to a file using a function call, and then it errored out, and looped until completed.

Give it time to think about how to solve the problem it sees, coming up with ideas, and then making changes then testing compilation again.

Could allow scoping by way of symbol or function scopes, rather than full files ?

Might be easiest to get it to write the whole thing out each time ?

Make a plan for a patch that it is going to write, and then have it try update the patch in multiple ways, to guarantee it will get it in a short time, rather than fail and retry.
