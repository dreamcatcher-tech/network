If we are banking on a faceless future, then can the dreamcatcher be one such app ?

Can people converse with the system, then be guided thru the construction of packets ?

Is it better, to have a chat about all the ideas that have been posted before, and ask questions about the performance of the system,

Then make the queries public, so that inferior answers can be extended by solvers who come up with a better LLM to give a better answer.  This would be like providing a solution to a closed packet that was considered better.
