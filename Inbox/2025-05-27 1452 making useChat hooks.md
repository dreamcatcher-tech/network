wrap the ai sdk, and make it natively interact with an artifact structure, plus maybe some helpers to show large amounts of messages nicely ? then add some context to the hooks ?

should be compact, since it just needs the napp schema, and the artifact client.

should be able to handle transcludes easily.  can allow them to be shown.
