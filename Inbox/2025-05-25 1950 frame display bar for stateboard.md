This bar needs to be provided by the platform, to give specific insight as to what is happening on the statebaord.

This should be a property of the root frame, since it determines the focus of the application.

needs a button to show the frame as fullscreen, over the top of the current app, but with an escapable button, then also shows it as a new tab.  ctrl to get a new window.
