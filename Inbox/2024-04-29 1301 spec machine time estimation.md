Once a specification is internally consistent, then it should be able to calculate time estimates for the modules based on previous experience.

Time estimation is such a waste of time, but everyone needs answers.  By focusing on little grains of functionality, we can estimate as well as use historical data in a way that concerned parties accept.  Then we can have live updating forecasts as new information is reconciled in.

Recognize when lifecycle events like code rewrite, major oversight discovered, and other types of typical events.  These are common events, but are often traumatic for those involved since the represent large amounts of change.
