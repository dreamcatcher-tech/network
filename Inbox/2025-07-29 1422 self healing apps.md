if it was all apis, then when there are errors, rather than coding for them, an LLM could get to work attempting to fix, and making decisions on the fly, storing in the state of the record of incidents.

also building the apps, we woule excercise the UI in this tool based manner, using an LLM to fuzz test, and to figure out stories, and to optimizes the stories, as it watches itself navigate around, noting down what it regularly chooses to do.
