because it is reliable, ordered, has logic, and can be controlled by llms, as well as browsed by users, we should be able to manage vast amounts of work using this queue.

the principle is that the data required to track the work should be less than the work itself, so there is a limit as in how fast the repo can take updates to tasks, but that should be so vast, that there is no real job that needs this level.

Because the queue is widely distributable, we can have huge numbers pull from it, and in a federated way, gossip to each other the state of the queue.  Many won't care since they're a fire and forget thing.
