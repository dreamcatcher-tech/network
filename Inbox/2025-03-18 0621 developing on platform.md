The goal is to get off VSCode and run entirely on ephemeral machines sitting in a large Docker cloud. 

Then all the different goals and requirements of the project can be managed hierarchically so that when a change is made at any point, agents click off and make sure they reconcile the new changes with the existing requirements, calling out for help as required.
