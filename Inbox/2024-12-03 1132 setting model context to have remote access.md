If the context was selected so it could log in to a remote server, like the CRM, then this should show up in the chat context settings, and should 

Flag as remote in the drop down list.
Vs having access to remote resources, being a chat that was actually taking place somewhere else.

The UI AI serves as the entry point to the system - a way to navigate, control deeper processes occuring in the background.

from blank, we would select the crm napp, and set it up with remote context ?

? how does the crm installation get set free / independent ?
As a user, I would make it a standalone repo, use that as context for running the crm napp in.
Then I would change the repos permissions to only allow that particular napp.
Finally, that repo would be converted to an org, or given control of to an org to run it.  And org is a special type of user.
I could continue to run it just as myself, and grant others access to its context.
When someone remote is coming in, they can run the napps i provide, or their own napps can communicate with the repo, either using api calls if anyway, or using chat.

This allows the usage of other languages or speaking styles to interface with the system in a compliant way, allowing a presentation layer arrangement.

A napp can be connected to other napps remotely.  Also the UI can be connected up directly to these remote napps ?

## V1
starting from blank, the user would call up the list of remote services / friends / contacts in order to make a connection, hiwhc would be in the configure context from the dropdown for a standalone chat about it, or from the in chat contetx browser in the context panel.



If we had a reasoned UI, then we could get the bots to design narratives for how the system would be used, and to check if these were complete, or provide several alternatives for us to select from.
