A way to browse all the given isolates.

To show this widget, we need to create a virtual filesystem.

The widget should be able to populate the list of all isolates, then for each isolate it should be able to show all the args and descriptions, and then be able to call them manually.

Or a bot could receive all the isolates as a big document, and then answer questions about each one ?
