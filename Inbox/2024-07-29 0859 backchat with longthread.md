Seems there is still a need for backchat ui.

So rules are:

- when passing thru the backchat thread, we always ask the question "does this sound like a call to backchat, taking in to account the previous set of messages that have passed thru."
- if the ai query determines it is summoning backchat, then the message is redirected, and rephrased, to go back into backchat
- backchat is the thread used to start other threads, and it does have several agents available for it to use.
- The checker for backchat can also do the choosing of agents for the thread as well
- if we determine that

? should the backchat thread be with HAL ?
Should it be able to do arbitrarily anything, with the only different being that it always tries to intercept ?
