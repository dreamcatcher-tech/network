So we would tell it what file(s) to target, and it would then work out what the import graph of this file was.

It would then generate the new file, and then it would pull in the context required, then it would run the linter, and possibly run the tests too.

git serves like the working memory of the system.

We should be able to run an agent that hooks into the deploy system, and

We should be able to monitor this machine or any other from the cloud deployment.
