Can use the device flow so people enter in a code, and then we have a token that acts as them ?

Or we use the oauth flow to redirect back to a url that has a small snippet of code that just pokes the code back up to the calling window of the popup.

Seems difficult to use the web flows, even if it saves the user a click, since we can;t use a server right now, and we don't have simultaneous git repo access.

Quickest ever is to get a PAT generated.
Next easiests is to use device authentication.
Then, once we are stable, use an actual redirection site with possibly a server.
Load up the repo, store this special oauth file in it, then close.  Needs the repo to work in a service worker tho.
