Just like we model a smart contract using a statemachine, perhaps the legal system can be modeled in the same way ?  Perhaps there is a combination of actions that can cause an indescrepancy that can be exploited in the same was as smart contracts can be ?

Perhaps the concurrent execution of users can cause the system to get into an indeterminate state ?
