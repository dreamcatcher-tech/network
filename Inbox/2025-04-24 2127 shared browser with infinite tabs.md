Makes account sharing for things much simpler.
Also can handle scraping, or jobbing.

It seems better for teammates to be able to see what everyone else is browsing. The bots can decide if it was something related to the project or not, so it can auto-clean your slate and can only share with multiple projects what's relevant to those projects in any way. 

There is a security and anonymity.

But also an agent can be sitting with you the whole time, fact-checking what you're reading, doing sideline research, answering questions that come up, looking for other people in your network that are looking at the same thing, talking about similar things, finding websites that are relevant, finding snippets that are relevant (which are pre-proud web pages that have been distilled, compacted, possibly summarized by the other AIs on the network) 

It can also store an unlimited number of tabs for you where the tabs are searchable by an AI and are brought to the forefront if it thinks that you're doing something that is of relevance. 

Additionally, the history of what you've been looking at can be seen through snapshots of the DOM and snippets that were taken from DOM snapshots that were then parsed by an LLM for extraction and summarization from a particular perspective or a neutral perspective. 

In this way we build up a decentralized version of the web archive that is also made of atomized snippets of knowledge, some of which have been processed and annotated, all of which have been distilled down to the purity of the knowledge that they represent. 

Multi-tab browsing sessions where the agent has walked many sites for you, and with you can also be recorded and you can jump off them or rejoin them from multiple places. 

Of particular use may be the social aspect of browsing where you and some friends can be taking part in a very large browsing thread where you can each uncover new information relevant to the goal so that you can have a shared experience of uncovering more information together than you could as an individual.   Basically human in the loop deep research.

This HIL service can be sold to others who want to pay for the help.
