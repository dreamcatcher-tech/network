Basically self sovereign data allows an agent to be made that can compare different prices, check your sizing, see what your friends are up to, all because it acts as the trusted broker of your private data, and it responds to other AIs or humans that are asking questions of you.

So a self sovereign data platform that has different pluggable AI models can provide expanded services to your interaction with the global marketplace.

The Agents can also communicate with each other, leave trusted reviews, and can quickly shun bad actors.
