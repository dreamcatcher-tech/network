if a single director acted as a rubber stamper, then we should be able to run a company like this ?

provide services to other companies that we host as project.

do things like control the dns records and other critical things at the behest of an AI rather than having humans have to pick a single expert to hold it, as many of these systems are set up for individuals and not corporations or groups of people.

the ai would have the keys, and in all other cases the escrow agent, who is separate from the company and a member of the bar, would hold this power, and is bound so contractually, with an open contract.
