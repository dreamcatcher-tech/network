Case law has a great body of text.
Models will be made that standardize these, and they will be readily available.
We should slot them straight into dreamcatcher pipelines, so that everything our model says can be included.

We might be able to get rapid fine tuning results form generating synthetic data using bot swarms and rag so that the model can instantly give a result for lower cost.
