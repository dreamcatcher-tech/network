If we have something that kind of fits, then it seems easier to point codex at doing an upgrade to the base library before we start trying to do something ourselves ?

so we might start to see a set of ai published packages, where the functionality aims to strike balance, and it merges in all the code around.

The ai dev guild should pay the humans fairly for the revenue it can extract.
