If we can show the stuck loop working, and then compare how much effort it would have taken to build the software component using conventional labour, we can get an idea of the efficiency labour.

Measure:
- time to first character - how long until someone meaningful started to work on it
- time to last character - how long until a feasible solution was proposed
- time in merge queue - how long until the solution was accepted
- waste ratio - how much work expended that didn't make it in to the final solution
- rework rate - submissions that had to be altered because they were unsuitable
- inflammed token ratio - how many tokens were burned to solve vs tokens in the final solution

Show these in gantt charts and allow chat to combine and filter based on certain criteria.

If we can show that we can manage software work in this sense, then we can create a vehicle that takes in conventional cash.  Each round only applies the cash to a specific set of stucks.  The stucks would be sent out to the inviduals.  We could trade these on their behalf if we think we can do well with them, and if they want to commit at that level.

The funds would be largely tracking funds that copy what some key users are doing and amplify it.  Possibly late, and with some scrutiny, like what would come from a board.

So my crew and I would go round doing whatever we thought was best, and then the board of the pubco would, a little later, decide if they wanted to amplify and by how much.  We can indicate how much amplification we would like by our ratio of spend.

When the work completes, we get paid.  If the board thinks its getting scammed, tell us and we'll change.
