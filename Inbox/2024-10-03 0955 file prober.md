Make a files probe routine where the full attempted path is first passed in and at the first piece of the path where it fails the files contained within that directory are returned to enable the system to continue the probe. 

Once the probe completes we have a guaranteed file path which can then be operated upon. If there were similarities we should check back with the user if that's what they meant for sure and if they say yes then we may choose to record that into a common list of mistypes or misinterpretations.
