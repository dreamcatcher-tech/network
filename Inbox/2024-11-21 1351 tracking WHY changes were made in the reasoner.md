Ultimately when a range of changes land, and are being proposed for change, the reasons why the changes are being made needs to be clear.

Needs a few seed reasons to build on, then an intelligent model should be able to figure out the rest.

It could go thru the predefined rules and see if those rules are found to be in violation, or it should be at least given a bit of a hint, for which it can go prepare a nicely written summary.
