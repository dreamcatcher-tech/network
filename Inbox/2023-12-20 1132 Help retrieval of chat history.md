A help that told HAL how to pull up the previous chat history and answer questions about it would make it start to feel like it knew what was going on.

The chat history should be part of artifact, which is the long term memory and the logic system of the Dreamcatcher.  Everything being an artifact object means HAL can know about what happened in the past.
