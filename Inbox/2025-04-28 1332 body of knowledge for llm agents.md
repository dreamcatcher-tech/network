if questions are periodically detected to be similar such as comparisons of performance of different algorithms or libraries or systems, it would behoove us to make a standard comparator that can execute this code. When an LLM asks the question if it's exactly the same, they can report the certified results. Or they can run it themselves on an environment that may be unique to them and get those results. Or they can modify the code to suit some nearby purpose of theirs, run the code and share the results back to the community.

This provides superior grounding of information.
