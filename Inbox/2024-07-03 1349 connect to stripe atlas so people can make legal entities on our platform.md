Use this same system to file our own tax returns, and manage our own banking services.

If we set up a wise account, then we can use wise as payment processor so people avoid the credit card fees.

Issue cards using stripe so our workers can spend their money directly, and can include cards in our services, where they get permission to go buy things on behalf of others.  This would make us a mini bank, if we take on the liability for the payment, and chase bad debtors.
