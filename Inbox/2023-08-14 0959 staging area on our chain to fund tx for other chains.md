Often when creating packets, the writer doesn't have crypto in their wallet to pay eth chain fees.  In this case we should permit a function where our chain holds the data, and then other people can pledge cash against it, so that as soon as enough is raised, it is minted on the ethereum chain.  This minting should create small nfts to reward people who paid for the gas to make the NFT.
