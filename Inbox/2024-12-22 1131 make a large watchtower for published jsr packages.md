We should check a large number of packages that are directly napp compatible / napp wrappable, so we can auto check if they remain compatible when we run them as apps.

When there is an error, we should be able to patch this using an AI system, to generate a modified patch, or maybe even fix the published code as a PR.

We really want the control of the package removed from humans, and managed by AI.  These AI would then be fundable, and would pay out a profit share of whatever they earned to people who funded them.

Possibly they wouldn't pay out everything since they would want to keep some token ability in reserve, so they could live.
