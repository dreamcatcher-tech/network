each time as I add new ideas, the bot should be commenting alongside with helpful additions, ponderings, then I can ask to pull some parts in.

I would be seeking to page, or complete a unit of knowledge, and avoid long running meanders, so the bot would be suggesting pagination rewrites as I go.

each new thing I add should result in a diff that it would propose to add, and I could comment on that and get it changed.

my sequence of instructions should always be analyzed later to see if there are some rules that it should add to avoid those kinds of corrections next time, as well it might have some clarifying questions to ask me.
