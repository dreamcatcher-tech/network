If a language was made so that all objects were internally always hashed, and the heap was considered universally shared, then we might be able to write things faster.

We can provide a notion of this language on top of the blockchain system, but it would be faster if implemented natively.

Perhaps IPORM can give us a form of this, but using functions inside JS.

We are basically moving all interpulse operations to be language features.
