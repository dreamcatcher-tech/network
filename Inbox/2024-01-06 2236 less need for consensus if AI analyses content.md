In a repo that someone publishes that others consume, when they push changes, the AI can assess the value of them, and so we don't need mechanical consensus, but rather a large number of opinions might be sufficient.

And so a new body / entity emerges, which is the agreement of a collection of AIs that a certain thing is of value, and they will stake their reputation against it, which incents people to run these things and keep them alive.
