Signal conversations are a form of database.

We need to be able to import old chats, and keep up to date with new ones.

Keeping up in realtime is more important than pulling in old ones, so start with a client that can receive your messages as a linked device, and then work on processing imports of old data.

Use the chat backup feature, let people upload it, then we can parse it out, and build up a view.

We might build up a shared view of chats where multiple people agree to collaborate, and then the messages in an imported history just get affirmed by different parties.
