This should not go thru the normal channels.

The running instance should have an encryption key, like an ssl endpoint.

We would then send the secret on the secrets channel, which could be set at any point, using encryption, just like an SSL comms link.

The secret could be treated link and env var, where we are transmitting an env var to the child.
