$3500 for a rugged device is ludicrous. 

If we made the handle be a bluetooth keyboard or NFC paired keyboard, then we can use a standard android phone.

The handle would have a laser scanner, or any other type of scanner.  This handle can be repaired and replaced / upgraded any time.

Can carry extra battery charge ability.

Guns can have a zoom feature for the scanner.

Or use proglove solutions, and use standard phones that are carried nearby for cell connections.
