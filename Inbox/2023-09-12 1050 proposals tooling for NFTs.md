https://proposals.io/ offers tooling to make proposals rapidly.  We should offer similar tooling to help get NFTs built.

This can take deposits, and provide analytics on what people spent time on.  Also should enable discussions about different aspects of the proposal.  Should be collaborative, so that multiple buyers and devs can all cooperate to define a proposal and agree on a price.
