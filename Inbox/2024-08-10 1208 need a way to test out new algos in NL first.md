So specify a workflow, have a bot that can execute it.

So if we have a new way of processing prompts, we can scaffold it out using NL, and run test suites against it, or drop it in to existing suites, and then score its performance, before commiting to build it.

Even appraise an estimated execution time of the overall algo.
Appraise the value add of the algo if it was baked into code, so we would know the gains and costs.

Same is true for an isolate of code.
