You could make a new version, then in the original thread ask everyone to switch over to your new one ?

Editing and reprocessing might be possible if nobody else said anything.

New entries from other people show that they were made with a different view of the history.

Participants can reject your new updated history ?

Or, we just make it so you can edit, but no regen is possible ?

You edit, and then the bot will regen based on your changes.  But the otherall thread remains the same.  IT should be visible what comments were made to an old unedited message, and the users can either edit what they said, or change it in some way.
