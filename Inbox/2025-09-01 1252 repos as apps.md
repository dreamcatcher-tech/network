an artifact repo = one fly app.

it is a single compute controller.

They can be nested, in that one controls another, but from fly's perspective they are flat.

all other repos are just plain git repos, which can indeed be hashed and pegged to the artifact repo, but need not be, as they can just be in github.

The `tree` in artifact then, is live running apps.

is there any point in having multiple forks of a particular line of computation ? like multiple consensus branches ?

The execution provider is what provides agents to the chain, to do independent computation.

The compute pool is just these agent cradles / containers that things can run in.

The more efficient the system, the tighter and smaller these containers.

however there is a relationship where, more power and size gives far greater gains - the power from a full blown linux container, whilst increasing weight maybe 10x gives about 1000x power.  Bigger linux containers don't really add all that much.
