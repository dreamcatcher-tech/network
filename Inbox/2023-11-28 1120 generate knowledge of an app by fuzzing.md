The AI needs to be taught how an app should work.
Making a fuzz tester that helps the AI learn how to do different things, in all possible combinations can be used to generate a body of knowledge that can be reduced down.
We can then ensure that the body of knowledge is sufficient to do all operations in a single shot, and backtest.
At the same time, the fuzz testing can be part of the system testing as well, so it both tests the system, generates the AI usage documentation, and then backtests that documentation.

Coverage aware so that the tester can start to massage deeply into the codebase, and then can provide atomic orthogonal tests that have full coverage.
