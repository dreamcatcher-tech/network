If a repository is set up as an evironment, that means it can host sub repositroies.

It might use a specific branch, or part of a branch as the environment store, where it holds reference to other repos.

A floating repo is a top level repo that cannot host other repos, but sits at the top level ?

Environment repos are creating by the host in response to a user being created.

An org is a dao, which can host repos too.

A dao can operate on its own as a repo, as well has be an environment to host child repos.

Should maybe submodules be added anywhere anyone pleases ?

The top is an externally owned account.
