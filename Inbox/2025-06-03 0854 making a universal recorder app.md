If we made the basic app a server-side napp, then we can provide different types of wrappers around the frames that can let you record in different contexts. A desktop app could be crafted pretty easily, but it would also be connecting up to a web browser app or something that can run on in a quest. This gives us a way to deploy apps that are cross-platform because it treats each platform like simply a browser and it connects up automatically to the whole pipeline of whatever agent arrangements you have in the cloud. Any kind of additional service can be clipped in.
