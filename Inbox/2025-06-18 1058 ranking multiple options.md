Having multiple outputs, with intentional variance, the outputs should be ranked so the human can not waste time with something a bot knows is bad.

so the bots would reach decision points together, and then would choose paths so they intentionally were different.

human should be able to walk the decision tree, and then get involved at each point.

after the various results conclude, we should assess the difference each one made, to describe the strategy each one applied, and use this to break down the decision tree so that the human can navigate.
