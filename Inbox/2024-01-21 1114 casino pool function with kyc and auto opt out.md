If we require a soulbound token to play for money, or play above a certain threshold, then we can allow people to opt out of the game - they can take their soulbound token and instruct the pool never to serve them.

Can allow free play for only the price of gas.

I suspect the pool would be more populate if the kyc service meant you could know you were not providing games to minors, and you were not operating in jurisdictions with people under age.

If the services were legitimate, then this would be the ultimate, as we could get a bunch of operators to get together and use the worldwide service.
