Dreamcatcher is the network built on top of Artifact.  Artifact is the protocol.

Using metamask to sign in to Dreamcatcher is essential.  List your token holdings.  Watch tokens for changes, and do things about it, including watching DAO proposals, explaining those proposals and suggesting actions.

Engage wallets, using AI to check the scamminess of the transaction, sanity check what you're doing, compare with normal amounts and past behaviours.  Can review what the website you are using provided as details with the source code that might be anotated for the AI to understand from trusted sources.

Means that the system could survive a website being taken over.

Dreamcatcher extension would let it interrogate the website and interrogate the transactions before they are passed on to metamask.

Artifact + hosting services + people + AI = Dreamcatcher
