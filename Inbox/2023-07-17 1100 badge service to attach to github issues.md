An NFT task could link to a specific github issue, or npm packet, so we should have a shields service that can generate a small svg shield based on an NFT id.

Should generate an ipfs url, so that there is a fallback in case the server goes down ?  Could link to opensea and use their infrastructure to support the shield and keep it online.
