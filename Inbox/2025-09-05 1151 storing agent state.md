we can just store all the agents and their running state in a single backing git repo.

this can allow us to analyze their performance statically, and use their behaviour for feedback.

it makes the storage layer also record execution, which means we can refine execution and therefore, self improve.

Makes it easy to revive the computer state by way of reviving all the agents within it.

forking agents from a point becomes easy - this could be forking faces tho.
