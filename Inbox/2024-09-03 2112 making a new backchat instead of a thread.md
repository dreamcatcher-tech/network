Maybe, if you're in backchat, backchat should hold the thread you are running.
Then when you make a new thread in backchat, you just make a new backchat branch that comes with a new longthread within it.

Isn't there an advantage to having a thread be separate ?

Difficulty is in having backchat have focus on a thread, but then the thread sometimes creating a new thread.

So the ability of a thread to make a new one should go thru backchat itself.

? does remapping need to add pid target scoping in the function calls ?

Unless the command to make a new thread was intercepted inside backchat, and then backchat created the new thread ?  So the summoner would run first ?

Backchat prompt could listen for the exhaustion of that prompt, and check to see if the newthread command got called at all ?  Then it will follow that thread.

So it is the client that receives an instruction that the longthread wants to make a new thread, and then the client triggers the creation of a new backchat session ?
