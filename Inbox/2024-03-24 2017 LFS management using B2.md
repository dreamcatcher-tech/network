We should be able to use b2 going thru the api gateway to store huge amounts of data in these repos.

It should be available using cloudflare edge, so very rapid anywhere.
It should be the same mechanism that we use to store git objects.

Then we should be able to store huge video libraries of encrypted data with very little cost.

Use deno to control a vpn front that can handle hot traffic.

Means we could store videos and other reference material.

Can make a viable alternative to large files in enterprises using this system.  NL interface gives unprecedented search, and bulk rename operations, plus oversight of changes and guaranteed integrity checks - so no cryptolocker dangers.
