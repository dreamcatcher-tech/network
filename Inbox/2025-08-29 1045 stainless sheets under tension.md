Instead of the difficult forming techniques for stamping the material, instead we use tension to stretch the sheets over rigid frames.  The stretch is done so hard that it should deform the frames.

the shape of the frames is to give the some doming, like a coke can, or like a bubble.

watertightness is from the tension pushing the sheeting against the framing.

this technique could be used for housing as well as cars.
