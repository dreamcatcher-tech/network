If the core of our system is different types of fairness, then we can set up a currency based upon the debts that people owe.

So people can work diligently, and not get exactly what they're worth, but can trust that things will balance out at the end.

then for something like roster scheduling, could allow people to 'earn' credits, where they intentionally do things that build up internal credits.

so they'd have an app, and they can chat with it about getting shifts changed, so it doesn't go thru any single person.
