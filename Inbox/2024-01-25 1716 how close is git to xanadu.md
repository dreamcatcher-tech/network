Perhaps tranclusions can be modelled using git alone ?

[[Xanadu Principles]]

If we said that a 'server' is equal to a repository, then we have hosts, which can run repos.

So on your local machine, you would pull down the repo or synchronize the repo, and then your local computer or some remote cloud resources could be acting as a host. The repo can be moved around globally depending on where it's needed. Wherever the data is read last and is willing to cache it is where the data will be held for next time.

royalty incentives in this scheme encourage caching to some kind of optimal ratio.
