Pierces should be highly constrainded as to how they can enter the system and how they get processed.

Storing them as a separate thing in the io channel is important, and they need to have a flag enabled to let them be used.

So if pierce can only into one branch, and is immediately relayed into a solidrequest, this is a better format.  The ulid is the senders atomicity stamp - we only deal with it when we get it.
