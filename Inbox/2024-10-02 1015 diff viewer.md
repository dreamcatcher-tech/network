Making a diff component for the file viewer. If we set up the stateboard to have diffs of a file that I selected, then the stack would go commit graph, file explorer, diff viewer. The diff should always be to the last selected commit. And so in the commit graph the selection would have a shadow where there would be a latest thing selected and the thing I selected last. Perhaps with hotkeys I could lock onto a particular commit and then see the diffs as I click around the different commits.
