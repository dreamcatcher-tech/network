Reliable execution is related to isolated computing, since without isolatation, it cannot be repeatable.  Without repeatable, it cannot be reliable, since reliable means redudant and widely distributed execution.

Having the execution be in an immutable blockchain structure is crucial to reliability, since the computation can only unfold in a narrow set of ways, and can be verified exactly.
