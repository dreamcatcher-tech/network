like an isolates browser, and agent browser is a virtualized filesystem.
Each agent gets run thru a different type of parser, where it outputs agents.

Agents could be a widget that just displays something that is on the agents path ?

Show each agent with their fully expanded path.

Make same api call type as getting the schema for an isolate.

Isolates could be the same as this too, where it is simply LS isolates.
