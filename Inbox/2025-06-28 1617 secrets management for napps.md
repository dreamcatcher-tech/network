? where should the secrets get pulled from ?

platform wide is blunt.

per user ?

per user of the api gateway ?

could plug in to fly.io secrets management ?

per repo with special access means ? 
we can load them into env at runtime ? but only when certain napps run, and can grant access on a per napp basis.
