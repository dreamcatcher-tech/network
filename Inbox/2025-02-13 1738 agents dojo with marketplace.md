Run agents against each other.
Transparently show improvements in companies, anonymized.

Have a base marketplace, for exit planning or other company ops, where all you data goes.

Then let people provide agents for hire, that cost a certain fee per month or per job, and they can be provided by anybody.

Humans back them up to make sure they stay on the game.

Data management and soverignty.

Agents compete with each other.

Make a platform for the recruitment and scoring of ai agents.

Have a set of interview questions so you know when the machine does the right job.

Record the screens, so that the users train the bots too, where they look at what the bot did and talk to it and review it.  This makes the bot more tuned to them, then our humans look at these corrections and see if we can apply them elsewhere.

The agent can come with human helpers that it can call on when it gets stuck, who can help them go thru the job.

The marketplace needs a standard way to house them all, hold the private data you have with them, trust the execution of them to not treat your data badly.
