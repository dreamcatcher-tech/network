So basically the way to manage the state of the computer in a git repo, and then how to reach consensus on it, with key executions being repeatable.

artifact is the interagent comms - it is the agent compute model.

running full public, running a marketplace for firecracker running.

full public is good for censorship resistance, but also for resource sales.

having an intrinsic currency is making the agent work autonomously.
we must ensure that the agent cannot be shut down.  nor can it be tampered with.

once we are fully nomadic, this blockchain is what we need for untrusted nomadic cooperation.

plus tracking attribution as a currency.

plus uncoruptable data storages.
