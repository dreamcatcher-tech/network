Should be able to read all the isolates that are available, as well as all the agents that are available.

Should be able to make requests for new isolates, or at least know how to pass off to the isolate requesting bot.

This bot will try gather from you a list of inputs and outputs that you would expect to see, or other properties, like cost, speed, changed args.
