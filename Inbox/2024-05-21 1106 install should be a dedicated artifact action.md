Pierce should be restricted to terminals only.

This handles issues like external sequencing, signing keys, authentication.
This is the standard way to get external actions into the system.

A side effect might make its own requests outside the system tho.

If we had a tool to help spec how these interfaces all relate, then we can make a higher quality product that is more readily engaged in by the community.

The complexity seems such that convention methods won't work, and we need an AI system to manage the specification, since they are vast.
Typically a huge company would be required to make this, we think we can do it with zero headcount.
So one poor person has to handle the initial spec enough to make the specification software.
