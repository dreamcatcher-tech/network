Should the isolate code be bundled into the napps format anyway ?

In other words, are isolates included inside the napp format ?

The api that we get given should be the only thing the platform supplies, as opposed to trying to supply some standard functions - it gives only an interface.

Override the files global, and present as OPFS interface ?

? Should the api be moved to being a global that your code expects to have present ?
