Build enough of a system based on intuition and testing to be able to run and operate.
Then build up a TLA+ model of the system behviour, to align with the design and add new features in. 

In the meantime, sort of good enough versions should be all we need, and the under the hood optimizations and scale should not be attempted until we can generate enough practical load to warrant the effort.  Plus we will have the sort of working system to assist us.
