So without a team of experts, we are running swarms of computers on commodity hardware, untrusted.

Some have trusted enclaves, and some are inside a datacentre advertising trust.

But basically this massive compute market should be not requiring any kind of fiddling around to set up - it should be just running a simple client, and now you're part of the swarm.  Can browse or provide, or both.

It is highly resilient, and very scalable.  Writing apps is largely generated, and the generator is usually right first time.
