each individual stuck, if solved using code (or data in the case of model weights) can be used as a block minting function.

so the internal currency is recognition, granted in a central registry.

to pass the specified tests, that is the major block reward.  Then the minor block reward is for incremental improvements. 

A second major can be granted if the underlying mechanism of solution alters in some fundamental way.

This is semver numbering of blocks.

Usage them, pays a gas fee, or a tx fee to the miners, and part of that fee goes to the owners.

you cannot trade contribution, but you can accept other contributions in aid of, which would create contribution for the donor where there previously wasn't any.

We can make little ai powered tests that people have to pass to show they know about the thing they are contributing to.  It is contribution without guaranteed reward.  There is nothing traded, just a marker recognizing the event.
