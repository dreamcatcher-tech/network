We could probably refer to these as napps also, and call them as such.

We could refer to the built in commands on the runtime container too, where the runtime represents a certain baselayer compliance.

Then the ai can have system level access to things, with all the forking guarantees.

Arguments can be expressed as JSON arguments, which allows the CLI to be used by a napp.
