How should this part work ?

Being able to call the tools of a napp is different to calling it as an agent.

tool would be the agent tool of the napp.

If you do not specify a tool in the napp, it is the natural language interface ?
Otherwise you have to specify a tool ?

A napp could spec the agent as the main tool ?
