one smart model may construct a restricted set of tools for a dumber model.

it might also put all the tools into one loaded set, and see how it goes with that, rather than needing it to understand dynamic tool calling ?

can be good for models creating little agents.  needs to be specified in config, so that the mcp that boots comes with these restrictions.

an external endpoint that does not allow dynamic tools can be set up in the same way ?
