Critical to the system is quickly engaging users to indicate what they want done, and in what priority.

I can pay myself in USDC or ETH, so funds are still held.

If we can generate solid comical informative NFTs that are linked to tests that have different run status, and invite the users to make contributions, that is how we get hooked on the system.

If the user can see how the tools we made were made and can ask for new parts of widgets and other things they don't know how to do, then this is addictive power.
