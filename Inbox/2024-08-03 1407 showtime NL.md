Make a simple testbot prompt in artifact to practice running a test spec on an agent.

? load up all of HAL ?

Make a test spec, and a test template file.

Attach files to the nl prompt ?

What would a test spec for the test bot look like ?

Could run it as part of CI on HAL, pulling in code from artifact main, or jsr.io or similar.

Have a format document that describes what the test file rules are.
Then have a bot that knows to load this file up as part of its additional instructions.
First thing it should do is load up the md file to be tested with and analyze its format.

It must surely run on our platform, since this is by far the easiest way to trigger it.

Make an NL upgrader for test files, and be sure to ask the user for any ambiguities.

Given an agent file, how would we find the test files that covered it ?
Surely any agent that got loaded would be considered as covered by a test ?
Then we would look at the prompts that landed in each agent, and try to determine what parts of the prompt influenced its outcome.  We could fuzz this by calling the prompt a lot with a cheap model and see how changing bits change the outcome in this test to be meaningfully different.  May restrict to being per sentence, so we know what impact was ?

CLI
do an install in deno, and somehow keep that up to date ?
run this program, and it will run the test file with an optional prompt you give it.
can run an watch for any filesystem changes.
Easier to make it run on our platform tho.
