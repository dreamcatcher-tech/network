Make a simple testbot prompt in artifact to practice running a test spec on an agent.

? load up all of HAL ?

Make a test spec, and a test template file.

Attach files to the nl prompt ?

What would a test spec for the test bot look like ?

Could run it as part of CI on HAL, pulling in code from artifact main, or jsr.io or similar.

Have a format document that describes what the test file rules are.
Then have a bot that knows to load this file up as part of its additional instructions.
First thing it should do is load up the md file to be tested with

Make an NL upgrader for test files, and be sure to ask the user for any ambiguities.
