Just using a postgres db as a kv store and a heroku instance as a means of making and holding libp2p connections open.  

Sync up copies of the root chains of each device, so we can analyze them using a superHAL type view.  Give each HAL access to view the HAL artifacts of all the others.

Might be able to do permission based systems in this way.
