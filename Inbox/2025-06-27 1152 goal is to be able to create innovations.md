being able to make issues, either automatically or manually, and to automatically curate those issues, is the key to getting moving.  Plus being able to attach context, and be able to repro, and then to pass that repro around as different people poke at it and refine it.

Then we can start to make progress on things, and measure that progress, measure costs.
