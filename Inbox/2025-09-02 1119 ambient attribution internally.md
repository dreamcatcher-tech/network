Inside a small team, where we are open about the work being done, we can use AA to:
1. figure out internal splits between paydays
2. include capital contributions for paydays
3. figure out pricing that we all agree on

any person can argue with the bot.

this gives us a great little contracting company where everyone pulls their weight and gets paid accordingly.
