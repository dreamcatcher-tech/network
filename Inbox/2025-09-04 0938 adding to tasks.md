start task, which would start the codex process, and return back a task id.

extend_task, which would send in an instruction to the running process.
? how to know when this had finished, if we were in codex ?

the issue is that codex might need specialized handling, and each command we want to right might also require specialized handling.

if we ran codex as an mcp server, and we made custom client code to interact with it correctly ?
so the server that is running in stdio mode would connect to the remote agent codex mcp server, and work that thing to get results back that we want ?

but we'd lose the ui there.
