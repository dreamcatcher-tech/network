As one help file calls other ones, breadcrumbs could show where we are in the tree, so with a click, the user can jump back out one level ?

Allows you to be making a bot, then engage with that bot, then jump back out, then jump back in to the existing session.

Select existing branches by clicking on them, if the branch widget was showing on the left, then you can use this to navigate around.

Select a specific node to snip off the branch at this point, fork into a new one.

So you can go to any point, start a new session there.
? should it be optional to pull in the files from master as a resync, or should it be left alone ?

A help file could also have a directory of the same name which includes children of this help file, some of which may be symlinks.  In this way, a help can declare which other helps can be navigated to from within this one. `..` May be included to say you can exit up to the parent in this help file.

When click on a node, the input box will move up to it as tho it was the last thing said, and will make the rest of the session go transparent, so if you hit escape, you will go back to the bottom.

Make the threads widget only pop out when mouse over it, so it is always single threaded with the current thread the human prompt is attached to.
