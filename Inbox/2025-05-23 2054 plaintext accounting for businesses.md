Running this kind of system in a business would mean that people could take a photo on their phone, upload it, it would be automatically transcribed, it would be put in the right account, the rules around it would be known and would be discussed. The payment could be rejected or whatever, and people could even chat to the accounting system ahead of time to check if certain payments were allowed. It would have the current tax code and give you at least some sort of an authoritative answer. 

Plus, it's a way that you can intermingle all your accounts with your customer records fairly easily because it gets sort of blended in as just another file within a customer record. So you could have like a CRM, but it's also intimately tied to the accounting system rather than requiring a separate accounting system. Or have something else that's closed, and then if you want to export it's really just a range of text operations that stitch all the files back together and verify that nothing changed, which should be fairly easy operations to do as checks, and you just keep tweaking until it passes. This highlights the principle of guaranteed tests that you iteratively approach. 

Invoice generation can be trivial to make happen and be as fancy as we like, as well as API feeds and banking reconciliation. 

With Ledger as the data structure at its core, we could bolt on all these intelligent overlays that pull in different kinds of data (regulatory compliance, etc.). Ideally, we'd want to provide a service where we provide these bots but also humans that can stamp and verify the accounts too. The humans would be programmers, efficiently and reliably stamping many many accounts with very little effort. The end price to the user would be significantly less. The time taken would be instant, in fact they're always up to date. They are certified, and we could charge higher margins because the expenses we have are lower. The customers get a higher quality service in less time for less money. And we make more money. 

There's basically nothing that any piece of software can do for accounting that an advanced AI can't do in its head with a little calculator to check its math. 

It's funny that Artifact gives you some core information technology best practices (audit trail, permissions management, change control, history, applications, the whole lot). And then if we couple that with a very simple accounting system and very advanced bots, we straight away have a practically full-featured package that can be tuned and trained using natural language. That we can build modules and widgets for very rapidly, possibly a lot of them made by an AI. 

In the system, the AIs would manage the app store and they would find new apps and better apps that helped achieve your goals. They would keep running records of your goals and they would know what rules you'd set. 

We should also make it so that these accounts can be anonymized and made public so that humans and agents can search for optimizations and ways to save you business money (like tax optimization or other ways of spending). With some agreement where they get 10% of savings, your accounting system can now talk back to you with enhancements that you may wish to make, and people can make money from these optimizations they add. 

We could even do a pod system in this way. The terminals can just be simple code. They can chat with the central accounting system if people want. 

Every green tax table seems important, so we would sell those per jurisdiction based on a marketplace of people offering and securing and being liable for staking against those documents to be properly integrated with our bots. This would allow us to cover many more jurisdictions and be much more nuanced and lively as well. We could share the profit around. 

Ability and contracts naturally click out to the law machine, which would be a simple similar type of construction to the accounting system. 

We need to be liability-bearing to really add value.
