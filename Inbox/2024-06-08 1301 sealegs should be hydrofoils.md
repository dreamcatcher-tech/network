An amphibious boat that can also foil would be quite useful.

Hull can be much more ungainly but more utilitarian, such as being shaped like a box, where the bow is just a simple ramp to ride up over the waves a bit.

Means that for towing or storage, it is making most use of space.
Gyros and jets keep it steady - it is not meant to be dead on the water.  Overnight mooring should be done on land.

Active stabilization means does not need streamlining.  Box means the legs and wheels need not be as ungainly, as it looks more like a car.

Emergency inflatables for if its sinking.

Could be an attachment kit on a waterproof car like cybertruck.

Longer the foil legs, the larger the swell it can cut thru.

Thrusters could lift the craft up to avoid any hull drag being a problem, then it rides on foils asap.
Jets would be in the foils themselves, so they lift up vertically then pivot into forwards motion.
