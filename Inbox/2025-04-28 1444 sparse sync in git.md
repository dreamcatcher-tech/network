If we provide some filter options and ask the syncer to lazy load some parts.

So the transaction history, which is millions of records, would be kept server side, until asked for, when specific objects would be pulled in lazily.

The sync of requested items can be absolute rather than dribbling, as we just get notified when the requested lazy pieces are available now, and we just show them like any other thing ?

can this be part of the mango query language, to filter sets of files ?
