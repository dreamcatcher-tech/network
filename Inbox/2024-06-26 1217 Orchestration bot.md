Make the prompt be configured to pass to an orchestrator.

Versions we like can be sped up by skipping the AI call to figure out the orchestration order in software, avoiding an API call.

Show this in the UI with the orchestrator running, and show how it can be reprogrammed if you want.  Backchat overwrites this.  Backchat is programmed into the piece that routes to the Orchestrator.

Orch comes with the bot, and is just a particular way in which the prompt is digested.
