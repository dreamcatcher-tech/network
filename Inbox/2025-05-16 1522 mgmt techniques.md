if all work is happening thru the repos, then we can measure the output of all agents.

so spend a couple of sessions really driving people hard to set a baseline, then use ai to keep them performing at a similar level, as well as help them figure out how to perform better.  put targets against their performance after they have been reliably benchmarked and pay them with bonuses and pay raises.
