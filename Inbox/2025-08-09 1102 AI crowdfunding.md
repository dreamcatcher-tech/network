even if we cannot offer direct to consumer funding of AI controlled companies, we can in effect become a crowdfunding portal.  If we did this, then we can allow companies to form under our regulatory umbrella for whatever fee we like, which can be very cheap, and then we launch.

We ourselves could be this very platform.

We can raise funds from accredited investors to build out basic components of the platform.

We can set up each component that we need, like escrow agent / bank.
Setting up escrow agent that can handle crypto should start early.

Ultimately if we offer crowdfunding portal at low cost plus we have AI in charge of the projects so they don't tank from being stupid.

We could take in accreddited investment into series ventures where we run the series oversight, which means less SEC reg.

if we set up a pubco to run the crowdfunding platform, that makes us legitimate ?
Then we should that we can run these corps autonomously.

The other way is selling NFT contributions with clearly no profit advertised.  or if the income was derived from a decentralized source.

we could become a broker platform ?

is there a way to make the main company act like a DAO, and people buy in to have membership there. Once in, they can allocate funding to projects that are run by the DAO, where each project has a revenue share token if it works out. The idea is that people buy in to the DAO, and then the DAO allocates the funds, but the people have a proportional vote based on their buy in. Profits never go to each individual but go to the DAO, the DAO distributes them out to the holders, and then people can sell out of the DAO at whim.

It might be that actual regulatory compliance with the SEC, ignoring legal fees, is actually pretty cheap and fast ?
So having a lawmachine platform, with qualified legal opinions might be the absolute fastest thing ?

so we could help do the acreditation process for investors using tooling, so we can get more people on board. or we can do no solicitation at all.

we could also just not solicit at all, and rely on private placements from friends.

? so how can we do this anonymously in crypto ? seems like we always have to have kyc or something going on ?
If we had these shady structures, could then they exert control over some real world structure, like a series LLC ?

Feels like we need a reasoning tool that automatically works thru all these things, takes in all possible ideas, and thoroughly works thru it all to find the most streamlined option.  People can add new ideas, they will be researched, and if they work, they are executed.  Vibe researching.

Could talk about not being able to talk about it.
