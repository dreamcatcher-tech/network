We should be able to make vault apps and have reasonable trust in their security.
We could run these isolates in enclaves only, for added protection, showcasing our properties.

Use webauthn to get strong key storage on devices.

Feature is to let a team of people share a password database, and have versions and updates showing to all.

Lets you send private messages to each other by way of updating a shared state.

Lets you have good password management at a fraction of the cost, using web standards like enclaves to secure the data.
