If we could leverage an AI system that did the filing and policing of collections of knowledge, then we could make a shared database that was hosted on donated resources.

It could charge for queries where the payment was dispersed to all who contributed to that query being possible.

Hosting the db can be split between community members.  Updating it can be any user who pays for AI credits.

Could make a similar version for openstreetmaps.

Wikipedia then would become a curated and staked knowledge database, run with accredited AI to keep the quality high.
