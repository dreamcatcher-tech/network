to down a drone, surely a gun with a 2km range, with a bullet that can guide its flight, should be all that is required ?

Have heavier bullets, and bigger guns, so it is like a lob.

The cheapness is that there is no motor, as this is ground based, possibly catapault based.  Rotary catapault based.  High launch rate.

It guides itself to get close to the incoming, and can glide down for recovery if required.
carries explosive and is sacrificial.  The warhead could be a short range single shot gun.  So it has to get in range for this last 20meter shot to occur.  It is set with detonation settings digitally before it gets fired.  Aiming by maneuvring body.

Eject the smarts before detonation for reuse.  Or shoot the warhead.  Then glide down for recovery.  Hold multiple shots perhaps.  Use shotgun shells, with dragonsbreath incidaries to harm sensors.

small rocket to allow it to tail a larger drone.
