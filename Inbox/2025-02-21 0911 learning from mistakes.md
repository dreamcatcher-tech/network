When a human does a code edit and then carries on, this is a great learning experience.

When we tell the bot, we actually want it to go into its memory somewhere.

It should look at the diffs, and try to distill down this into a simple instruction.  

Then try merge in with other lessons, since a small tweak to an existing  lesson is better than a new lesson.

Store also the context with which the problem was presented, so that we can recognize such things again in the future.

Same thing applies when the bot figures something out too.

This is part of the machines learning signature.  This is the key to AGI.
