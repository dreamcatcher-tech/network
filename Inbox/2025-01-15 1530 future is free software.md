If we give it away for free, and host it at cost plus allow people to host themselves, then what is left is the commerce that the software faciliates thru its network.  If we can make ourselves as part of the network where we let other people demand their fair payment which enforces our payment claim too, since we are a smaller percentage to the claimants, then this is the way forwards.
