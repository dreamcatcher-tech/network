Problem with AI is it generates large chunks of text that I am reluctant to read since it might not have been checked by a human.

I could make my own checker that is an AI which tells me if its worth reading.

Or require the supplier to stake against it, and if I manually read it and find fault then I get the stake back.

I should mark that I partially read it, or fully, so the next person knows its worth reading.
