Make a help that stores some info about what was last shown to the user.
User ask what's new, and gets a detailed list in the changelog.

User can ask questions about changes, and can say what they really want to happen.

Generate the changelog from commit messages, but also from the artifact tracked issues.  So each issue has a far more detailed description that was generated with AI.  Asking about that feature uses this as the knowledge base.
