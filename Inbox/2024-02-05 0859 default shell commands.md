Things like ls, or anything that sounds like a shell command, should be run directly in the terminal.  Maybe we can make some bare functionality so the system could work without AI.

The shell should be overlayed on the goalie, where the stuckloop is a special type of shell command.  These utility functions are the most common functions to be called.
