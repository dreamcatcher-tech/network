we would make one client per chat ?

or, one client for all the chats, and the list of chats is a resource template.

the idea is that the live ones allow us to pull down the stream of transient results coming in.

but as we flick around, we would be showing different static data.

We could subscribe to each subpath ? or subscribe to the root folder, and then update if anything in it changes.

Actively generating chats are in the resource lists and we can pull these down to get intermediary information.
