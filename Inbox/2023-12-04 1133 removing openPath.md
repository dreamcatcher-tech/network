OpenPath may be removed if we adopt a more global type of access control.
The engine may allow a new channel to be opened on the child, if the ACL is acceptable.

This results in an instant opening, regardless of nesting, or on load of the root chain.

Good when forked, since we can instantly gain access to these forked chains and can probably masquerade as any other chain.
