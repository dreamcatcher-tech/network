need to have:
- multiple artifacts being edited.
- historical version pulled up from clicking on chat events
- select any thing we like, including the default messages
- stuck loop criticisms on document generation, or stateboard selections



We need this model inserted upstream, since it might be annoying to do it multiple ways.
Maybe click on the weather icon, and it opens up a map artifact.

Faults:
- scrolling in stateboard mode does not mimick scrolling one back in chat mode
- no scroll to bottom button
