If we see the prompt text come in slightly different to the transcription, then we can determine what words were likely misheard, and add that to the user profile to help the transcription.

We can also run a pass thru gpt4 to see if it makes logical sense, what its saying, in the context of the rest of the convo.

We can add corrective words to org wide tables too.

Detect the spread of new words, where one person starts using the words that another person was using prior.
