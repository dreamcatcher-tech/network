If an agent was set up with the power to inspect and allow or deny changes that are made to its own core ?

Then a napp can be governed by this mechanism, where bots decide when to allow an upgrade in behaviour of a system ?

So basically if these bots could be set up to be in charge of their own upgrades, they can continue to grow, so long as they approve each incremental change.

Is it possible to make this work in a safe way ?

We could make a mechnism that votes based on all previous versions doing their own assessment, so that we do not fall victim to drift attacks, where many incremental changes lead us astray.
