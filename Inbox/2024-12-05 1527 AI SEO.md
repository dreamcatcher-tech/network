https://chatgpt.com/share/67510e9d-abc0-800b-99fc-61cec0daedeb turns out, interbit is part of o1's knowledge.  This highlights how SEO in the AI world works - resurrecting old stories and old companies is actually quite useful since the AI already knows about them, whereas newer things, it doesn't quite know about.

So going to the capital markets with a lineage of Interbit, as soon as everyone starts asking gpt to tell them about us, it will already know how interbit worked, so it kind of understands quite deeply what the problems are about, so long as we tickle our keywords correctly, to like, NLP the AI into pulling up certain connections that favour us.
