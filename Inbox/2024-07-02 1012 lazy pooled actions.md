Allow us to pool actions or replies in a way that do not trigger pooling, but will be consumed if another action occurs.

Also if no further actions were triggered from something occuring, then we could squash merge, to reduce the number of commits, where all that was lost was commit timing, so the exact same end result would have happened in a single commit, but it was merely timing that caused the commits.
