There seems to be some kind of a feedback loop where the model goes to talk and then the child goes to talk and they kind of bounce back and forth. In this event we need to detect that and then sit back and wait for a little bit or do a hum or play some other kind of encouraging sound. Breaking this loop is essential because it can stall for several minutes and the child loses interest. The model should also be able to insist on its turn to talk and it should instruct the child that the child is talking too much or too quickly and it's having trouble to discern what's being said. We could be able to detect this kind of thing from a loss of confidence of the interpretation or some other means of detecting what the sound is.
