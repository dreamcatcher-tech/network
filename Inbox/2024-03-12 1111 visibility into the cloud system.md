Being able to see locks, and other stats, live, seems very useful.

Watching the response to an action.

Watching the filesystem changes live.

Pull down commits, using splices, to interogate what is happening inside the io.json file at each point.  Then we can repeat the execution to determine if things ran correctly.  This harnesses our repeatability tooling as early as possible to make things easier to debug.

So, as long as the cloud can share the git repo, we can pull it down and sync it.
