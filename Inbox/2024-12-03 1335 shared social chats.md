Be able to share sessions with each other, with friends, and then start chatting there.
Access chats that you have, so can pull them in to context and share them, like a portal.

Include your private chats in the shared context.
Updating context shows as a chat event.
Chat events are tagged with a version.
Clicking on the chat event will show the version of the context with a quick button to get you to the latest and show clearly that you are viewing history.
