There might be very little to gain from having chats at all. The only distinction is whether they are private/trusted with your fully controlled agents or if they are public/with some external agents. If we make widgets that distinguish between those and then highlight appropriately, we can have chats with external agents, no problem. They should be limited in what the context can be added to for them. 

internal would mean they are with agents that I fully control, or that are installed as napps on this repo, rather than external agents, which are at the same level as I am.
