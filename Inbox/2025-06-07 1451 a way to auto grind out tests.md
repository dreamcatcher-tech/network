Each little correct feels like it goes nowhere - the fix is made, some unit tests put down, but the machine never learns from what I want.  It's as tho the spec never gets extended each time we make changes.

If only there was a way to have the machine loop more trying to figure this out.

This comes down to needing our own agentic platform.

When does the game editor become the game world ?
When does the dev platform become the app ?
Where else are their distinct worlds like this, that we might blur them ?

its like how crypto trading became a game in itself, and meme coins came as the game element pushing back up against the trading element.
