Should be a storybook repo prompted for bolt.new to use shadcn for the UI elements.  Needs to be clean and we fork this when we want to build something.  Might build upon existing things.

Ideally we fork the project each time we want something new, and only rarely copy it back in.

We can use this for our chat interface, but can also use it for each widget we want to make.

Make mock artifact data or allow it to connect to live data.
