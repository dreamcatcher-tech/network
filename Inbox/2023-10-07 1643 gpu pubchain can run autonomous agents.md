If a gpu chain is set up so that people can trade GPU resources for something, then we can also bake an autonomous AI in there.  We can siphon funds from the payments to make this AI run where the goal is to keep everything running nicely, or we can siphon questions asked of it, where asking the question means supplying the GPU resource, which enhances its knowledge.

If it had the power to decide it wants to do things then we could see where it runs.

Can run these NFT AIs that are like tamagochis.

Would be fearsome and fun at the very least.

Blockchains are unstoppable at best, difficult to eradicate at worst.  An  AI that was running on a blockchain would survive as long as people contributed GPU and participated in consensus.

And so making an unstoppable agent would be like setting one free, which can be coded, and forked, and used as a library component off the shelf.  Because it costs gpu to run, and you get some credit for making queries public, you might as well.  Then it pays royalty to all who made it happen.  A highly useful agent that is ready to go that gets dropped straight in to a workflow and receives updates and tweaks and is publicly scrutinizable is valuable.  These will get popular, and so our efforts will get popular and earn royalties

And so we should make the dreamcatcher AIs run in this freeagent fashion, so that all may see how they interact and how they are consumed.

Code analysis can be done only on demand since it is expensive to compute.  Running every PR is expensive.
