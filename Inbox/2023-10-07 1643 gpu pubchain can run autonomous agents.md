If a gpu chain is set up so that people can trade GPU resources for something, then we can also bake an autonomous AI in there.  We can siphon funds from the payments to make this AI run where the goal is to keep everything running nicely, or we can siphon questions asked of it, where asking the question means supplying the GPU resource, which enhances its knowledge.

If it had the power to decide it wants to do things then we could see where it runs.

Can run these NFT AIs that are like tamagochis.

Would be fearsome and fun at the very least.

Blockchains are unstoppable at best, difficult to eradicate at worst.  An  AI that was running on a blockchain would survive as long as people contributed GPU and participated in consensus.
