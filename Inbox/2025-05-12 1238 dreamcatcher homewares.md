If the process of making very minor home improvements was spread between a range of willing people, then we can harness the interests that all of them have and build these novel little products that can ultimately become further income for them, but at the very least make their lives better and a few others better.

Just having the platform to push the problems out and manufacturing/sell to a receive iterations or patches or improvements that the intellect has concocted - this is the key to the stucks loop in any given endeavor, and so endeavors around the home are the same.

We need video cameras/a way to express the problems/pass feedback. Some of that can be automated with them machines themselves have some intellect or a video feed that watches the thing and action is brought process by an AI to get their feedback for product development cycle. Then new improvements are suggested, some are implemented, tested using FEA analysis, and finally moved on to prototyping and used by some people. The final version is released for general consumption, and then automated upgrades or people being made aware of it and choosing to pay for the upgrades are done.

Manufacturing cells with 3D printers to little workshops to whatever in between can very rapidly at a low and reasonable price supporting the local economy immune of tariffs can manufacture them with very cheap shipping and low turnaround time.
