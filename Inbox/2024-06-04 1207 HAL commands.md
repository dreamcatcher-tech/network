Start a new session with a given help file as the default.
This would make a forked session, then write the new help file.
Could also modify any help files accordingly as a trial.

? How to make load based testing work, with multiple forks ?

How to present ? as a table probably, or just plain text interpretations of ls.

If the help is invoked as a daemon, switch the UI to it.  If as a drone, then it is a tool call.  If a help with the discussion flag set high, then we switch the UI to it.

We can navigate back to the main thread, if it is running as a task we can cancel, if an agent then it can be navigated to and interacted with easily using drill down and back buttons.
