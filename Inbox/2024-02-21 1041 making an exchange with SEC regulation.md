If we copied what fairmint is doing, and acquired someone with a license to manage equities, then we could present an equity management system that was regulated under the SEC and could have our AI agents giving advice on investments and enacting trades.

Fairmint is doing it badly in that they are not transparent or forthcoming as to how their systems work.  They have plans and aspirations, but their execution is going to be complicated.

If we could integrate with company registries, then we can enable transfers with compliance.
