If we copied what fairmint is doing, and acquired someone with a license to manage equities, then we could present an equity management system that was regulated under the SEC and could have our AI agents giving advice on investments and enacting trades.

Fairmint is doing it badly in that they are not transparent or forthcoming as to how their systems work.  They have plans and aspirations, but their execution is going to be complicated.

If we could integrate with company registries, then we can enable transfers with compliance.

Why should doing a listing for one company be much harder than doing it for all companies ?  Like surely, since the regulation for the SEC is open ended, we could become an an agent, or pay an agent to take on some of the duties we need, and charge for the process using our systems ?

If AI is the admin destroyer, then compliance hurdles are the main place they should apply.

Then we should be able to map out all the path ways thru different compliance requirements, and keep having that added to as we progress.  Each chat and discussion, each piece of legal advice, should grow this intelligence.
