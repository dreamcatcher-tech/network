As new versions get created, we need to be able to force a migration between contracts.
This would  break all the operator approvals.

We could move the approvals to be a separate contract, which stays stable, and moves funds into whatever the most recent contract is.

Might be easiest just to let the old version die, and require manual movement ?.
