If an audio processing system was created using open source software, then because it's very sensitive to tuning and hardware setup, you can tie the billing to the hardware. The pain required to set up and make your own hardware is prohibitive. 

Even the manufacturer of the hardware could be open-sourced, perhaps, but then you would have lost complete control of it, but you may get some fixes back. 

It still comes down to having the Dreamcatcher based system doing all the AI processing and attributing to the effort required to design the hardware, the specific hardware that was being used. The attribution of the hardware should take into account not only the value of it at present but also the viable alternative to do the same thing. So if a cheaper alternative appears, then the more expensive hardware would get less anyway simply by there being other options that could have been used.
