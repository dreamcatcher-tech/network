If we make a global wishlist, then we can let people have their own personal wishlist.

If we have a tool that helps them refine their requirement, and provides some good examples of the use case, and helps them focus in on it, then maybe generates an image for them, and at least generates an NFT image for it.

Plus if we can estimate the worth of the idea and let other people come in an evaluate it, then have some people put some money against it, that should be quite thrilling.

Plus if they could mint the NFT to represent the task, and they can be assured it is a good distance away conceptually from any other thing, this is a good little task.

If we can get people to collaborate on things, this is the core of the whole endeavour.  And if they can collaborate with legal backup, where money changed hands, that is even better.
