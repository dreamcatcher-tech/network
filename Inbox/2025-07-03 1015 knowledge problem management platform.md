If a regular software company, that we outsourcing its work to contractors, required that all contractors use our platform to store problems, reason about issues, then it is simple to have an ai attempt to solve them, but also to have the wider network tackle those problems.

We could insert an agent that assesses the proprietary nature of the problem, and scores it based on how general the problem is, vs how critical to a competitor it is.

the contractor companies that defaulted to using this platform would have stronger offerings.  Clear communications would be occurring always between the operators.

So you can use our platform to find full time staff, or people that can just work your problem and get paid for the hours, but they use our platform to receive work, communicate with you, and our ai agents ease the burden of comms, of QA, and of discipline.
