we should expose a notes tool that tracks the little bits of distilled knowledge the bot gathers as it works with you on the problem.

it would be background reconciling and improving each one, constantly checking it.

the history of the notepad is available, so it can store reasons why it changed things, just using git commits.

you can see what it thinks your intent is and you can correct it or clarify - this is helpful as it helps the user steer.
