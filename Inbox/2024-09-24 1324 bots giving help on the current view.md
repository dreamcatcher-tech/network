I wonder if we could be able to generate documentation from getting the bots to parse the actual source code of the interface, or at least some of the storyboard stories, or to take a screenshot of what the user is seeing using Canvas and interpret that completely.

Also if we took a complete screenshot, then gave it knowledge of how the system is supposed to be used, and the help files, then it should be able to provide advice.

Screenshot is just a tool call
