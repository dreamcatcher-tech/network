repos give transclusions a base anchoring, since they are a free floating thing, so a repo is the place they are anchored.

how to have transclusions that are signed by multiple repos ? is it signed as soon as all three repos have committed with a version that aligns between them all ?  then the viewer is the one that compares all the pieces to determine if consensus was met ?
