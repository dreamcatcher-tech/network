I should be able to type statements, slowly, and long ones, and then in the background agents kick off to try and enact the change that Imight be talking about.

Trying to auto complete what I'm saying is trivial, but doing actions in the system is next level.

Also looking at what I wrote above and proposing tidy ups, compactions, and other edits.

Having it ask questions, add suggestions, pull up relevant topics from my banks or from the web.
