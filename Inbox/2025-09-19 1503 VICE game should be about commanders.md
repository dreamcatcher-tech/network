commanders issue instructions to fleets of agents, and so your goal is to control your agents, or talk to other players directly, like giving agents commands to carry out, and you fight against an AI warlord who has taken control of the underworld.

you have to fight with them for ecnonomy, turf, and all kinds of things.

then once a human takes the throne, the ai's will fight to dethrone them, and other humans will fight to dethrone them.

the long running game never resents, but other game timelines resent.
