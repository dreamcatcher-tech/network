Chat about book recommendations then use a scraper like libgen to pull the book in and digest it.

Extract out portions of relevance, like summarize, generate more examples or simple examples, answer some questions about the book.

Make an autonomous AI that can receive uploads of books from anywhere, and will classify them and determine if they are authentic uploads, then will also generate a vector store so the agent can use the information as RAG.

Let you download the full library and store several terabytes of it, in a chattable way.  Then let you change formats for different devices, but also let you stay up to date with changes in the library.

Handle royalty payments to the uploaders and the authors.
