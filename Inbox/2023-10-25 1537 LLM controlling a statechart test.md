If we give the LLM a statechart and a dashboard, then it should be able to navigate to a given state.

So we might say "give me 5 packets that are funded", then it should be able to loop around until it got the system into that state - it would act like an intelligent fuzzer.

Each time it would be checking if it was closer to its goal, or the same.

Might be able to look up macros that it learned to save, like 'make a packet' and 'make a packet with funding'.

Could run a simulation where it acts as different users, doing different things, like writing solutions to packets, acting as QA, and acting as a funder.
