If each frame was allowed to declare its title and some description ?

or, the ai that calls on the frame should set the title and the description ?
so it gets set in the holder, as to the title of the window ?

frame should be able to post a status or some description ?
show when its busy, and report some progress, possibly by just exposing the artifact task tree, so that a relatively detailed process tree can be exposed ?

why should debug be any different to normal execution, if we store the checkpoints carefully, like key function calls ?  this means them replayable and rewindable.
