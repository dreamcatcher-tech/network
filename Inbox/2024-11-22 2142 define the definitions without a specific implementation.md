So we probably want to have a separate folder that has all the implementation specifics and the reasoning about each of those in it ?

Link back these things to the definitions.  Show on a graph what parts of the implementation rely on what parts of the definitions.

Then bring in the blog posts and other items.

Blogs should never have any new information, but just assemble in a consumable way what is included in definitions and implementations.  This should make them chattable, and the sys prompt that caused the tone and presentation of the blog should be present in the bot.
