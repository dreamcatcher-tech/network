Expansion of autonomous automated markets, starting with IT services.

Rules to stop the ills of IT services, whilst preserving personal relationships between participants.

Increase the connectivioty of automated trade.

Make a generic softwareizer of all things for a company to use, where it inducts any service and for a fee, interacts with them in a standard way, reducing the burden of manual handling.

Turn support into an insurance exercise.  Adjust the premiums up and down based on specific costs.

Ideally want to run an entire site on chromebooks and phones.  In replacing legacy software, we generate income from that software resale, and enable broader acquisition capabilities.

Move towards infrastructure as code, and therefore IT services work as independent isolated remote workable "code commits".

Not a company, but a network - a network of computer networkers.  It is astounding the those who build and maintain computer networks do not themselves have a strong network operating model.

Spread the cost of making good decisions around, then all benefit from shared knowledge commons about what best practices and best units are.  Being able to compare all the different desktop options between all installers and their lessons learned is much better.  Provides an undebateable reference.

We're always going to have to deal with IT companies, so if we can have a smooth way to integrate or replace them, great.  IT services are too expensive currently, so offering an alternative is a good way to get started on the model.

Use remote workers at cheaper rates to do the same skilled work.  With good procedures and security, damage from rogue workers will be minimal.

If android for mobile and chromebooks, then we can be developing for the same platform all the time.  Might need reactnative or similar to handle running JS libraries at first.

Maintaining custom written apps has a high overhead, and so this company allows that to function.

Start the pipeline of work back to Ukraine where remote admin work occurs.
Design the operation so that the remote support can't do any real damage, since they can only access machines while staff are watching, and can only change whatever the staff can change, so should not be able to change anything, or ransom anything.
Map these trust networks so we can be sure we have good people that are trustworthy.

Start with accounting and publishing of the costs of the support.

Operate an enterprise on hardware that can be purchased locally, and always know how much hardware we can lay our hands on, particularly in disaster scenarios.
Set up datacentres at the company, and rent out space there to other users.

Prep companies to rapidly go remote or offline during natural disasters.

Provides a strong pipeline of custom app work, each of which can be resold, provides a base of customers that can share apps, displaces difficult IT companies that block new apps, provide support for custom apps.

Automated trade between companies for services and products.  Starting with IT services.  We operate in our own marketplace.

## Construction
Use the Dreamcatcher to get construction done for the OpenIT software platform.
Requests for modules like laptop templates, remote management systems.
API'd people as IT service people are the best way to get app ideas into the system.
All the money for the service contracts flows thru the gateway company.
Purchases of new equipment go thru gateway - makes it easier to fund hardware for customers if we know they have already paid.
Live monitoring tooling that feeds back to OpenIT so that any operatives can get in and work on the system.
Limited privelege access to workers.
Enterprise as code as the goal - then IT service work can be PR'd against prod branch.


## Company templates
Chromebooks have a better application isolation mechanism, which makes it easier to manage, less viruses, less corruption.  The devices are cheaper, more resource efficient.  Framework devices are more repairable, and the cpu can be used as part of backup compute at EOL.  Same OS as mobiles, so all get treated the same way.

Make a live monitoring android app that gets installed.  Allows remote access and screen sharing.
Can connect a pool of workers with those with problems, sometimes with affinity.
