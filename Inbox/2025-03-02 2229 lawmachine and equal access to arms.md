Once we start, we have an arbitrage period where others won't catch us.
Then we have a struggle where we have to be the best intelligence supplier - so long as we're getting paid maybe a million a year for the whole effort, that should be enough to buy the best ideas.
Then if our own weapons turn against us, the fight goes to its endgame, and genuine hard won justice is found.

So at the start, easy cheap victories, plus product growth, so we should save this for the endgame.
Competitors enter, revenue all round, genuine honing of skills, if adversaries not using these tools, still easy wins, eventually they use these systems, and possibly use lawyers loyal to us.
Equal weapons for all, probably we will wield better, but the advantage not so clear, so genuine justice ensues.  We would have made a lot of money along the way, have thriving product lines, and the damage done in the early days would still scar the adversary.
