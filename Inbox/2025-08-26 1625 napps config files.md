instead of tools being functions, tools could be mcp servers.
the tools could rewrite what those mcp functions presented as.
or the mcp server can be passed straight thru.

but we do need this to be static code ? so the static code is what gets referenced, and when it gets reified, it gets used on the artifact host to boot and present these mcp tools, with whatever limits are required, into the agent.

This means we don't need any of that kind of thing to occur inside codex, and rather we just manage all that artifact side.
