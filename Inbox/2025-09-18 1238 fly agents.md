boot sequence of an agent specifies what workspace the agent needs, which may include what tools they will need or other provisionings, but ultimately determines what github repos they will need access to.

initially we will just check out from github directly, but ideally we would run a git folder, maintain worktrees for different workspaces, and also have the canonical copy on the server anyway, so that we have bery little lag and very little duplicated data.
