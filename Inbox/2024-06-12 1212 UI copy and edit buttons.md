Make the avatar, when focused, become a speed dial button.

When collapse the accordion, the speedial collapses too.

When expand, the copy, edit, share buttons become available.

For any actor that is not you, you can copy.
For any assistant, you can cause regeneration.
For you, you can also edit as well as copy.

May add read aloud text.

Meta button would allow you to have a chat about that response, which is good for saying something about the response, how it should have been, filing a stuck, etc.  Might allow a popup modal where you can take some notes that you can go back to later, without polluting the current conversation.
