Make the avatar, when focused, become a speed dial button.

When collapse the accordion, the speedial collapses too.

When expand, the copy, edit, share buttons become available.

For any actor that is not you, you can copy.
For any assistant, you can cause regeneration.
For you, you can also edit as well as copy.

May add read aloud text.

Meta button would allow you to have a chat about that response, which is good for saying something about the response, how it should have been, filing a stuck, etc.  Might allow a popup modal where you can take some notes that you can go back to later, without polluting the current conversation.

Or just start a new chat about this part of the chat, and then be able to use a back or some other kind of history navigation to get back to where you were.

Breadcrumbs could be up the top and could act like a filesystem.

Can use the back button to go back to a previous session.
The thread is the unit of focus, which you navigate around.
We would also hold your logged in status up top.
Have a new session button at the tip of the breadcrumb trail.

Breadcrumbs give you a list of other sessions you could switch to.
At the end of the breadcrumb trail, button to make a new session parallel to current one, or ? button to have a chat about the whole conversation itself.  Drops you in to a routing session where you select what the meta agent to use is, which can be configured.
