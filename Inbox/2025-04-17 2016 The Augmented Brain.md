What I want is that whenever I say something or ask a question or present an idea, I would expect the cogs of the machine to start working away and looking at everything that I had ever said before, as well as the derivatives of that. The machine should have pre-processed these things to build them out, categorize them, and narrow them down. 

Furthermore, I would expect it to then go through my social network to grab ideas from peers that are near to me and build upon ideas in this way. It should really be seeking to execute on the ideas, highlight some outstanding questions, find some parallels, some metaphors where definitely works and also find other areas of similarity that may not be apparent at first blush.
