Means can easily track the sun
The height of extension can be used to control the angle the panels are at so the ideal angle is always chosen.
Pulling them down as a stack means the depth of the container they came in can be efficiently used.
Once stacked down, can easily be slid out for maintenance of cleaning.
Height of tower means can often pierce thru occlusions.

The height plus the shape of the panels can act like a wind duct, which can drive wind turbines, to compliment the load.

The panels can act as rigidity within a tensegrity structure, so that it can sway easily making it durable and light.
