If it was given a runtime

Should the runtimes be napps too ?

Runtime is executed and given a json action, with a filesystem, and a napp, and told to give back a reply and a mutated filesystem, with some api gateway calls.

Comms from a napp, using artifact communication, should this be api gateway stuff ? or should it be treaded separately, as in what branches and repos this thing needs access to, or at least what interface it needs for making other calls to ?
