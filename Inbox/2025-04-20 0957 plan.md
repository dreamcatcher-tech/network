publish the artifact api to npm, so can use it in o3 ?

connection to data
- get the syncer working in the cli
- get the syncer working in the browser
- connect up to real data, showing in table

new capabilities in napps
- geocoding
- sector edits
- banking





restore vibe coding abilities
- publish to npm using a straight bundler of jsr packages
- try include source maps ? so maybe use vite for that.
