if we have a gateway app that handles clerk, and then once the use has proved their clerkness, they get redirected to their computer.

they are their browser, rather than they are their computer, so they might have access to other computers based on their clerkid.

each computer is a folder on the server, named after their clerk id.
they can make other computers, but something in there points back to their clerkid.

have a gateway service that walks users thru the auth loop.  this is clustered.

Each computer has a clustered little image of fast machines that handle the incoming traffic, check auth, wake up workers, assign fibers to workers.
