If the base installer was electron based, then the apps you install can be updated in place by the publisher releasing new versions.  Means that updating is handled automatically for the application, the experience is like a desktop tho.  Plus can run different versions between different apps, and still make them feel like they are all yours.

Let you have multiple different chain machines that you can switch around between, like identities in chrome.
