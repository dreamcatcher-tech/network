Something needs to decide it is topic time.

for HAMR, this might be making a new remote branch each time we want a change, and so the experience is the users home directory, and the HAMR bots can only operate on this short lived thread, rather than a long thread.

So the topicator decides to start a new hamr thread each time it wants to get something done.  The human may converse with the hamr bots maybe ?

Be easier if the hamr bot was simple and consistent and not concerned with presentation in any way.  So hamr is mechanical, and then the presentation layer takes care of personal preferences.  It starts off with the recommended presentations, but then moves on.
