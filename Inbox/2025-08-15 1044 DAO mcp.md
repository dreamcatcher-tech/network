the mcp would let it browse the git repos, the git files, and then have some tools to allow it to file issues, or update projects.

so the projects repo would be readable by this bot.

the functions seem very small.

search tasks, read task chunk, 

then people run their own deep research agents on the tasks.

features:
1. let people chat away, and then when they are ready to make a proposal, trigger it, or click a button
2. let them share their chat as a whole ?
3. let the ai decide when what they're saying warrants saying in the main 'channel' where the main channel is key, non repeated  questions, answers, projects and status reports

with just those 4 types of events in the channel, we should be able to do anything ?  project creation, qs, as, project status.
