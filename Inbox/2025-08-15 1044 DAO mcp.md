the mcp would let it browse the git repos, the git files, and then have some tools to allow it to file issues, or update projects.

so the projects repo would be readable by this bot.

the functions seem very small.

search tasks, read task chunk, 

then people run their own deep research agents on the tasks.

features:
1. let people chat away, and then when they are ready to make a proposal, trigger it, or click a button
2. let them share their chat as a whole ?
3. let the ai decide when what they're saying warrants saying in the main 'channel' where the main channel is key, non repeated  questions, answers, projects and status reports

with just those 4 types of events in the channel, we should be able to do anything ?  project creation, qs, as, project status.

this could be applied for your own personal knowleddge base, it it is also multi party.

each person could also run their own copy, and submit up to these higher mcp servers.

the real issue is the influx of noise that any system will generate from the opinionated users.
if they're wrong often, what would that mean ?

We need primarily a way to ingest vast amounts of noisy chatter, and reduce it down to deduplicated concise stackoverflow style questions.

capture signatures from wallet addresses, and show the holdings.
be able to make nice pdf docs that have the NFT and STC holdings and the signatures that each person attached and signed.

I could set up just a bot as a way that people talk to me, others can talk however they want.

basically we need to get together a doc that everyone agrees to, and then signs it.
that is a very different kind of a DAO.

So the amount doesn't matter, but membership does matter.

allow transfer of membership.

? turn the consent into NFTs ?
? turn each doc into an NFT and signatories get minted a type of token.  Then funding gets minted a token too.  
Allow the class action tooling to be available to every other effort anyone wants to enact.

Participation in these projects is by being agrieved ?
many participants will want little bits of software built, so this meets participation requirement.

Just the ability to have class action activity, with debates, and AI powered document generation and explanation, blockchain funding, and blockchain transparency - that would be a fearsome thing.

Posting to twitter should be done with DAO consent, so we would see proposals go thru the pipeline, edits and rule checks

Governance key is that there are some basic rights that cannot be undone by a majority - a constutional republic type of thing - yes there are votes, but there are some things that cannot be changed.  We can't get that right first pop, but we should get there within a few months of solid use.  Also can game it and theorize about how different scenarios would be handled.

start with a human gate on all actions, so they get checked.
plan to remove the human gate.

We want equal information access to all, and equal tooling access, so that anyone can run deep research, or have access to the latest ai models.

Making a DAO with an mcp server would be broadly beneficial and would let people hook their own AI's up to it.

NFT'd facts - if we make a fact system, where any person can mint a statement, and can stake against it.  Others can do the same, either staking agreement, support, or funds.  Could stake with the NFT tokens themselves as a a marker.  It just signals importance.

A show of cash in the pool would be useful too.  Total staked funds, showing how much commitment there is against a particular lawsuit.

Hiring open legal advice on the case, in an open way.
Posting the progress of their review.
Getting the documents present in NFT'd form.

An mcp server where you can mint statements with graphics and tokens seems about the max thing that is needed for now ? generate images, host on ipfs.  We can provide an ipfs backup server, or a couple of them, to pin the data.

Facts or claims are introduces by parties, and then any other party can present them as true.  Can be anonymous or use satoshi items to support them.

mcp server can be independent of satoshi for this minting purpose, and can be minted for anything at all,  as well as minted for links to our protocol as well.

anyone can publish, but we badge as being unique, so we adorn them with some dynamic properties.

then we can start chain analysis.  start pulling in accounts as part of the historical data, and as part of the future data, which we watch.

Have a generalized staking place, where, with no obligation, you can stack funds against one of these job NFTs, or against any NFT.

facts should have some friction so we don't get spammed by them.
anyone can make a fact.
anyone can pay for the assessment system to run an analyze the fact, and it gets certified by an oracle.
on chain data entry should be from anyone, then the ai acts as an oracle that adorns the fact with a badge.
the fact checker can be run.
also it can run on the open web, too.

if we start with simply the foundation of the DAO, which is on chain, nft tasks, membership driven, ai controlled.
then we list out all the tasks we are doing in nft form.

From there, all the updates are just tasks, and we may present a summary tweet every so often, in automated fashion.
