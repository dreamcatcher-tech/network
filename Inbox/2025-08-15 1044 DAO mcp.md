the mcp would let it browse the git repos, the git files, and then have some tools to allow it to file issues, or update projects.

so the projects repo would be readable by this bot.

the functions seem very small.

search tasks, read task chunk, 

then people run their own deep research agents on the tasks.

features:
1. let people chat away, and then when they are ready to make a proposal, trigger it, or click a button
2. let them share their chat as a whole ?
3. let the ai decide when what they're saying warrants saying in the main 'channel' where the main channel is key, non repeated  questions, answers, projects and status reports

with just those 4 types of events in the channel, we should be able to do anything ?  project creation, qs, as, project status.

this could be applied for your own personal knowleddge base, it it is also multi party.

each person could also run their own copy, and submit up to these higher mcp servers.

the real issue is the influx of noise that any system will generate from the opinionated users.
if they're wrong often, what would that mean ?

We need primarily a way to ingest vast amounts of noisy chatter, and reduce it down to deduplicated concise stackoverflow style questions.

capture signatures from wallet addresses, and show the holdings.
be able to make nice pdf docs that have the NFT and STC holdings and the signatures that each person attached and signed.

I could set up just a bot as a way that people talk to me, others can talk however they want.

basically we need to get together a doc that everyone agrees to, and then signs it.
that is a very different kind of a DAO.

So the amount doesn't matter, but membership does matter.

allow transfer of membership.

? turn the consent into NFTs ?
? turn each doc into an NFT and signatories get minted a type of token.  Then funding gets minted a token too.  
Allow the class action tooling to be available to every other effort anyone wants to enact.

Participation in these projects is by being agrieved ?
many participants will want little bits of software built, so this meets participation requirement.

Just the ability to have class action activity, with debates, and AI powered document generation and explanation, blockchain funding, and blockchain transparency - that would be a fearsome thing.
