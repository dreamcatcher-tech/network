We should keep track of a a repo of all the jobs of the whole system ? but this should just point to the genesis branch of each repo, which does its own job tracking.

With access to the genesis branch, then you can find the job ids ?

streaming on a file being written is like listening in on the consensus forming work.

we should be able to have listeners on multiple consensus runners simultaneously streaming in results.
