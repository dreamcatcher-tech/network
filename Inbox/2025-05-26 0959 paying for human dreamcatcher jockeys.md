we should post jobs that require a human to drive the machine.  We can provide tokens for attempts, and we pay a prize for solving.

we have a small guard that ensures the tokens are deployed towards the task.  We can allow blended tokens, where you can use your own tokens if the token guard decides the question is not relevant.  

With a certain amount of direct queries, we do allow some grace, so long as the majority is directed towards our goal.

if you justify your thinkinging, then likley it will be permitted.

basically saying there are problems or tasks in the system, and we'd pay to have them solved, because the AI hasn't bee nable to solve them directly.
