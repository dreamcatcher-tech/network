[[Ambient Attribution]] can be applied to a trained AI model.  So whenever someone pays for the AI usage, a portion goes back to everyone who provided training data that got used in the model.  In fact the ultimate [[Ambient Attribution]] algorithm is a trained one, which pays out to everyone who used this system early.

Charging for AI processing is easy to justify if the dataset is too large to fit on your local computer.  Running locally is less easy to enforce, but in large orgs it becomes more easy to pressure people to pay.
