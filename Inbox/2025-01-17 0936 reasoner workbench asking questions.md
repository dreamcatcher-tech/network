Every time that we stop and ask the user for a question, we should attempt to generate plausible responses from it. These will be treated as branches in the thread. We will go forth and speculatively carry out these imagined answers. Along the way, periodically, we will come back to the question we asked and see if it's actually a valid question or not. If it is no longer relevant, we'll remove it. The record will still remain and it can be browsed, but it's no longer presented to the user as a question that needs an answer. In this way, we may work our way through the problem. It's interesting to note that this type of effect occurs in humans, where if they just try and do something to do with the problem, often the questions they ask become answered. So it seems like these are not just issues of humans, because we were relating intelligence to humans, but they are really just issues of intelligence.

So we use tools, like linters, and execution environments, to attempt to solve the problem at hand.

The problem of making a reasoning workbench appears to come down to looking at threads that have occurred, figuring out why they went wrong, and implementing fixes that would cause those thread errors to not occur again. If we present the system in a way that these threads can be easily flagged on surface to then surely, with tuning, very quickly the system will behave highly as expected by getting our users to be part of the fixing of them. We cast a wide net for collaborators that used to be called staff members, but we also allow everyday people to feel more like they know what's going on, particularly if they can use the intelligence of the system to query the inner workings of the system. It's like having the help manual and the author with you at every time, and you can ask questions about how it works so that you can understand it, and if it's behaving in a way that doesn't make sense to you, you can raise this problem, but also the bot will help you give strong reasons why that's important, and possibly solve it for you as well.
