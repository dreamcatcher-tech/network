If the public chain was about shared compute load, and the currency was about taking part of the market take and paying that by burning / redeeming the currency, then we can start mining with just one computer.

We should start with AWS lambda, and offer the services at cost + small margin.

People offering free services benefit from earning the currency.

The currency can be transferred frictionlessly, and because it is redeemable for a set price, it should hold value well at approximately the going rate for CPU resources.  Offering large amounts of compute for free would lower its value, but since this cannot be sustained, the value will always stabilize.

Redemption is done by lining it up against the current thruput, and receiving some of the payments coming in from cpu purchasers.  This can be whitelisted to avoid getting dirty money.

Overall issuance projections can be computed from usage. Future value can be determined.

We can reward early coins more than later ones, by paying out attribution whenever the currency is minted.

Combat the deflation effects of cost of computing dropping by changing the ratio of currency that is accepted.  As the price goes down for compute, the power of the joules can be raised.
