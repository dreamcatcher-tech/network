If the public chain was about shared compute load, and the currency was about taking part of the market take and paying that by burning / redeeming the currency, then we can start mining with just one computer.

We should start with AWS lambda, and offer the services at cost + small margin.

People offering free services benefit from earning the currency.

The currency can be transferred frictionlessly, and because it is redeemable for a set price, it should hold value well at approximately the going rate for CPU resources.  Offering large amounts of compute for free would lower its value, but since this cannot be sustained, the value will always stabilize.

Redemption is done by lining it up against the current thruput, and receiving some of the payments coming in from cpu purchasers.  This can be whitelisted to avoid getting dirty money.

Overall issuance projections can be computed from usage. Future value can be determined.

We can reward early coins more than later ones, by paying out attribution whenever the currency is minted.

Combat the deflation effects of cost of computing dropping by changing the ratio of currency that is accepted.  As the price goes down for compute, the power of the joules can be raised.

The issuance rate could be set based on a learning algorithm, so that it sees what behaviours are occuring, and pics the best issuance rate based on the goals of the system. Training and optimizing the model on the data is a form of mining that lets people check the model is better than previous, does solve the original data, and only then do they start applying it.

System goals are stability, value capture, and governance out of human hands.  It starts with different confidence bounds until we are confident it has been trained sufficiently.

It is an application of the general purpose data training functions of the Dreamcatcher, which can use computational energy of dataset training to prove work.  It optimizes its own currency governance, and can be used to optimize other things too.

General attribution rewards could be tackled in this way too, with goals and params set so the algo can be upgraded when a better one occurs that fits all the data better.  This is a leap, and the training of the model is incremental mining.

The coin can purposefully have a strong decentralization metric, so it only issues when enough decentralization is detected, making it clearly not a security.
