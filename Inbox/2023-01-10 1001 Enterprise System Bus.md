Not just a bus, nor an audit / backup software, nor machine orchestration, but an ecosystem where apps can be created with standard interfaces, large pools of available developers can compete for price discovery, apps can be reused between enterprises.

Bus can connect to external providers like extra compute, quantum processing, emailing.

Bus can run completely offline.  Bus can be used to study blackbox services to know what you actually use and how it might be replaced.

Orchestrate by using the bus to control the machines and the power banks.
