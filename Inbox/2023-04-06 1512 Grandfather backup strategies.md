Can use Pulse Fluffing to target aligning with planned backup cycles.
The backups are backwards, in that they involve purging all data except the snapshotted pulses.
To minimize the data in the Cram that is not part of the intended backup set, the pulses should pull forwards data that they need, and leave old data to go stale and be purged.
