To iterate a new version, we should give it the same data, and then get back the same results from running various operations on, basically checking that for the next N days, it will generate the same results as the previous system.

If we separate out the front end from the backend logic, then we can upgrade the cosmetic front rapidly, but the logic core stays functional.
