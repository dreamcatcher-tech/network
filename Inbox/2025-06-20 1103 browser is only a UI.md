The logic should always be server side, and the browser should be forever thin.
It has good isolation qualities, as it can render isolated ui.
It should never be trying to do calculations.

We should vend an app that is certed and tested and runs as a service on a server, or as a desktop that gives the full power of the server, but locally, and can coordinate with other servers.

It then presents an electron ui gui.

It has full OS power.

Ultimately we want our own OS with everything stripped out except the kernel for hardware interactions.

Then we want the hardware to be AI developed with the drivers at the same time, with these discovery / tuning loops to keep moving them forwards.  All the costs that used to be for labour now go to a select few who are incentivized to know deeply what's going on and to innovate thru it.

Its not that deployment is too bad - its the it should be entirely handled by bots and never thought about.  Building a system to fully remove deployment is good, but it limits what we can achieve.   Altho perhaps if we used AI to make web interfaces in super simple ways, that might not matter so much.
