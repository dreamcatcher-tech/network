So basically, if we could use o1 pro to grind away on figuring out what our specs are, and guiding our decisions as to what to do next, telling us what data and metrics we should be looking for, generating formulas, and updating content any time any particular thing changes, this should be the only way we operate.

We are simply not smart enough to make all these decisions, but we definitely know how to steer, or oversee it.

Going in to negotiations, helping with sales prep training, overseeing all comms.

Figuring out payment rates and amounts for people by looking at their whole situation.

It would respond to all questions that people asked, it would both be the product and manage the product.

If we could fine tune o1 to be very good about strategic reasoning, and weighing the pros and cons of many different paths, then we could have a thing that can guide us, even partially lead us, and each decision is highly defendable.

We can then adversarially attack it, and whenever it concedes, we add that to training data to make sure that it doesn't make that mistake again.

So each time there is an error, or a stuck, we add that to fine tuning to ensure no problems.

So adding this piece in at the top level of a company, particularly if the service was helped with expert humans, this would be like dropping management consulting in with a model that everyone could query, and some expert humans keep things on track, but largely the AI is running things.
