So basically, if we could use o1 pro to grind away on figuring out what our specs are, and guiding our decisions as to what to do next, telling us what data and metrics we should be looking for, generating formulas, and updating content any time any particular thing changes, this should be the only way we operate.

We are simply not smart enough to make all these decisions, but we definitely know how to steer, or oversee it.

Going in to negotiations, helping with sales prep training, overseeing all comms.

Figuring out payment rates and amounts for people by looking at their whole situation.

It would respond to all questions that people asked, it would both be the product and manage the product.
