If we make it so our client apps in the browser can use multiple backends concurrently, and the backends can coordinate with each other, then we make it possible to have a local node that also acts like a server / peer.

So the server isn't terribly special any more, since it acts as a peer, and the client just connects to the relevant peer, which can be several.
