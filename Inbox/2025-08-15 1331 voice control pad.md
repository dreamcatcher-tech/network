to operate a voice model we should have:
1. push to talk
2. push to pause
3. replay
4. skip back
5. regenerate
6. regen with new input
7. delete last model response
8. delete last user response

the model should know when these buttons were pushed, so it can react accordingly.
When we interupt we should show the modle how far thru its generation we got, or just truncate its generation at that point.

Just makes it more pleasant to go hands free.

the voice model should be just doing tool calls and summaries based on smarter models doing reasoning.
