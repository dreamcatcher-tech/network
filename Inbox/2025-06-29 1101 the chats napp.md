can it export its schemas without hauling in backend code ?
the front end needs to use these schemas to recover the structure of the messages.

worst case we need two packages exported, one that handles the client side things, like schemas and helper functions, and one that runs on the server.

? mocking of the api calls ?
these should be just checking that we called the ai sdk fetch function correctly ? 
use the mock functions of the ai sdk to test everything about our pipeline.

the initial config file, which is written to disk and sometimes updated, is how we choose what to call with.

chat format:
- use a ulid to specify a filename, which is unique to us.  there is no need to make a globally unique and collision free id.
	- we could just apply a counter ? the ulid means we don't have to read anything to create something
- messages are just an index.json, so 0.json, 10.json, but is segmented per user id, so for multiple users, the home repoid is used to order things.  
- adding a new message, the user finds what is the highest number for them, and then creates this new message

new chats:
- ulid to create a filename


useArtifact needs to pass in some config information about the current execution, like what is the installed path.

? how can a napp be restricted to altering only a particular path ?
