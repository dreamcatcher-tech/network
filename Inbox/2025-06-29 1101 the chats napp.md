can it export its schemas without hauling in backend code ?
the front end needs to use these schemas to recover the structure of the messages.

worst case we need two packages exported, one that handles the client side things, like schemas and helper functions, and one that runs on the server.

? mocking of the api calls ?
these should be just checking that we called the ai sdk fetch function correctly ?
