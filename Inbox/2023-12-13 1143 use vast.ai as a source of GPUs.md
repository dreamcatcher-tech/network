We would rent their GPUs and then run our software to resell this capacity on a jobbing basis, with the required redundancy.

Means we can learn the quirks of each individual GPU, and show how resale of untrusted hardware can be relied upon due to redundancy.  But, that this redundancy also gives reliability of result, gives good timing reliability since it races the outputs, can be moved around to suit edge workloads - move the cloud closer to the consumer - and can also be trusted due to redundancy.

Makes all runs valuable, since if you're not first, you are also checking and reinforcing.

So you'd download the dreamcatcher as an electron app, this deploys the service that keeps it running, and then you can manage everything from chain.

We can offer certified in datacentre jobbing that is used for privacy focused workloads.  Data sovereign workloads can be run in this fashion too.
