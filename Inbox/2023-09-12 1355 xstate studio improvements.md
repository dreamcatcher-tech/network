Make little dashboards that can surface some part of the context, to help guide the user thru the statechart.  Offer some help snippets based on state they are in.

Connect up to production usage of the statechart, where the transitions are phoned home to be used as coverage and testing telemetry.

Use test filters in a visual way, to pincer of certain states, and watch the path generation behaviour differently when different visual test restriction elements are given. 
List out the generated paths.
Visually pincer different states, and annotate the statechart with visual connections that show it under test.
