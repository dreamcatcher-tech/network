Being able to have advanced AI and then sharing this with friends in some context seems useful.

Also great way to let new people sample with us.

If you share with friends, we will give them x free credits to try it out.

If they sign up and consume with us, we will give you more free credits.

the free credits could be restricted so some pro mode ops run out faster ?

Storing your files with us should be a preferred option, since we are reliable, chatable, very cheap, plus you can own your files, and choose from storage options, choosing redundancy options too, so can be super cheap, or highly reliable like b2.
