Can require a soulbound token that says you have signed up to be NDA punished in a suitable jurisdiction, and there have been no proven breaches of shared data.

Breach can be proven by submitting some data and decrypting it, when that tx did not come from the soulbound token holder at that time.

So a single breach would revoke the token, and a pool may form of the aggrieved.

Can encrypt to a given address so only those can see it, or can run an oracle service where anyone with sufficient soulbound rights can receive their own fingerprinted encrypted version, so that any breach will include the stego fingerprint in it.

Stego printing service that manages your ID documents, so any breach can be traced since you make a unique version every time someone asks for it.
