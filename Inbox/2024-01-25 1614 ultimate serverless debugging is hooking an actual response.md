If I can step thru it on my machine as tho the debugger was running remotely, this is the ultimate.

If I can replay the server calculations with blockchain grade fidelity in the repetition, this amounts to the same, but is better since I can replay, rather than simply intercept.

The pain is that once the serverless functions are deployed, recreating their invocations is hard.  Having repeatable computation is critical in these cases.  Particularly if side effects like an API call are also captured for replay too.  If you had access to both systems, then you could replay on both sides, but at the very least, you can include these tests in your regression testing once solved, so they never cause problems again.
