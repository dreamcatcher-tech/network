For example, with a project layout file, we would provide a prior example, and maybe some example files, and then ask for the scaffolding of the new project to be created, which draws on the thinking of what came before, to ensure it starts off in the right direction.

All work would need to have changes to the project layout approved.

Approved means o1 thinks it is best to make the changes proposed.

We should be able to chat with o1 to get the changes made, and convince the bot of what we want.

Then, we would tune up this top level guidance piece as work progresses, so it covers everything we needed.  Maybe this is a little dedicated napp, that has issues and other things ?

Its function could be to generate a prompt or do some concats of an existing project, such that we can make a layout file at the top level.


o1 should be able to assemble summaries of our conversations so it can produce supercuts.

Should be able to pull in supercuts of other youtube clips too.


So then for different types of file, like a code module, different base parts of the layout template would be included.
