If physical products were considered geometry, then we can make them as trees of components the same as we make software.

Each component can have its unit tests to ensure it meets its published interface specifications.

Geomtry code can be parsed to see who added the most useful features.
All geometry can be represented as software models.

The products made using this method should be better suited to the purpose than to a specific design - they model the problem, and attempt to solve it the best way in the most malleable possible form, taking in to account
1. Supplier contraints - materials, timeframes, labour pricing, tooling availability
2. Local specifics - temperature, terrain
3. available components / options and existing components / designs

The product should be described as its complete supply chain, so that a "best" definition can be determined that is wholistic, and improvements in the complete chain are possible.
