Optionally add pieces of the triad, like commit and filepath ?

Triads need to have url params unified as well as be inside function parameters.

HASH BEHAVIOUR

If no hash, then as soon as the backchat thread loads up, set the hash to be the current target thread.

If the target changes, and the hash was in sync with the target, then change the hash.

If there is a hash, and any time the hash changes:
- check if the hash matches the current remote target in the backchat thread


When the drop the remote modal, the hash changes back.

Should there be a remote button to pull this back up, if remote is set ? like a go back to remote button ?
Close remote would show in the message stream, and then when they click on it again, the thread pops up.
