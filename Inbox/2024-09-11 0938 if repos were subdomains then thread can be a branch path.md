Optionally add pieces of the triad, like commit and filepath ?

Triads need to have url params unified as well as be inside function parameters.

HASH BEHAVIOUR

If no hash, then as soon as the backchat thread loads up, set the hash to be the current target thread.

If the target changes, and the hash was in sync with the target, then change the hash.

If there is a hash, and any time the hash changes:
- check if the hash matches the current remote target in the backchat thread


When the drop the remote modal, the hash changes back.

Should there be a remote button to pull this back up, if remote is set ? like a go back to remote button ?
Close remote would show in the message stream, and then when they click on it again, the thread pops up.

Changing the remote shows as a fake tool call in the messages thread.

If the change in invalid, the error should make its way back to the client.

If we specify something invalid, it should blank.
What if the show remote also has a show remote ? Clicking show remote inside that remote would switch the remote again ? 
Then closing would go back thru the stack again ?

Selecting remote selection tool calls in the message thread would bring up the remote selection ?  But that ruins using the messages like an extended stateboard.

? how to view historic remote threads ?
If that thread has a remote, that seems even weirder ?

If the whole thing showed in the stateboard ?

USE THE STATEBOARD to guide the remote thread usage ?
In the stateboard, it can list the remotes, arbitrarily deep ?

show remote inside a remote would drop back to base thread and change the remote again?
Or, open up the remote navigator ?
