When learning about how to use the backblaze api, for example, we should be able to store all these little bits since they're relevant to the project.

Also store pivotal points, like being able to do SES sending for a single verified address.

Can flag these with different needs of verification, like assuming a decentralized AI passes howe test is very different to assuming a certain api call will work correctly.

We could even get the bots to help reason out these critical assumptions, and reduce down our gamble on success to simple succinct phrases.
