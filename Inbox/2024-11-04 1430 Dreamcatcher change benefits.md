Key property of the dreamcatcher that builders should value is the speed at which new tools arrive, merged across all the available providers.

Also people can sketch out new theories in NL, and score them as tho they were coded, then get humans or bots to code up versions of the algos.

Basically as soon as a new API drops we should have it available in a few hours after.

The speed of release seems to be far more important now.

Automated upgrades, where evals are rerun against new models to make upgrade decisions.

The ability to upgrade swiftly, cheaply, constantly - this makes us better.

The flexibility to anything.

Model single bot builders and sellers, and let them set up support channels with help easily, as well as detecting problems with bots, and accepting improvements from anyone.

Value those who have sales relationships, and let us all help them deepen those, as well as offering sales coaching.
