Be able to rapidly make agents that do various things using the web page browsing primitives.

While you're browsing, the system would go off and find other pages that were similar.
As you ask questions, it goes and tries to find those answers elsewhere.

So you have your primary page, then secondary pages showing up the side or something.

So ideally you would do all your search and browsing thru our platform using your agents.
