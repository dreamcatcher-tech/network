So the gateway company would be franchises that have rights to use the registered trademark, and get priority from the funding services.

Each venture inside the gateway uses "trading as" to represent their own brand in the contracts it is entering in to.

Ventures would pay per contract, since that requires automated review with some human review.  The behaviour of the venture is monitored by the AI systems for compliance.

We do not need fancy setups like SPACs or series LLCs to start with, as this can all be accomplished under a regular trading company.
