Because what fair means is the heart of collaboration - that's what we have to all accept and agree to, in order that the mechanism move forwards.  So the training of the system, the training epochs, these are what everyone agrees to.  The transactions all have to be processed using this system of attribution.

Consensus is basically just agreeing to a set of rules, and so agreeing to what is fair is even heavier.

Without consensus on attribution at its heart, people will be uncertain how they would get paid.

But we would be restricting everyone to operate under a single banner.

If competiting forms occured ?

Changes can dissent can be captured in the protocol, which contribute to its steerability, but you still have to accept what it says at the start.
