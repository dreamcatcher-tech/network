we could use metadata on the machines to maintain their mappings ?
and then just never delete the machines for compression / efficiency - who cares about the bill for now.

means that, for an installation, there is a router, which contains a self agent, and this self agent can create new standard agents (could just use the same image....) which it has named metadata on which is used for the ids.
