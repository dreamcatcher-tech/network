first, launch a sidecar business that is pure ai to test if people prefer the new interface.

then, in parallel, transform the company to be AI run.
you have to transform the business to be not dependent on the owner operator anyway, so might as well transition to AI run.
then list it on a stock market, so that the owner exit is done partially, trading down over time, avoiding upsets in the staff structure.

we can map the career paths of all the people who started up incrementally better stock markets.

these new techs, like smart glasses making store attendees super smart.
it might be that the in person store helper is far better than the kiosk ? they can have personal relationships, but they just have access to the full power of the stores ai.
