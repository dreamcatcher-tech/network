To do a search, the search chain would be instructed to build up a list of children that match the query, so that the UI just displays this chain.

Locally, this thing is disposable, and so it only ever reads from the source chains.

Some might be in but get removed later, and should be marked as uncertain, eg: max would show different values as the search progressed.
