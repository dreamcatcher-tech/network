If we could find a way to make a complete deployment of Artifact being used as purely a database without the complexities of the execution layer, then that whole system could be quite easily understood by a bot for one, but a human for another. And so, when we want companies to switch to using this format for their underlying data structures, one that is completely understandable will be preferred to one that is closed source, proprietary and large. Particularly if we pass all the metrics like performance and other such things, recovery.

So present artifact as modules that do different functions, so the simplicity is more apparent than a monolith.
