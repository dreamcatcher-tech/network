This piece is crucial for pressure to pay in a completely open source ecosystem.
If we have a large collection of api calls that can be accessed as simply as asking your AI to hook them up, and if calls to them require all your bills to be up to date, then whilst you can run our software for free, to connect to the network, you need to have paid.

Vendors will always insist on being charged, so they want to support paid usage.  So users would likely pay since free versions would lack the utility of the paid API calls.

So every service should go thru this, and this is the reason to keep paying to use our platform, even after you have mastered how it works and could run it on your own infrastructure.


Could deno deploy be part of this api too, and you need to supply keys to be able to run it ?
