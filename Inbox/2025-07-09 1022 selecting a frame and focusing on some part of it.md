eg: switch to the chats frame, and focus on the input box, or, prepopulate it with some text.

We could have an agent drive over the top and interact with the UI directly, but it seems easier to allow api access.

So the frame would expose napp like methods that an AI could drive against.
This could allow alterations of ephemeral state, like form fields.
It could also transfer config files and json files that the frame could populate fields with.

Maybe a frame should be totally standalone as opposed to some server side and some front end ?
