If this model is represented on chain, and shared with all, then can a TLA+ model of all the comms be constructed so we can prove continuity under some theoretical maximum stress ?

This would allow us to design our validator comms and then give some guarantees about its operation.

Hopefully the implementation can tie into the model somehow and assure us the model has been replicated faithfully.
