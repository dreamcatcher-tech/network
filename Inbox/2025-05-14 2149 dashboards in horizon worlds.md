we could put image widgets with urls on the walls, and refresh them periodically.  This can show whatever dashboards or widgets or screens we want.  We can then stick things up all over the place just by chatting about it, and it will show this images.

Have easels or tablets that contain images that lightly update to represent some information we want to talk about. If the person has their browser available when they touch on it, it would bring up a more detailed view in their browser.
