Using deno we should be able to marshal external services, like cpu and compute.
Ultimately we want to replace deno and run ourselves on this layer, but we need a certain level of resilience first.

We need to make a decentralized kv queue and kv store, where the version stamp is somehow determined in a decentralized way.

So if services can be consumed using our repo model, then we can ultimately operate on top of those resources ourselves one day.

A lot of money from renting GPUs for AI training.

We should make amazon resources available in this way, since we would have an easier programming and consumption model, and make it possible for you to move on prem any time with ease.
