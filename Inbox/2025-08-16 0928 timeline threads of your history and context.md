clicking on the repo button would load up the repo tools, and a bot with prompts to work with the repos list.  It might be muted in that it cannot load other tools, but it can switch to other agents.

So it is intentionally limited, but it is very good at what it does.

When you switch agents, that chat might be condensed and just added to context as a file that can be searched within, but it just scrunches down in the current context as a summary unless the bot asks to dig in to it.

It's there just so the machine doesn't lose track of whatever you've been talking about, and it can be done with other humans or channels, if you switch to being in that channel and then do some stuff or read some stuff, it goes in there, like a historical feed.

So these threads, they are like trains of thought - thought trains.

They represent your history.

so it could be actually a single thread ? 
when you start talking to someone, it captures what you spoke to them about, and what they said, and it knows what you saw there.

Because the nature of ai work is moving somewhere else bringing with you portions of the prior context, this mode suits best ?

so the history is a separate element, and the bots you chat with in the stateboard almost ?
the history seems like the transclude place / context management ?

having new history sessions is possible, but possibly confusing, since you did only have one thread, really.  so you could have incognito sessions ?
you could merge and summarize the sessions ?

> SOMEWHERE THE MACHINE HAS TO KNOW EVERYTHING YOU DID AND IN ORDER

This means we have to track it, and expose it to you, and let you modify it.  Context can only come from history - selecting context in other words is selecting history to bring into the present chat.

this timeline thing, should be where the ongoing conversation happens.
To manage your timelines, would be a chat to the timelines bot, and a stateboard piece that shows all the timelines in a tree so they can be worked on, like any other file.

Key seems to be looping the current session of anything into the current thread as context, by allowing it to see the files that the current thread represents.

You could go back into a prior context thing, expand it, like a previous chat, and pull in more context, to use in the current context.  This would show as a revist, and then the expansion actions.

reversing and forking should be captured too, where you went back and restarted from that point in time ? we just bump that to the front of the linear line, and point back to where it came from, as a restart point.   you should not be able to alter history other than to delete it.  It is created by what you do, not created by you doing to it.

It should allow you to wire up context between stateboards / sinks - so I should be in a group chat, and I can go wire up some files that stay live, or a jitter session, or even another chat as the context I am sharing in another chat.

All these data links probably need managing too.

have background agents that trigger off what happens in this history.
surface their suggestions as decorations on the timeline.
config the background agents in the timeline management panel.  Config in general or per specific timeline.
data format of a timeline is just an event stream ?
agents can be working but hidden, so have a widget that lets you expand.
when an agent has something useful to say it can pop up as a note, or it can feed it in to the current bot as context.  Have some privacy considerations before auto attaching.
wrap swarms of agents in a single agent so it just presents as a single one.  show token burn and ongoing tasks.  show scores, so how often it got it right by how often the user indicated (by click or in chat) to use what the background rover found.

can add bots or chats with people to the sidebar, so you can quickly switch to them.

we still discard transient switches around until you do something ? or we at least compact it.
the analytics of the system should be part of your own context.
app optimization from analytics can be entirely private on your end, rather than handled by the devs - before only the devs could do this so they had a need for your analytics, now bots can do it so the analytics are yours entirely.

depending on settings, and agent may have access to the timeline, or it might be isolated and "narrowed".
When calling another agent, the clipboard can be included automatically ?

each state changing event on the timeline would show as an item - click to expand it onto the stateboard.
A chat might show as a standalone chat ?
the chat might expand in the timeline view ?
show it as a git graph, where you can select multiple items.
Allows backtracking.
agents can backtrack, and then put a marker so they don't go down the previous branch.

When viewing another agents timelines, we can see everything that occured to them.

when switching bots, we can opt to go back to the previous context, or we can allow the bot to see the timeline, as well as the timeline depth.

operator agent would be able to switch out the running agent for you and exist, so it hands over and then the next agent is up.

when click on a chat, the input box appears at the base, to allow you to carry it on.
esc will drop the box down to the bottom of the thread.
Or a button that you click to indicate you want to resume the thread, which will shift it down to the bottom of the timeline ?
When working on something, other portion of the timeline interleaving the chat are compressed down.

Or, selecting makes it be an attachment to the current chat, but select again makes it be the chat you are resuming, causing everything in between to become context.  Pick a specific item in the chat to make that become the context.  Can pick stateboard changes to have that change the stateboard.

Can hide events form the timeline, like UI events, like scrolling, moveing, whatever.
This is the train of thought, and everything you do is captured here, including interacting with your history.

Universal threading.
The hunt for a universal agent.
