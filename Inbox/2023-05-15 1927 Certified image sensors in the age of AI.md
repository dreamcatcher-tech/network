Each image sensor should sign with a crypto key that is hardware based, so the image is steganographically implanted with the image sensor that made it, making it impossible to alter it.

Certified images mean it definitely came from a sensor.

Can do the same with GPS locations, so the sensor signs it for authenticity at the silicon level.

Acts like https but for media.

So when presenting any media, need to present the source and the transforms that were done to it, so that your software can verify that the media has not been altered meaningfully from the original source.
