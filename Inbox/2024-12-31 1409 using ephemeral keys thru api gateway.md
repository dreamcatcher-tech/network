If I want to make a non artifact app, but still use the gateway, then I would simply log in to the artifact network, then I would have the ability to rack up debt against an api gateway.

So I could make an app like a realtime app that needed an api gateway key, and I could auth with just the gateway, and then start using its features, like a request to get an ephemeral openai key.

This key would then have billing done against it, so we could track usage.

Saves anyone having to set up their own accounts and keys.
