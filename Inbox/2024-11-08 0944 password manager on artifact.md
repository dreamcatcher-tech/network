Instead of making a browser extension, we should make all browsing happen inside artifact, so the browser is actually remote.

Using remote browser isolation so that the client browser only sees a single site - artifact.

Then the browser sessions get persisted, and shared on the social network.

The password manager is used in this context, so there is not an external password manager in user space to handle.  The user need only enter the artifact network safely, and once inside all other security concerns are handled by the platform.

We also have a semantic firewall that filters out bad meanings, and summarizes everything, and always presents summaries of multiple pages on a particular topic.

If we could have an endpoint that did everything thru the platform, then we could lock down the physical device too, and so we could stop data exfiltration, and all other endpoint concerns.

So the physical device comes totally locked, and all work related activities are occurring inside the platform.

The browsers then become workers or agents, and can be instructed to do varioius things by the staff.  They can set up watches on pages, automated responses, or whatever.
