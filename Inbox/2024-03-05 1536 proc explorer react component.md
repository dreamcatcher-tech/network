If we make a component that can watch each session and all the children of the session, then we can see inside the branches.
This can help us see how the system is executing, so that things don't get lost in the void.

This component is probably always useful and can be the default component for the stateboard.  Visibility seems the most important thing to get.

At each process, we should be able to view the files.
Then pick several processes, and show the diffs in the filesystem between the branches.

Could make a version of tig that is triggered every time there is a commit.
Commits are the only actual thing, really.
So something like tig, where each commit it shows some stats about the branch and the commit that just occured.

Being able to snapshot a complete repo state and then load it up again could prove very useful ?
