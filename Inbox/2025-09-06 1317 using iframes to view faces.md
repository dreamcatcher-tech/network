we can combine multiple views into one by using an agents face to compose other faces.

the key is that the combining logic is done inside an agent, so server side.
but the client does the rendering of the iframe and does the fetching from the agent view.

this part is key, since it means the client does the heavy work of fulfilling the iframe.
