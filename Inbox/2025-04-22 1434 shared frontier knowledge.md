Each time the model browses the web to try and determine what is the truth of things (like what is the current recommended best practice of situation XYZ). This should present itself within a self-made Wikipedia shared by all the bots shared by the friendship links between the people who the bots serve. 

Next time the question is asked or even the topic is raised, the reconciled latest information is pulled in. Additional checks can be done to make sure that these items are in fact true. And what fact checkers you subscribe to determines what the tip of your Wikipedia thing looks like. 

You can make this, you can cause it to do more research. Each time an item gets used and you paid for tokens to refine it, you will receive some payback. If you debunk it, you will receive a reward. 

If you detract or contest with what the network provided value is, then this is your fork, your unique view. Others may come to share it over time. It can show in searches when someone is looking for the truth, then you might show up as one out of ten dissenting. 

The model can then weigh how much your opinion is worth to whatever goal it is pursuing, and it might use that dissent somehow.
