we can make an mcp server that runs different tasks from the package.json file.
the size of these machines can be different based on the task.

so for just browsing around, you can use a very light cheap machine, but then when you to run something, a new instance of a heavy machine fires up, and only runs for the duration of the task.

these same tools get used for automating build pipelines.
