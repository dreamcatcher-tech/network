Basically when there are options, these should be fully fleshed out as tho you would have chosen them, but then you click on them and go into the paths.  You can alter them by saying something, but they allow the info to be compartmentalized, so you can switch between it easily without getting drowned.

This can be for code, where different architectural processes are described before proceeding.
