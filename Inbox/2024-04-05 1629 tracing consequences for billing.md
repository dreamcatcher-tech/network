If the only actions allowed in were pierce, 

Each session would have the client data

Otherwise would have identity bound up in the pierce actions themselves, requiring some kind of signing to identify.  Then, correlation and replay of the user is hard.

? Should the user chain be in the browser, then interchained to the server ?

Modelling the user as a single chain, that the server relays things in to.

Client first generates a session chain.
