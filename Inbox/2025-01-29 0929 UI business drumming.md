Go to one particular company with a custom software model for them.

Then engage with them to get a system built, if they use it, they pay and we work out a price.

If they don't take it, go to their competitors with a similar system.

Basically if they don't pay us, we can go to their competitors with what we learned that they didn't pay for, and apply that.

A bit forceful, but we need pressure to pay the dreamcatcher, and we're saying anyone who takes our fair pricing will flourish, and those who don't, will fight against a business that has adopted fairness.

We should be the cheapest for highest quality, and in this rapid software world, all others using these tools will overcharge for short term advantage.

Set up a pipeline of these technical sales people, and feeding back into a pipeline to handle the hard bugs.
