If part of the mcapp definition was to list the children of a given toolset, then if we made the fetch able to retrieve that specially, and made mention of this structure, then the navigator can go find it.

Or we could just not mention it, and rely upon the search function to hit it ?

This would be like a 'links' field during a web crawl.

related or tags is used in npm packages to help find related packages.
