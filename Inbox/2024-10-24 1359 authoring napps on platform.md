How can we allow a napp to be written and executed live, in the platform ?

It needs a connection to a jsr module to be runnable as code.

So to run a napp, you would start a new branch, which might be blank, or might have a single file in it, then edit the napp file, and then install it on a branch, then send in actions to it.  Update the napp whenever changes occur.  The instructions for the napp can be dynamically edited too.

A blank branch can have files added and can then merge back in a single file, leaving the rest of the parent untouched.
