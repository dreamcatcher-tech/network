Make something we can run on a local always on machine that can do batch processing jobs.

So when uploading videos to youtube, it would allow them to host ourselves, by uploading the raw file, then processing into a more compact form, then deleting the file.

Then we can present our video catalog directly in band, rather than relying on youtube.
Use B2 storage to keep them present, and keep backups on local disk.
Perhaps cheaper to keep some cheap servers with big drives around that stores it all and makes available.
