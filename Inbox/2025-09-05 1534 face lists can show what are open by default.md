so like a status check, where you pass in an interaction id, and get back some progress update.
you don't have to create a face with a face kind, and some kinds, like status checks, might refuse to be created.

some faces are stateless, in that there is no ongoing operation.

so views are only really used by browsers ?they are not actions, they are resources that are viewed.

we should return from the creation what the status is, which might be done.  if not done then we can await for a certain state.

does list show running faces too ?
some might not allow interaction unless you started it ?
what about listing kinds only, which show which ones can be started, system ones, which anyone can use, and started faces along with their owners ?
