if you chaff out a ball of metre long nylon string, it will tangle the blades.

each little unit would be a tiny explosive with little weights on the end of a piece of nylon.  When it goes off, the nylon all explodes to go out in random directions.

other options are a net that gets shot out.  Doesn't need to be very heavy, so might sit inside shotgun shells.
