when we have multiple interactions on the go, the ability to call a function and get back the first interaction to complete helps a lot, as the system can keep responsive, instead of stalling on the slowest one, worst case.

definitely need some tooling for sending the same message to a bunch of faces, like a fan out command.

also need the same thing for agents, but this can be fun since the agents are intelligent, and so can be given open ended jobs to fan out with.
