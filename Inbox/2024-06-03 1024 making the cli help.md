Need a summary of all the isolate files.
Generate automatically ?
Make a little pipeline to output the descriptions based on the source code - gets regenerated if the hash of the description file changes.

API docs should be generated by bot based on some seed.  Then it should be regenerated based on usage, so we can see how it got used.  Detecting multiple steps can the cause to create a help, where the help allows a much quicker and shorter arrival at the right end result for the user.

Allows us to call any function into any pid with auto generated params.  Should be easier to use, but also means no extra interface required, saving construction time.  Plus shows how the model interprets out api docs.

This help is designed to invoke isolates raw, possibly with SU permissions.
