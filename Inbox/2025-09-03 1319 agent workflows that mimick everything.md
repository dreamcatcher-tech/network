all processes can be model as agents.

eg: in github, if there is a ghaction, and if that triggers another ai process to review the pull requests - these are all modelable using agents.

The issue with the current state is that these come from many different vendors, and different sovereighty realms.  We can do this all using agents.

So we would model one agent as the branch master, and it will ultimately approve or deny PRs, then it has project manager agents, that are set up in a pipeline / workflow.

There seems to be common layouts of teams, like PR agents vs program manages vs workers of various kinds, vs researchers and experimenters, then accountants and estimators that try to guess how much longer we have to go.

model using mango ql so we can sketch out complex charts with ease.

also we should be able to simulate or model using very light weight test simulators, before kicking off the heavy thing ?

But also if we have control over the whole thing, then we might as well just spin up the heavy thing, since what do we really care as its so cheap ?  speed of feedback during development helps immensely.

We might take some lessons from the actor model of computation, as this seems pretty much that ?
