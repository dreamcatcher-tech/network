The dreamcatcher account is the base place of your AI, and the connections to your data sources are managed here.  The goal of decentralized detachment is stated under this, with links to the packets we need to make this possible.  So our product always says what it aims to be, and links to the fundable tasks that make it happen.  In the UI you can turn this off just by asking for it, just like you can change everything.

We could install a small agent on the phone that handles linking accounts together, using other apps on the phone like google calendar, contact lists.  The mobile is the home of trusted secure data sources.

Its where you hold your billing arrangements, and your data access controls to the apps you have.  Apps then, are pieces of hard baked logic, and hard coded bots.  The next layer out is fuzzy, which is bots and services you use to get things done, like web pages.

It has a web based version, but to login with that, your phone app has to let you in.  Basically the mobile phone is the enclave of safe execution, so you must run the app there.  It also does signing of messages if some payment or transaction needs to go onto a public blockchain.
