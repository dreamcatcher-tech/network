the mcp is used to interact with the system ?

mcp offers a url to get access to the shell and start interacting ?

it just seems like shell offers a very natural fit for llm applications, particularly with the history, and the pure text thing, since that's all very natural.

so we can definitely capture the visible screen easily, and then we might include some direct actions by way of exposed mcp tools, or we could use the direct shell interaction mode.

realtime agent might be quite fast at doing all this.
