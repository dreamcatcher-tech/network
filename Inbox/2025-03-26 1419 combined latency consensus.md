If latency is one of the resources that you can buy in the marketplace, then we can also use it as part of the consensus mechanism, to ensure diversity and performance.

Each member would report the latency they are seeing on signed pings to other members, and publishing that table.  Everyone calculates what the effective latency map is, and uses this to guage how far away each of them are from everyone else.

The route maps include the network hops that were taken, so we can know when someone is setting up latency to make themselves look far from someone near.

It might not give us any extra strength tho.  Since an attacker could just put computers far away.
It is good for allocating jobs based on latench, for edge based responses to clients, for example.

Computers are special in that they compute the same no matter where they are.
