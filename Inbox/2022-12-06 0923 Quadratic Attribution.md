With [[Ambient Attribution]] the problem remains how to find what 'reasonable' is, in terms of attribution for contribution.

If a score is developed so that you are incentivized to find agreement with the majority, we can converge faster.  

Whatever you think it should be, you are punished by the square of the distance away from average, and rewarded by the square above average.  If you really believe strongly in something, you will take this stance and suffer the consequences, making your reward on future vindication greater also.

There is reward to be had for the people who changed a particular viewpoint.
