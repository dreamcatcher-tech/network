to expose this to the model using mcp tools, could be just taking a snapshot of the current screen view, and asking what text the model wants to put in to it.

we could get fancy and offer actual tui specific tool calls, but it might be sufficient as text.

?do we want to gamble that the model will become so good at shell operations that this is all it needs ?

should the stateboard be continuous, as in it is its own streaming feed ?
scroll can snap ?
