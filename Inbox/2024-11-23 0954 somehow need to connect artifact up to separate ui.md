If we could jack in to the vercel ai front end, then people could make their own interfaces that use artifact on the background ? We do not need to provide the full stack at launch, so long as we can quickly show our principles, and then build towards being standalone.

Then make widgets use react server components maybe ? or just plain react components packaged in the right way ?

RSC being dynamic is quite helpful tho, since lets bots select what to do ?

Need a nice clean way to connect the backing api, the auth, all to existing UIs, which means we can connect it to any UI.

Be nice to have the auth be purely in chain, so it is a separate system, and then the api calls just get wallet signatures to prove it is valid ?
