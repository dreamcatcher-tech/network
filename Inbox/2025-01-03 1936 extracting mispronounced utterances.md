Each mispronounciation could be isolated and snipped out, so we can train a model to detect these, and then know when they occured as a side model.

So this model would decorate the primary model and would know when a child is mis-speaking, so can flag the speech so it better understands babies.

This is a valuable dataset, since it will be hard to get later.
