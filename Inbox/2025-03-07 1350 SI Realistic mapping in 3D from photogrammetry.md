If we could be able to generate 3D images from simple cell phone camera videos or drone videos, then we can start to label each and every tree, each and every detail within the system. Then, each entity that is recognized can be arranged in a hierarchy and can be talked to and can participate in a group. For example, in the forest, you can talk to an individual tree, you can learn about all the characteristics of that particular species or of that particular tree on that island - things like growth rates, water consumption, etc.

This lets you do is you can now talk to the forest as an assembly of these entities and you can do statistical queries across every entity like "how much water do you need tomorrow? Do you see a shortfall in the next few years?" Each entity is able to do these accounting things and answer these plain English questions directly and factually themselves, and then they get rolled up to a higher entity that then reps and merges summarizes in a resultant what the final response of the group as a whole is to be.
