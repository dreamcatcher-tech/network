We would be a large repo that people could freely publish too. 
We would run automated checks, like opacity checks, source code quality checks, performance under certain situations.
The natural language gets checked for known AI exploits and fitness for purpose is considered.

We are basically curating the list - we make an uncurated list too, where anyone can publish, but that just means you can't be visible in our namespace and you can only share things privately.
Only open code can be published here, since it is going to get forked all to hell.
We should make our own license, to facilitate sharing quickly and rewards being enforced, as we all remix everyone elses prompting.  

Programs had hard boundaries - prompts not so much since it is much fuzzier.

Isolates should be provided with a way to automatically generate tests that get full coverage scores.

Separately from this is the namespace, where anyone run their own namespace - we reference everything by hash of content.
