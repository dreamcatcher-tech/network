They are using the same repeatability characteristics, but they use steps, and ask that you call their function system in steps like this.

Nice to see logs of what calls were made.

So each time we call an artifact function, we should allow a log so we can view the insides of the call, and replay, fork,  or otherwise analyze the function.

However this is simply a queue, it doesn't do the actual execution.  They're just defining step functions, but in a neat and approachable way.
