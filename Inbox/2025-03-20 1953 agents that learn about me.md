When I ask a question, I don't really want to treat each conversation like I just met the person for the first time; I kinda want it to know what I've been saying. I want to talk to the whole machine like it's a single person, much like how I expect to talk to a company as though it's a single person. It should know everything that it said previously, rather than just dumping it on the floor.

These types of systems would be really good in help call centers where handing a call over should come with some transcribed rapid information saying what's been going on, and it should highlight relevant information as soon as the person starts talking. The humans that are responding would sound super informed, super trustworthy, and always knowledgeable.
