we would switch it for the current session, then 

So need a tool that can edit help files, or at least can switch out the default help file.

Pulling from HAL should be automatic, done by commit hook on the github repo ?

Need some basic tooling to know what help is currently loaded, switch the current help, print the current help.

Can start with the ability to make a little bot, then run it.
