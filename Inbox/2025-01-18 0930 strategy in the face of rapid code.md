Generating code really fast and cheaply begs the question, what is the optimal thing to do.

Perhaps it is us that should go round cloning businesses that are making good money ?

If we make the clones quickly and push these starter companies onto dreamcatcher, then let others take them over and build, this gives us good income but also network effects.

We need some form of automated crawling system to assess what are the valuable things to be built.  Then if we can score the expected returns from each system, can calculate how much funds to allocate against it.

We need a system that calculates fair value for us, so we aren't just animals.
