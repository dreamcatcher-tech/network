By registering a DAO, we might be able to make a launchpad for any project that wants to start trading and engaging with legitimate entities, like banks.

Use the series llc structure to isolate things from no risk, low risk, then high value.
Once the liability goes over a certain amount, host on a dedicated series LLC.

The DAO would use legal representatives to ensure real world actions were taken by a reputable professional.

The DAO should be programmable to be one way - ie, its rules cannot be overturned once it is enacted.  Once it owns real world assets, those assets cannot be used in ways the DAO did not approve.

These launchpads would have built in compliance, and build in benefits modelling, so we can protect people from getting scammed.

This launchpad would be the home of the dreamcatcher.
Non profit, owns trademarks, controls revenue distributions of for profit entities.
