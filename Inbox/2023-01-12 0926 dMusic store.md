Arrange requests and ideas for the stores, projects, and the DAW

Store can be used to share your own private music collection of mp3s, and share them to others.

Work out how to do licensing where you can sell them to others and you get paid for transmission and archiving.

Store is for publishing consumable items, ready to use, no assembly required.  Can be used to request items not present, or request changes to published items.  Can auto publish to spotify or tidal or youtube or a range of other locations - so like hootsuite but for music publishing.
Components store is like npm, but for purchasing and requesting
Projects is what backs both stores.

distinction in the store is that you own the content that you purchase, and you can import your content from other sources.

System would work well for video editing, where the storage and rendering costs can be substantial, so an online DAW that can handle unlimited file sizes, can scrub quickly, can encode faster than a single computer, and that you can pool your company's computers into working could be good.

Locally cache by hash, pool your nearby peers as content providers, have a local server that auto crawls things you're working on.  Backups are easy and deduplicated.  Remote access is easy.  Shared collaborative editing by default.  Publishing to stores is integrated.  Plugin requesting and installation of peoples play / test plugins is easy.  Marketplace to get plugins tweaked or added for you is available.
