Then the merge back needs to show the reply contents that ended it, so we can trace what the threads are saying to each other.

The user is just a branch that inserts actions from goodness knows where.  
Visually, we are showing the actions that the user inserts, then showing what the bot inserts back.
When branching is triggered, we should the action that triggered the branch in the child branch, and also the replies in the child branch.  The bot in the parent branch may choose to say something extra on the main branch, which is then shown to the user.

In this way, the user is no different to any other NL actor.
