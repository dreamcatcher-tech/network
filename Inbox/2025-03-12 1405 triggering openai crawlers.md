We should be able to make some basic tools that will continue to take any content that you make and publish on the Dreamcatcher, and then ensure that that gets picked up by all manner of crawlers, including the OpenAI web crawlers. 

These tools should be able to do automatic SEO where they run some queries and see how the content compares and then work to ameliorate the content to fit the desired search results better. This could be sold as an agent tool to have constant live responsive SEO occurring.
