Making it automatically ok if a solution was submitted by the same person who made the header can turn it into a blog platform, where solutions are blog posts.

Bug bounty by reversing the packet so you hope it doesn't get solved and add increasing incentive.

Murdex integration somehow ?

crowdfunding delivery platform where QA represents some lifecycle hooks, so as each packet gets solved, then the individual deliverable NFTs are ticked forwards.

Making a crowdsourcing thing like kickstarter but representing contributions as NFTs.  Then these generative products continue to go on to be sold, and the royalties that are calculated in a decentralized way continue to get paid out to the initial contributors, at first using params set in the contract, and later by an AI.  If you pick odd parameters for your payouts, then others will not pay out to you cleanly.
