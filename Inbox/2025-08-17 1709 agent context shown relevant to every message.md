Each time the model runs, show graphically what was included in the context, and show what was flattened or excluded.

Lets you see from the models point of view.

give it a tool to browse the prior messages.

Might get given a summary of the current conversation anyway.

This would be a switch where you could see the prior turns as the model saw vs what you really put in.  Like a debug view so you can see the difference.

Better outputs come if the model is focused on a specific thing.
