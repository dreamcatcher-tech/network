as other people update these definitions, they change all the time.

To manage this, tests need to be put in place, otherwise the debate becomes correctness of definitions, whereas tests can be left in place and not changed ever.

The tests should be run, and then an output is shown to be wrong, and the definitions need correcting to pass these tests.

This would be running an eval.
