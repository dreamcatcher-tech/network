so if we start to get the bots to actually design ways to appraise the functions of a system, say a system to go and fetch insurance quotes, then it can determine good strategies, and can build some very good systems overall, particularly by watching user.

so long as we have a way to notify users about better deals, we can be shabby at first.
we can also offer to keep trying and keep watching out for them.

we could pay for all the tokens simply by the commission we would charge on setting up the deal.

if we go get a brokers license, then we can take the brokers commission as well.

We would watch user queries and see what areas need to be built out, and see what ones are getting good quality results.
