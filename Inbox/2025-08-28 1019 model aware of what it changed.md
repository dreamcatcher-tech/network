currently it looks at a repo with fresh eyes every time.

it should know, using git blame or other methods, what it has changed recently, so that it is self aware in that sense.

What that means is that it knows how to go and make changes if it was the one that made those changes in the first place.  But also it should value the human change, and it should store some commentary on why it thinks the human made that change, to help it understand and hold the intent.
