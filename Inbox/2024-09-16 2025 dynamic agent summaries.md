"what model was used in the last call ?"
bot that knows how to read and interpret the thread file, so can give that exact answer, by way of introspection.

"Hal play the song scorpio girls" - I would expect it to use a streaming serivce, or go out and download the song I want, and then check the song once downloaded so it could confirm the quality and the song being correct, then maybe fetch the lyrics and find a bunch of trivia.

A widget library, that shows visual representations of the widgets, and lets you zoom in on them, analyze a particular one.  The chat agent knows about the widgets so can answer questions about how to use it, and offers things like videos and other interations.

Files widget should be a single widget, that can be in different modes.
Each layer should be able to get out into the other layer, but only if the stateboard was configured to allow this.

Give each layer the ability to click up to the next one.

Select in the widget includes primary target, as well as additional focused items.
Editing of the item shows as the editing having occured.
The prompt allows deletion of the selected items.
When you change focus after having editing, we can add that to the prompt stack, so you can discard it if you want.
