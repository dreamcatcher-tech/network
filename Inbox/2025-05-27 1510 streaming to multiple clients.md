if several others want to listen in on a stream, like for chat responses, they should be able to get caught up on the stream.

so they would need to know the stream id, and be granted permission, then they can retrieve it and listen in.

else we have to make streaming be a totally separate layer, which is totally ephemeral.  as opposed to using our existing protocol, and making the actions be ephemeral.  so not committed to chain, which seems easier, and then we sometimes turn it on to commit.
