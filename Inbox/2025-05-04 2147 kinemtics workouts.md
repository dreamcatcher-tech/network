If we make a series, probably just two, of motors, then we can allow cable-like exercises to occur. We would have a camera watch the human and figure out the kinematic motion that the human is going through with the forces on the pulleys to figure out how much load is going on a muscle. We can give guidance on form and we can work towards goals for specific muscle groups. We can vary the weight of the resistance and we can shock or vibrate the resistance. 

Additionally, with those same motors, it might be possible to implement something like a rower or a bike or something as a means of dumping the energy. We could hook up another motor that would drive a fan at varying speeds. The fan would be driven with some extra energy from a capacitor so that the feedback was instant - it felt like you were connected as opposed to the lag and the sluggishness that can occur in pure magnetic couplings. The proportion of the energy burned is always less than humans putting in, but it's the instantaneous feedback that matters. At the same time, we can push back on the human provider artificial loads to any degree we want because we can now dump out through this fan or this other mechanism. We can be lifting off proportional amounts for batteries or all that. The key is the instant feedback.
