After diarization, and cleanup to condense the conversations down, we can then read it out load with different voices for each speaker.

this would be a widget on the stateboard, and you could twiddle which voices were applied to which speaker.

So you could hear the conversation, that was much more direct, as well as hear the actions the bot was going to take.
