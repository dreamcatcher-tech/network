Languages are hard to make and we haven't seen new ones in a while.

Using AI to reason thru the syntax might allow a new language to be made, and many dialects of it being possible, so long as the AI reasoners knew how to break it down.

Might be easier to generate training data for the language if it could iterated on, as in it can respond to a range of different inputs and give some reasonable response each time.

If it was built in to the AI as a way to think internally and natively, it might be deeper ?
