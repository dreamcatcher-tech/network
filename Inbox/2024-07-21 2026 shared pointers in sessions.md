Turning on pointer sharing should show where the mouse is for the other people, so they can scroll and see the mouse, select things for reference.

Possibly see the prompt of the peers at the same time, so know what they're typing or attaching.

Be able to select pieces of chat anyway, which can be added to the prompt as pieces of reference.

Then in multi user mode, this is shared and color coded.

If can see the other users prompt, then can see the attachments they are adding, which means you can scroll to see each one rapidly, or just be guided by the up and down arrows showing you where the view is.
