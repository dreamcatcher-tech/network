We should start with our own schema, and a set of rules for how to map from an xml document into our own schema.

We could use an ai mapping, or write some code to do the mapping automatically.

Then we run a looping function that goes over every single path and makes the changes, possibly in parallel.

The raw xml is not a great thing to parse.  We do need to map back out, as well.
