If HAL needs more info on a subject and it dispatches a help to work with the user to get thru the questions it wants answers to, then it could generate a function call definition which, when the help thinks it has enough info to answer, will fill in the template.

Calling the function would end the run and would give the caller the exact format they needed.

We need our platform to support experimentation of these kinds of things using only NL to configure them up, rather than intervention from a coder.
