the promise of multiple compatible hosts, including your own, means that we need a portion of the interface dedicated to managing this.

So you should talk to your current host probably in the billing section.

You should be able to add other hosts in at this point.

You could choose migrate, to move from one host to the other ?

or you can go on to the other host and pull in an account from another place, or from github.

ultimate is being able to run on several hosts simultaneously.
