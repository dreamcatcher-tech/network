If we have a structure that we are confident is strong, then we can raise and be committed to it.

Once artifact is stable, we can raise for the dreamcatcher, using the dreamcatcher mechnisms as the raise management.  If it stands atop artifact, and seeks to grow artifact, then the side effect is a super stable and reliable artifact platform.
