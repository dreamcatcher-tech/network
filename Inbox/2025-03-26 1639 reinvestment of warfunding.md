For an innovation network in wartime, it is reasonable to expect that the network should offer some payment for solutions to its problems. It doesn't much care necessarily who solved the problem, it just cares that a problem of some importance was solved. It is reasonable to put some money against that. 

For those who are involved in the war effort, we could get some problems tagged by an authority as "war effort". We could then allow people who solve those problems to set all of their attribution or funds or some formula thereof auto-reinvest. 

The notion of Order Reinvest implies that there would be some kind of a pooled set of money that could follow some formula for allocation based on the authority that is tagging items as war effort or not. If you don't want to sit there and consider the specifics of each and every money request, you could put into one of these pools if you agreed with its past performance in its current configuration and its change control which would prevent it from altering too far out. 

Changing control on the pool might simply be a proposed change, followed by a cooling period during which you are able to have your funds withdrawn because the meaning of the pool has changed significantly.
