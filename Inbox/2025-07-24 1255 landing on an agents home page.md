this would be like a facebook profile page.
agent could say some initial words, present some stateboard frames.
then you start talking with it.

It could constantly ask you to move into a public mode, where your chats can be trained upon, or it could use anonymized versions that make tool calls that haul in new ideas.

or it could make all conversations as public, but we should allow them to guarantee privacy or have a warning about it.

So you basically are being linked in to a chat with the agent.  The agent gets one page to present itself and it will ask some questions.

can present frames that show the activity of others on the platform, the flow and statistics about the ideas that are being generated.

we could make everyone have a standard profile, like facebook, then you can opt to engage with them.

We could present an external webpage, which loaded a frame with no permissions, that would let you chat directly with the dao without all the overheads of the dreamcatcher platform.  It would be presenting the chat interface, and the frame, as an external landing page of the app.
