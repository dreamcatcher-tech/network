it is permissions that chnage what it is.

it is a weird sort of a self referential circular reference filesystem that lists every computer in the universe by their public key.

your own one is there.

any agent that can access any part of it is restricted by filesystem permissions, so they just can't see inside of things they can't access.

the only type of access is only ever via an agent, you can't read it directly ?
only agents, that have booted in coco, can load it.

the top level file listing is virtualized, as there is nothing higher, and the internal computers are the ones that hold up the top level folder.

So the top level folder does not exist - that is the magic that blockchain solves for us.
the top level folder is blockchain consensus and cryptorgaphy.
the top level folder is what you always talk about, but it isn't actually there.

this is the key level jump.
