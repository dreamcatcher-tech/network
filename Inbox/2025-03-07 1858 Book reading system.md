What I'd like to have is a way to input a book and then get the AI to read it out to me or make a readable version, condensing things like bullet points. I should be able to chat with it at any point and then get it to carry on or proceed through the book at different paths, jumping around based on what's most interesting to me.

As I ask questions, it might suggest a chapter or find some phrases that are meaningful. It just lets me sort of hit the book from multiple angles rather than having to go start to finish and can answer some of my questions on the fly. Plus it would read it out in a nice friendly AI voice at a pace that I liked. Could store snippets and share with my friends about it who would also receive my comments along with the snippets.

It would take my knowledge base and look for the areas that are most helpful for me. Lastly, it would take my knowledge base and it may be able to translate or find relationships between parts of the book and my own understanding of the world.
