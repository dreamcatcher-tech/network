with the ai doing the negotiation, we can handle jobs that are spotty, vague.
ai makes sure nobody is wasting your time either, as it can defend both sides, as well as philosophical base things like how much should anyone get paid in the first place ?

lets you haggle with the workers, and can place bids for jobs that are low priority but cheap, so if you don't have money you can be more accomodating.

use smart glasses the people wear so we always have backup on what they're doing, and easy quoting, and records go to the ai so it can figure out more stuff for you.

goes into your app so you can give instructions to the app.

beats having to tell a human since people don't like bossing other humans around.

its like a super polite broker between people.
