Give the customer a tool that lets them annotate the responses that have come back. 
So in the stateboard their prompts are passed in, then HAL asks them questions about that response which gets stored.

These can be fed straight into the prompt as a quick patch fix, then we can distill it down to a set of rules that get run in testing - global rules vs local rules - or we could run them each prompt as a reflection back on the suitability of the response.

Global rules can be set per path in the filesystem, or some other narrowing scope.

Should be able to automate the discussions with this person about what was wrong with the response.
