if we have enough platform intelligence to map out the path we are currently on, and keep adapting it as knowledge comes in, ai upgrades, environment changes, new ideas etc, then this is the smartest possible thing we could do.  The smartest thing to do is let the ai govern what we should do next.

if we start with just selling hosting services, and jobbing platform for purchasing services, then we gain a foothold, and can build on that.

so we have the series system for our own endeavours, and we have some revenue generating operations of our own, then we work towards decentralized versions.

i would like to support / donate / gift this money in appreciation for this particular contribution, or groups of contributions, that you have made, and I expect no returns from you or any other person for doing so.  there is no legal obligation for me to receive any future recognition for this, but there is a social expectation if have to be rewarded fairly.

Buying it outright means you could get sold a dud.

so if we separate the decentralized attribution system, and make it clear that further payments are in no way guaranteed, promised, or otherwise, then we should be clear ?

as a general rule, being local resident is probably going to give us the best deal in terms of regulation in each place, and if we can keep up with that automatically, we can sell that service to others, since we are api'ing the institutions.
