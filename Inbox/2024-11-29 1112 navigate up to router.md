Every agent should know how to handle out of band questions.

It should provide a button it can click on to go to the router, or it can offer some suggested options that came in from the router, or you can tell it you want to go, or you can move on.

So it lets people switch agents within a chat.

The agent is a way of indicating what your focus is ?
If you need something more general, then you should use a top level agent like a router, which can use any other agent, including agent discovery.
