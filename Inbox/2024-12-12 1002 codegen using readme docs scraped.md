Same as pointing a bot at a docs link to pull down the readme file of a repo.
These libs would have their readme's synced in to the repo, which are used as source material for the prompt to build the code from.

This means that the bot is told how to use different pieces of code, so the results get better.

When you find a new library, using a single tool, you should be able to load that github url in the manifest / registry of code, and then another tool will download the readme.  The registry says where the code is located, and notes other files of interest, but defaults to README.md.

This tool is permanently useful, since going forwards, to make code, this is the strategy we would pursue.
