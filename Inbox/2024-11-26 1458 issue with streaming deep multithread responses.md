Firstly, this can flood the client.

Secondly, these responses are typically meant to be less creative, since the further away from the origin the intelligence moves, the less oversight and so the less freedoms it should have.

Also the multithread nature means we are no longer on the same ram that called the origin, which makes it complex to communicate back.

So for bulk calculations on artifact, we can stream back with completion being the boundary, but for the UI people need the intelligent bot streaming back directly.
