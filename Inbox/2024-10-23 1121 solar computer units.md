BH suggested selling a unit that was a solar panel bundled with a computer, that did shared computation for you while the sun was shining, earning you revenue but also earning credits to run on other peoples computers on the other side of the world.

The self contained nature means no overhead for install.  No maintenance.

Panels could collect water which it can use for evaporative cooling.  Computer sits in a sealed water bath, and boils the water as its cooling mechanism.  The copsensation can be caught on the back of the panel, which can be used as purified water.

If you have a few of these units placed around, you can effectively compute for free.  The equivalent of a datacentre could be built with these things, and the cost would be fractional.  Plus they are naturally edge devices.
