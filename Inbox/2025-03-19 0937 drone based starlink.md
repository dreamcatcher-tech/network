For the price of the satellites, including the launches, and the global reach required (launching enough for a small area is also enough to cover half the world) it might be cheaper to have a network of drones maintaining connections ?

Especially if the network was designed so that every participant was active, and relayed information on.

If the apps were designed to be intermittent then loss of connection need not be fatal either.

Apps should have a queue that they can alter, so they can change the order of the buffered items so whenever any glimpse of comms occurs the most important goes up first.

Could use directional lasers to ensure point comms to different units.

Ideally each machine could think for itself to some degree, so no need to feed back to base constantly.
