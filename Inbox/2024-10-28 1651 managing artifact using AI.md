The packages of artifact should be able to be parsed and modelled using AI and some minor software tools.

We should be able to well define the interfaces, and ensure diagrams are kept up to date, so the whole system is coherently explainable.

These docs would serve as starting point if we disconnected the AI.

The spec doc should be the thing that gets changed first before any changes in code.

The protocols of the various layers should be spec'd and tested to be logically isolated.

jsonfunction layer vs blockchain execution vs api gateway.
