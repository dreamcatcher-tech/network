 I would like to be able to have a group chat either collection of agents there will be one background agent which is the orchestrator the hands out the talking stick and as I said each agent takes its own unique approach to solving a particular thing - one by web search one by logical reasoning they might use different models and so all of these bots are coming up with a response that is a parallel.
 
  The orchestrator decides which one to choose as the response for me additionally agents who are not specialist and the topic of conversation that would be avoided from running to not pass on them said we know it would be wrong.
