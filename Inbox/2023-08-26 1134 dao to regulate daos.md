Like the CRICOs idea, we could make a network of soulbound members, who model ico and business proposals of all kinds, not just crypto, and then take a cut of the upside if you follow their advice.  They could provide some amount of insurance against bad deals, and for this cover you pay a fee.

To get assessed by them costs a fee too.

Could have our own regulator murdex, where the roundtable votes if something is a scam or not, and then ddos or other types of suppression mechanism opens for funding.

Regulators.  Regulate any scamming of crypto property.
