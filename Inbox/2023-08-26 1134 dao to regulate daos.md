Like the CRICOs idea, we could make a network of soulbound members, who model ico and business proposals of all kinds, not just crypto, and then take a cut of the upside if you follow their advice.  They could provide some amount of insurance against bad deals, and for this cover you pay a fee.

To get assessed by them costs a fee too.

Could have our own regulator murdex, where the roundtable votes if something is a scam or not, and then ddos or other types of suppression mechanism opens for funding.

Regulators.  Regulate any scamming of crypto property.

So rather than each project having to set up a DAO, we have projects inside a master DAO, where the rules of the master DAO are enforced at shared cost to all, and some fundamental principles are adhered to, such as compliance.
