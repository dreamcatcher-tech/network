If we got to the point where a well reasoned spec could be published, and then turned into an NFT, then the work can be undertaken against these units, and the diffs reviewed by either our tools or other review tools.

Hopefully all the other tools cannot survive in an environment where they do not control the users data.

As hosting becomes easier and easier, and coding too, everyone becomes a coder.

The new facebook is something that can publish a standard form of an AI agent, like an AI entry point, where everyone can message your personal bot, and it can act on your behalf.

"hit me on facebook" becomes "talk to my agent" - then all comms are proxied thru this platform.
