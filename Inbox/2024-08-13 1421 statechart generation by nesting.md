If the interface for what a particular state needs to do is cleanly defined, then we can work on the internal state in isolation, greatly increasing the chance that we will get that right.

Means we can test it independently.

Start with an NL description of what the piece does, and then build it out from that description.

The description is the primary thing to get accurate, since everything else is derived from it.  The bots have nothing else to go on.
