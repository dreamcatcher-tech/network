Track the state within a git branch.
Trigger using a deno isolate, then use that to fire up a deeper lambda function.
Then feed the results back into deno via an isolate.

Should be able to run the dneo code, along with compartments, to have all the features of a deno isolate, but with heavier CPU and a longer running thread.

Principle could be extended to do execution management using any kind of api or platform.
