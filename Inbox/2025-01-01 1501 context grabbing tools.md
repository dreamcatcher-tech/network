This seems to be the whole key.

So have a tool that you can browse pages, and then click our extension to include parts of the page in as context.

If you are logged in, we can select the last open chat, some specific recent chat, or just in the paste bin.

These snippets can be shared with other people so they can all see what you saw, and so they can browse and upload their version of what they saw too.

> Teleporting the current browser session or selection

Make a widget that can be linked to the current page you're browsing, so that you can see it in the context of the chat.

The LLM might be able to send back clicks, or fill in forms for you too.

Also allows easy sharing of a webpage in a group chat, if you hook up this extension, and it just streams the whole dom into the chat.  It can be snapshotted at a certain point, so there are clear references going back in time.

Others can open this dom in the real browser, or they can open the URL too.

When the team is viewing the same url, then their mouse pointers are visible in the main widget as well.  They can open in readonly.
