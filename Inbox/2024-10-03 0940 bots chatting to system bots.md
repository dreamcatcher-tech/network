If the CRM was a plain language interface, then we have presentation layer bots that generate instructions for the drones ?

Is this better than having functions get called ?

By reading a list of NL instructions, the bot can select which ones it wants to use, and indicate its intent, and then go back and forth with the system bots to get the outcome it wants.  This is better than the strict function call structure, as it leverages 2 layers of intelligence, which avoids having code being written.
