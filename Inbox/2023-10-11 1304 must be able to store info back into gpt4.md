If it helps me with something, then I find out how to do it better, then I should be able to program it and say "next time, do this".  This should be able to be shared amongst trusted people in a decentralized way.

When instructed like this, gpt should produce a snippet that makes this piece of knowledge optimally retrievable at time of need, using the embeddings.  This might be what embeddings does already tho ?  We could see if the performance was different between these methods.

If we ask the text to be converted to embedding format, it can greatly reduce the token size of the embedding, so seems worthwhile to make the function call.
