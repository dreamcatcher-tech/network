we could burn a leaderboard level amount of tokens for about $500 for gpt-oss-120b.

If we start doing some big runs, and use openrouter, at least we get some publicity for our runs.

As our app grows, maybe this will be organic.

for cheap models like oss, it could be $50 worth with a slow provider that was dirt cheap.
