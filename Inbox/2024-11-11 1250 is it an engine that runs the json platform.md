That is is our blockchain or not should only depend on the napp, now the execution environment.

A host would be simply something that starts up, and holds a particular napp upon it.

? how would new napps be added in ?

So to start running a napp, we would pass it in a napp, and let it start up ?

But the thing that holds the napps and the db connections seems different ?

The cradle should pull in the db connections, shockwave as the scaler, git as the snapshot provider.

Then it is also given a napp to start running, as tho that is the installed thing.

Is execution an interface, or is it dependent on the objects we pass in ?

What the engine does is to ensure persistent running of a napp, whereas a compartment does simple running.

Compartment runs a single thread to exhaustion, but the transmissions are also required to keep the whole system moving forwards.

Compartment takes a trail, then executes a napps functions.

It should boot, then be injected with something that seals it and reserves its usage for only the root user.

The server is an auth wrapper around the engine which is running.  Server can use the engine to store is auth information, but it just provides a way to access that from outside chainland.

The browser could be made to be a remote host, and just connect in this way, but seems better as a thin host since less complication.

## Using the trail as a way of tracking promise state and controlling execution
Only thing wrong with it, is the compartment's attachment to it as a signalling system.
