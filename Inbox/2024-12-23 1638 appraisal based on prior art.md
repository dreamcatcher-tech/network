if we have a collection of napps that we have approved, then we would make individual calls that gets o1 to compare the new one vs each of the old ones in turn.

As output, it would say what is defective about the new one, and provide quotes from the exemplary one to be used to correct it.

These would get combined into one, and the next version of the new one would be produced, which should ratify it with how the rest of the napps look, maintaining standard by sort of defacto example / overwhelming example.
