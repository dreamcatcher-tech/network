Run the tests in switchboard, so we can take them as tho they were just put in on the prompt.  Then assert that switchboard detected the correct agent to choose.

So need to assert which agents got chosen by switchboard, as a way of testing the whole system e2e.

Perhaps an agent needs to register a speciality so the switchboard knows to choose it.
