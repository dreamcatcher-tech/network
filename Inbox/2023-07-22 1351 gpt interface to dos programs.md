Because we have the description of all actions, we should be able to make a gpt interface that can call functions in our system.


We have forking which can let the ai test its theoretical plans and compare to the required outcome, then try again.  These would look fun to watch happen in realtime.
Might be able to describe a goal, and then have the ai grind its way towards it, trying to do different things.
The program as a whole could be treated like this, and the so the ai would become more and more adept at using it, as it watched other humans using it, and as it tried its own actions out in the dojo.  Conventional apps do not have this rollforwards and back ability, and so their ability to present a continuous dojo to the AI is not there.

The commonality between many different apps and their dojos should lead to an AI that has a base understanding of the most likely way that it should do things.

Present multiple paths that the AI found to the human for some overall help - human knows what it wants better than the AI, so once the AI finds things that look close enough, human can intervene.

The ultimate is if the AI could detect where a new feature should be applied.  AI would then change the default presented version of the app to reflect what it found was hard and what it learned about what people wanted.  It would also help people craft unique versions of the interface to suit their individual needs better.  Ultimate is that it can write and test its own covenants to do things that the app couldn't do before.

We should be able to demonstrate what a blockchain backed AI can do, along with all these niceities, and make the case for why we need a good solid blockchain based ai framework that runs in the way we say, without these central tokens, and possibly with an internal bridging currency that wraps everything else.  At the very least we can show why you would get paid if you spent your efforts working on our system, rather than investing money or time in any other system.
