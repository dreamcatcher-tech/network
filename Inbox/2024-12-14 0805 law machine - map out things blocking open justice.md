We should be able to reason thru where parts of the system block open access to things, allowing people to hide, and we should find ways to head those off.

The reasoners have higher intelligence than any human ever had, including judges, and so we should be able to illuminate the legal system and its weaknesses.

The key is being able to find friends in the quagmire - to be able to, using the AI, find people with a similar situation, for the sake of commradery and even financial support, sharing the burdens.

Would be great to build an open AI searchable database, and then also offer a marketplace for legal services where our data platform is the common element for all the professionals to use and the data to reside on, boltered by native AI services.

any time multiple professional services need to coordinate, a platform like ours should exist - the person paying should force all data to go thru this platform, and the platform offers good switchability between services, and good quality checks on the services provided.

The ideal service economy is what everyone wants and says they offer, but in practice they always engage in unhealthy practice that is selfish, and so we offer a platform that enforces fair play for all.

Commentary on the case law and on pending outcomes can be AI generated, and then tweaked by a human, where everyone gets paid for this contribution, and people can stake against it and get paid when someone pays to be insured about that.

Monetizing the difference between sounds right and guranteed to be right.  

AI can make anything sound right, but what backs that up ?

the database would need to be deep linked between all relevant info.  A crawler would then walk thru these things taking a close look at the relationship to the question and keeping notes.  These crawls could be stored and made available too, if you want a discount, since we can redact the question.

Maybe make friends between people searching for the same anonymized thing.
If the search was public but who was private, this could be good to watch ? see how many people are querying right now ?  Reading the access of a crawl costs you some of the crawl cost, so if you do good crawls, you can get paid a lot.

Make it like the wikipedia of law, where people can run their own crawls, and grind agents thru improving the current best thinking offered by the platform.

Use the judicial practice notes to know about the operation of the law, such as timelines, costs, requirements to turn up in person, what the other party might do, etc.  We can use this to law out a project plan and a timeline, so people have more of an idea what's going on.

We can take academic journals of law as a source of novelty to try to interpret the laws in novel ways, and give some ranking scores as to how well a certain approach might work.

Start with describing the scenario in detail, and then have the machines grind to find angles of attack.  Once a suitable attack vector is determined, costing, timings, and damage to the other side is calculated.  The funds required can be sought publicly, or amongst a syndicate.  The act of raising can be made public in some cases, or at least synonymous, which can cause fear in the enemy, particularly if they know it is something the public would jump on.

? make a syndicate the funds actions in court in exchange for a portion of the fees, which it uses to fund more activity.

Keep greivances up dated with changes to laws that are proposed or otherwise, and look for new attack vectors all the time as things change.
Indicate which MPs and parties would have a better outcome for you case.

Theorize about new info that would be useful to glean.  Thoroughly cross check scenarios and figure out what parts to push on.

Benefit is that we can operate across multiple laws and multiple disciplines, which often a single lawyer is not able to do.
