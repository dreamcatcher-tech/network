Issue is that two values in the system each have the same CID, which causes the cache to return the wrong class.

The fatal assumption is that the CID is always the same class.

We have a pathing issue, where things with different classes can have the same CID, particularly when blank or when there are some optional

Can either seed a small key to ensure difference, or make resolver requests be context aware, where the cache also stores the classes of things.

Or, detect when these issues occur, and then do a cast to get back the class we want if there has been a collision.

How can these types of bugs be made easier to trace down ?
Being able to snapshot the engine and rerun it on the exact conditions that it was primed with would help.
