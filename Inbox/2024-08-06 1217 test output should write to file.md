These things can be huge, so we might want to write direct to file, and read in what we want ?

to read large numbers of tests, we can call a summarizer / aggregator that would summarize what happened in large numbers of tests ?

The test output file would mimick the input file, but would be strictly formatted, and would include the results within it.

Naming should be the same as the test spec itself, and it just overwrites it, and can use git to recover it.

Runs would not be saved upwards unless we explicitly said ?
