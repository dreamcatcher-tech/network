Run in a browser as soon as the first realistic 3D-aware generative model tools come on the scene. Be there, ready to provide the service. Hook up in the backend to multiple print providers as well as local cells and your own machine which you can add to the cells cloud level slicing and optimization. Provide finite element analysis in the cloud delivered from a browser. Synchronize across all your machines, upload camera feeds, analyze the print gear warnings, and have it be entirely plugin-based. Pull in open-source components from other slicers. Allow people to make their own tools very easily. Taking parts and modifying them should be trivial. Collaborating and having many different versions, real-world feedback, real-world data, sensor information should all flow back.
