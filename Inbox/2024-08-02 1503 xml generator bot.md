To generate fake data for testing the crm import, we need an xml import, and then some instructions on how to generate the fake data.

We would want to check the xml against a schema checker to ensure it is correct somehow ?

We should be able to firstly generate a pseudo template as a starter, and then have some rules describing how we want the data done.

Then we should be able to ask for different amounts of different addresses, and get them generated by 4o-mini, up to the context window size.

We would run this bot in a test that was NL only, and we would give it the base template, then when we tweak the rules of the bot, we would examine the output.  
Then we have a generator that can generate arbitrary data in bulk.

run it with an amplifier, so it runs the same function n times, as opposed to making it loop over the files specified in a glob.

We would stub this in place of the bot that syncs with moneyworks directly.
