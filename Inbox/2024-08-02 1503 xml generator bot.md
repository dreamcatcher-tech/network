To generate fake data for testing the crm import, we need an xml import, and then some instructions on how to generate the fake data.

We would want to check the xml against a schema checker to ensure it is correct somehow ?

We should be able to firstly generate a pseudo template as a starter, and then have some rules describing how we want the data done.

Then we should be able to ask for different amounts of different addresses, and get them generated by 4o-mini, up to the context window size.
