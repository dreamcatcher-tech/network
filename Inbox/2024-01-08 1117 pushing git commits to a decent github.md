Can make it easy to host existing git repos.  Can distribute them widely.  Can do private ones where you hold the servers, or you pay for trusted private servers.  Or just pure public where availability is more important.

This is just treated as a dumb host - no execution is done for it.

This could be added as a hook to an existing git install, rather than a dedicated client that we have to maintain and distribute.

Git is the protocol of consensus for code.
