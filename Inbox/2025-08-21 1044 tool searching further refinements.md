if, when we load tools, it unloads the search function, except for one tool, named escape, then it stops the confusion between tools.

then we can also skip the name sanitization ?
loading multiple toolsets at once seems wierd ?

having the search functions in there along with the regular tools confounds things.

in search mode or in tool mode.

Prompting is about having clear purpose with the tools more than just strong language.
