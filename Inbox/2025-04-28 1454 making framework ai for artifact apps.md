we should make a platform where people vibecode napps that do infrastructure things, thru rigorous testing, designing, and formal modelling.

Then our framework, being ai native, can be a very easy thing for people to get productive work done in.  Just might cost a lot of tokens.

Also if it is immediately deployable, and bug finding involves ability to replay exactly what happened, and an agent can drive that, and go thru many scenarios, fix your problem, and possibly contribute back to the overall system, that is a far better experience for everyone, and requires far less skill than even vibe coding, since vibe still has to deploy, and still has issues when scaling and security concerns, infrastructure debugging is hard.  Really hard.  So hard there are whole industries set up to handle this.

We should pay for tokens that find fault in our systems.
