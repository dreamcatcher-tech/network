if we struggle to get repeatable model execution in a given model that has other desirable features, then we can run different versions multiple times in a monte carlo fashion, until some threshold is reached, where the threshold is a tool call being made with certain parameters.

So if we can't get something repeatable, then we can run it enough to have assurance.
