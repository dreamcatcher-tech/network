If we put a camera watching the couches or the room, then we periodically take a snapshot when we think that some animal has entered the room or has got on the furniture, then we emit a short high pitched burst to get them to leave.

The idea is that as soon as they jump up, 

This could be two stage, where we have general detection of an animal in the room, which toggles vigiliance mode where we wait for the exact moment they jump on the couch, so that the noise is related to their action, so their training begins.

Recognize which animal, and have a chart showing their progress towards training to not use that device.

Can link to vibration or movement on the couch, for that instant feedback.  Camera arms the system when there are no humans in the room, and disarms when humans are found.  Make the sound come from inside the couch, so it is even closer related to the couch.

Map the whole house so we can track the movements of people beyond just the single room.

Be interesting if it caused the animal to stop using all couches, not just the alarmed ones.
