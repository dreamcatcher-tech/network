With a very small agent running as a service on a desktop, we should be able to bind hotkeys and connect directly to the platform, so that all the text and all the sound is captured independently, stamped, verified, trained upon, re-grounded, added to context, and pasted into apps. Or it could just be used as a general note-taking device. 

Whenever there is an error, we should be able to talk about it and have the phenotype be ground over to make sure that it gets picked up correctly. They should also have access to our current running context and whatever we are trying to do, giving it a better chance of either getting it right first time or getting it right within successive passes.
