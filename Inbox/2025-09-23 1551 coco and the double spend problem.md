digital ledge currencies are annoying because you need to be in contact with the ledger to make a payment.

but in cocoland, you could sign something and have it move a signed thing around, and then possession becomes the thing.

also, coco compute receipts can be used as currency, as in, you did these things, and so you can spend them, or sell them.

you might have even computed in secret, but the receipts would still be valid.

so a little 'wallet app' that did signing of your payments for you, that you could know did not double spend, and the signature was rooted in the coco, somehow, so you can treat it like something you can go and spend.

if the primary chain ensured no rollback of state, then any coco that was started could make their payment signatures and you could trust them without checking back with the chain.

the idea is, if we can enable decentralized lightweight spending with confidentiality, we can have very high tx thruput and micropayments.

the double spend problem becomes the double boot problem.  so long as there were no two cocos booted with the same keys at the same time, you can trust it.
