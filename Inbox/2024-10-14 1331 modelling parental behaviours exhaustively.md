o1, give me an exhaustive list of all the known effective forms of disciplining and nurturing children, by reinforcing good behaviours and dis-enforcing (or whatever the word is) bad behaviours.  I want it as a logical list, formed of components, such as negative reinforcement, positive reinforcment - I am looking for pure truth table style classifications because I want to make a component model so I can analyze combinations of different patterns using algebra.  

The purpose is to make little diagrams that show how any scene in parenting can be depicted as an arragement of all these components.  Sometimes they need to be sequential to describe the scene.  The purpose is to show how all behaviours fit this model, and how some kinds of behaviours, repeated often, can lead to negative outcomes for the children.

The idea is that parents all agree on the long term outcomes they don't want for this children, and so we need to help them see how their short term behaviour needs to change.

Link me to any studies you know about this stuff.



The idea is to express all interations as a kind of graph notation.  We would indicate negative behaviour and then show the reaction from one parent, then insert possible behaviours from the other parent, or those around.

Show how the behaviour is different in a group.

Show interactions at school, based on when we model trauma behaviours at one home, then the kid comes to school and does something else.

Also give people the language to describe the behaviour they are experiencing.  Like negative trauma, fright, natural consequences, etc.

If we can set ratios of different kinds of behaviour, then we should be able to predict chances of negative outcomes.

An AI school where the students are also being data sampled and the data is shared respectfully, so we encourage more rapid study.

So we should be able to model global effects like allowing oneself to repeat, not following thru - these are all signal degradation.  So different patterns with different levels of signal degradation will have different outcomes.

Then we can run simulations and map these back to studies - hopefully the outcomes make common sense ?
