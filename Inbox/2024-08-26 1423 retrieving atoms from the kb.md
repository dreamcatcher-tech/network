If you start speaking about things you want your response to look like, then we can pull up atoms that we think are relevant, which you can confirm, and so the response will be crafted using the atoms of the system rather than whatever you input.  Gives it an instant boost in clarity and correctness.

Then allow us to provide links to the atoms in the appendix to the email.
