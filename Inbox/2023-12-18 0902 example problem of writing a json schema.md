This is an example of a function that will make some AI calls and then also has a UI element to display that can be called on as a component in a jitter.

## The problem
If I have several object instances and I want to form a json schema out of them then I don't want a program that does that, I want an intelligence.

So in this way the AI may need to ask a few more questions of the data and it makes it act like a form in an app that gets filled in.  This step can be translated or modified but ultimately the app should be provided in a way where it could provide the AI and has been tested with some particular model and set of config, or it could be driven as just simply artifact calls into it, so that the consumers can ask the AI questions of the user in any way they like.
