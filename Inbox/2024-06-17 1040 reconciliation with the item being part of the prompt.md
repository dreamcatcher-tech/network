We can chat about a certain gas trade.

This would need some kind of schema that it can look at or reference, and then we can negotiate with multiple parties about what the best reconciliation of this is.

So the git history of this item is viewable by all.

The consensus can be shown in colors too, where people can commit depending on other things, when something else has happened.

We should be able to model all possible reconciliation scenarios using git language, and the consensus is just having multiple parties agree to the changes.  Possibly staged followed by a final step so they can have complex dependencies and can change at some later point before being fully committed.

Induct people not using the portal by drafting and processing emails with them the traditional way, and including those emails into the branch about that specific trade.

Allow people to run their own AIs to drive the system, or just do it entirely manually.
