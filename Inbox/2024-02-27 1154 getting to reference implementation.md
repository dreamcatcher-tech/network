Trying to make a protocol for permanent computation records, and develop the tooling and use cases around that.

How it gets implemented in the future should be across many different systems, in many different ways.

The protocol should be well defined in natural language.  Proposals need integration with the natural language logic checkers first.

Implementations are checked automatically against these implementations, since the bare basics of the interface is json in, so we can use NL generator suites to exercise.

Plus we should have usage of other large apps.
