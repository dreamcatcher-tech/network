If we have effectively remote sessions running, and then we have web browsers that connect in to an artifact services that is running these remote desktops, so that they can be driven by AI, then we can still have access to existing apps, but enable it in a hybrid way.

Basically we can start to learn how very complex closed apps work, but still have AI powered agents on premise.

So even if a company has all its data stuck in these apps, and can't move over to AI immediately, they can start working with it via this operator interface, so even legacy apps can start to receive automation.

Then we can focus on the data behind it, and start to lift that off.

Start with email, if we can intercept the email flows, we can intercept the rest of the business.
