First is pure text, realtime transcription, showing conversations occurring in a channel.

Then we have a condensed version where the best version of what the person is saying, drawing on our full knowledge base, is shown, linearly, sometimes as a combination of mutliple people.

Lastly, sequence is removed, and the reconciled versions with the knowledge base are displayed, so order of change is still last changed, but if the speakers were oscillation around topics rapidly, then this is a stable view of just the big things that changed, so de-jittered.

It does to the knowledge content what the realtime transcription does to the speech audio - updates its prediction as more becomes available.
