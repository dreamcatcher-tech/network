tornado has a great algo for mixing assets or any kind of ledger changes.

we could build this in, and implement in our language of choice, then make it quite efficient to make payment channel style payments but with this mixer guarantee, making it impossible to see who is communicating with who.

we could make it simpler by just doing payments separately to consumption, so the two cannot be correlated.
