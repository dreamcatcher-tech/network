Make a services app that lets you manage any kind of service from an API.
Place the collections service in there.
Better than having an app dedicated to just them, since that is expensive to maintain.
Have services that can coordinate other services.
API tracks time on site, hours logged, billing, payment processing.

Every company would prefer to have an app to manage their customers, but few small companies can afford to do that.
Like Ubereats, but for everything.

If we convert services to be in our store, then we get to take a cut of their sales.
