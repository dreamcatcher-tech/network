If we register an ethereum smart contract that is controlled by a Dreamcatcher instance, then we can start using our systems as governance systems, and can allow a banking rail to enter the dreamcatcher.

Start a minimal KYC service using the dreamcatcher to control issuance of soulbound tokens.

Make a safeguard delay of 7 days, where the veto controller can only stop things happening - can't actually do things - until we are safe they system is secured.

Batch agreement by a human, where everything is denied by default, but one tick allows everything queued up to proceed.
