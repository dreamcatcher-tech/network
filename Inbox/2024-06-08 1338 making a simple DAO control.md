If we register an ethereum smart contract that is controlled by a Dreamcatcher instance, then we can start using our systems as governance systems, and can allow a banking rail to enter the dreamcatcher.

Start a minimal KYC service using the dreamcatcher to control issuance of soulbound tokens.

Make a safeguard delay of 7 days, where the veto controller can only stop things happening - can't actually do things - until we are safe they system is secured.

Batch agreement by a human, where everything is denied by default, but one tick allows everything queued up to proceed.

If we registered the dreamcatcher DAO, then we might not need a public company, if the token gets listed on an exchange ?
If we were sufficiently decentralized, then the NFTs we hold can be resold, or a loan taken out against them.  The token could be a pool representing a bunch of the NFTs, and that token can be completely decentralized.  The DAO could do purchasing of the NFTs it liked ?  Or it could function as an index fund, where say 20% of every NFT remains tradeable in the fund, to increase the currency value ?
