building the framing protocol:
- mock artifact, and have two html pages served in vite

building frames themselves:
- provide a static page that can be configured as a harness, or use the artifact platform itself to display the frame.  
- on our platform, we could snapshot a location to test with ?
- static page that can be used to help dev



need a harness that can mock artifact responses ?
