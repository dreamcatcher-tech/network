Best short term option is a cors proxy.

Might make a dir snapshot to give the first load from a binary asset, rather than requests out ?

Or, mount the remote repo inside of a virtual generated first repo.

Helps could be mounted by backing files for fast load.

If the goal is to get a github login, so we can have write access to a repo, then setting up a callback for github auth seems best option.

Or we could just set up a private git server, with no permissions ?

So because we are running a cors proxy for deno, we might as well store the auth info on deno too ?
The client would generate a secret, send it to our server, then do the github redirect, then go to our deno auth site, then the client keeps the secret as its auth with our server.  So when it makes requests via the api, or when it uses the cors proxy, it uses this random seed as its authentication to use the users api key that we store only on the server.
