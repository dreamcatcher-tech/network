? Do small runs in a test environment ?
? replay the test environment as a chain somehow ?
? how do we know if we have received a complete Pulse or not ?
? How to know where the sync stalled ?
? Is lifter transmitting completely and correctly ?
? How to see inside the lifter protocol, to trace down if it did a complete sync correctly ?
? did the syncer get asked to lift with a truly fully walked prior ?

## Problem
Cannot recreate the sync in a test run, so cannot tune performance effectively.
