One of the big issues, particularly with Ompro, is that I might start reading the file that it outputs, detect a problem, and then start it running to fix that problem. During the time that it's doing its solving, I've read more of the file and now I found some other errors that I want to add, but I can't interrupt it, so I have to wait for these other things.

In a system that was running multiple parallel paths swarming around like a soup as it hunted for the answer, adding in extra information like this should be able to just insert it in preferably in a way where it wouldn't have mattered if it had all that information at the start or it got it later because it should have followed the process of breaking down the request anyway.
