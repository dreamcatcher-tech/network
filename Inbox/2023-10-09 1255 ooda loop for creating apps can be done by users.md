flow for improving an app goes like:
1. use app
2. recognize output is not what you wanted
3. file bug 
4. implement change (usually this is dev)
5. loop internally until output from same output is as expected in the ticket
6. present back to user to confirm output is now as expected.

This can now be done in app, by the user.
