being pure hash based means we can make lambda functions that are able to sync super rapidly since they are just requesting hashes of the swarm.

so the work tree only ever exists in the ram of the worker, in an isolated layer.

Then, the commits are swarmed and swapped using hashes only, which can be very low latency.

So we can run a vitest system where each test file is being run in its own lambda working that spins up only when changes to filesystem are detected.

Typing is viewed as changes to a branch, and is distributed as such.  Then workers spring in to action and commit back their results.  Partial results could be streamed back to a shared ephemeral type of stream if this is important - the stream is the filesystem ephemeral state being shared, so that users are getting direct results.

We would inject into the vite process manager, where the process manager is running remotely.
It is best as remote, since when its done, it is the CI process, so it can publish instantly.
