The packages contain tests, and so we might be able to make the tests work as a way to scrutinize the output of a replacement.

Ideally all package tests should be external, and should be based upon real usage of the package.

We should be able to mimick the behaviour of each one using a single AI bot.

Or at least the AI should know how to call each one to do some calculation instead of intelligence.
