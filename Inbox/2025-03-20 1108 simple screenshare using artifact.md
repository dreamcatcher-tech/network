Surely we should be able to shadow the state of another repo, and present the same widgets to view it ?

Use the realtime streams feature to send partial updates, for things like mouse movement.

There might be a realtime comms layer over the top that isn't subject to consensus, and is just like, noisy annotations, like mouse movement, window resize info.

adopt someone elses view, so you can see what they see.

have your own separate view.
