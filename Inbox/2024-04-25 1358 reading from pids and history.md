pids are alternate universes, and history is the changes to a thing over time

All reading requests should be allowed to specify an alternate branch and a historical version.

Historical versions should be selectable by depth as well as commit hash.

Reading from a branch where you want the head causes a merge to occur where the remote branch is merged in with yours to indicate the hash.  Upon recovery, this commit is looked up and the contents retrieved.

Reading a specific commit needs to merge, since the hash locks the read in.
