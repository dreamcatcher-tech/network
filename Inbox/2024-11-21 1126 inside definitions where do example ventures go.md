For example, being able to run a crypto exchange, should be able to design a process by which this would use the dreamcatcher to launch on, and would compare the efficiency, benefits, profitability, scalability compared to an existing exchange.  Would actively monitor the stand alone exchanges for features, metrics we care about, customer usage / share of total market.

Monitor their wallet addresses to guess at the impact they are having on the ecosystem as a whole.

Making an exchange that also covered labor and all kinds of tokens, might be suitable to be in a public company.  This would be a single service provider.

Measurement of efficiency using some kind of metrics system.

Time to first customer.
cost to add a new currency.
time to second jurisdiction.
Cost of service ?
Time to new region.
compliance overheads.
resilience scores
customer response times / uptime - are you available 24/7 instantly
time to first automated sale, where a bot chose to use your service
rate of reuse - how much identity
effort from each customer to sign up
time to first value exchange for a customer
constructive competitiveness score - how cooperative was this venture with others to be of benefit to all ? AI can appraise this in a way that can't be argued with
marketing spend ratio - should be very low
virality - how many recommendations are occuring, and how many AI recommendations occuring in the social network
stability score - a service that is sustainable and can go for an indefinite period is worth investing time into, rather than something burning investment and might fall over some time.

Ideally the reputation of people in the wider network should carry on to their crypto account, resulting in less fraud.

Making activity be public means fraud patterns can be viewed by anyone on the network, since it makes the exchange be effectively on chain.

Should be that all dreamcatcher customers would prefer to automatically switch to this given exchange, since they get early usage rewards, plus they can fix problems in it and get rewarded for that effort.  No extra forms to fill out.  Range of napps that can leverage off the exchange rapidly.

Bolt on extra services like credit cards as independent ventures, which can compete.  We are anti wasteful competition.

> Basically if we make a system where AI is looking for service opportunities, and has the power to switch, then this is a powerful concept that will be permanent in the future - AI will be what gets the jobs done.

So we should make a platform where this can be reliable and safe, and where service providers can offer services into the market.  We should be able to have equivalent services be switched between in an automated fashion, and enable a few core services to start with, like cryptocurrency, insurance, compute and hosting.

Ideas buckets where they get reasoned thru the definitions.  The ideas should be put into some kind of standard bucket when they've been reasoned thru.  May have several proposed approaches to achieve the same outcome - outcome should be separated from implementation.

Reasoning should extract out a relevant summary from every file, and then view them all together.  No need to view all the full text together, and can get more focused result if that focus was brought in as early as possible.

What are the evals that would show us the definitions were complete ?

Consumer focused competition - one of the goals for the dreamcatcher, where we want a strong
Compare ourselves against a whole country economy, and show how the metrics of a whole country could improve if they adopted these policies.
Show how taxation for the maintenance of shared services could work here.

As opposed to competitor focused competition, where, like seagulls, energy is expended on reducing competitors.
Want positive sum outcomes. vs zero sum, much less negative sum

Its almost like the dreamcatcher is heavily competitive against all other conventional companies, and inside the dreamcatcher we operate on positive sum competition.

If you consider how each industry has specialized software that all competitors share, we are that common knowledge system between them all, so that they should not be competing in the knowledge arena, as we do that on platform, so they should compete in all other areas.

Once we have a few ventures set up, we can define the reusable components of shared services that make up common venture plans, which can be leveraged each tim e anew proposal is put forwards - this would highlight the benefits of running on dreamcatcher.
Extract out what common metrics are good to use to measure the venture performance, and how to apply these against competitors, with some guesses and how these metrics might compare against current encumbents, to score the viability of the venture, costs, risked outlay amounts, time to break even, and other useful metrics to decide if the venture should be started.

These serve as good ways to rally investment.
While seeking decentralized income, we can use these ventures to indicate how good it would be for everyone to have decentralized income, so the venture we should do first is the one that has the best long term payout, which would be the decentralized payout one.  This is how we decide what features to push for at any given time.

Have views of the future where based on some major future changes, the appraisals of viability might be altered - can be fed into the profitability calculators.
Also ID what service providers seem to get used by everyone, like KYC.
