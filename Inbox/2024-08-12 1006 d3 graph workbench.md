Make a widget that can take in data and give sliders so that you can explore with a model.
bot can update the list of controls, and what they give control to.
Then tell it to find the value for all the controls that represent a certain minimum, or run them all at different amounts.

So we would run multiple parallel versions of the sliders being in different places and then store the response in a heat map.
Viewer just sees the sliders flinging around rapidly.

Run multiple scenarios that are complex to explore, and use a monte carlo simulation to render a line point by point.

Show how many scenarios are currently running and how much each one costs.
