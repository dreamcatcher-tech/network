If turn it on, then when you click on a message in the display, the debugger is available to you ?

The debugger output would be appearing in the stateboard ?

Or, the control of the debugger is in thread, and the debugger is remote / in stateboard.

If we are navigating to a very deep thread, then the debugger would need to be controlled remotely, since we could be very far away.
