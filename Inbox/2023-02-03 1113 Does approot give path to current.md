If approot was stored as a path and a chainId, then we could know what our own path was at all times.

If every child must have a path to approot, and at time of pulsemaking its path to approot was stamped in it, then whenever replay occurs, each chain can know how to resolve paths relative to itself.

Self sovereign chains need to pay their own bills.
