Should all artifact actions be actually pierced into the session chain, and dispatched out from there ?

So everything you do is actually interacting with a session chain, which may alter your account chain in special ways ?

Your base chain will only accept actions that are for the base isolate, no others.  Can lock this down with a config slice in the `.io.json` file.

So your session chain becomes forked from a special base chain, and you only interact with the session chain via piercing actions into it.
