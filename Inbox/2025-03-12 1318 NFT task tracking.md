If we use these progress bars to represent tasks, then we can paint them with a fuzziness to show best, worst, and expected cases. We can have interface elements that allow us to show the extremes under different scenarios.

So that you can have a chat with the project and get the answers back in plain text, but also with the help of these widget display elements that allow a little more fiddling or a little more what-if scenario planning. 

The same interface could probably be used to compose new tasks or new series of tasks. One should be able to navigate the history to see how the project has changed over time. The same navigations could be used to inspect the drafts that you have inserted at various checkpoints or publication points in time. These may be represented by branches away from main.
