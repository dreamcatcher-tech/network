Billing info would be stored in this repo.

It is good that each user should be a repo, since that means that hosters always operate using this portable form.

Hosters could have individual accounts with people, which then pay for the hoster to participate in consensus over a particular repo.

Means the user account is fully transportable.

So we'd just have user repos, and then everything else is a flat repo.

Or, all repos are flat, and the did points to the home repo.

This better since ownership is just altering pointers or reponsibility.
