Allow you to mimick your activity on github and on the decent version.

Writes as tho it was your profile on github, and adds a link with a hash as a badge image on each ticket as a way to reference the permanent version.

Pulls in from github and pushes your issues into the decent project too.

Means you can keep your existing workflows but know that everything is backed up should the need arise.

Act like hootsuite but for github, where multiple accounts across multiple platforms can be managed at once, with a decent model of each one in standard form sitting in the middle.
