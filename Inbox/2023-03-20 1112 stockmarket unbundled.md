Find someone who can operate an online trading platform, or who would like to but has not explored this avenue yet.  Then use them as a provider of registered stock.  Then run a digital market which is decentralized, since the issuer of the digital representation of the stock guarantees its validity, and sets some rules around how it can be traded.

Unbundle the stock issuer and the ID providers, and get them to trust each other independently, with some financial guarantees held between them.

May be able to make companies be their own issuer, so long as they meet our disclosure regulation.  Then they can programmatically interact with their stock in any way they like, with a higher level guardian ensuring everything is above board.  The stock mint is on our servers, and transfers use our model to 'settled', but in between you can do anything you like.  We make sure the stock moves between allowed parties, and offer some recourse period to mitigate digital compromise, and ensure the transfer met minimum digital security guarnatees.

We ensure that rules of the jurisdiction are met automatically, actively, so you can trade safely.

Lets users take their stock offline, do whatever they want with it as tho they were registered certificates.

Can allow trading of paper certs if we operate a notarizing service, so the paper certificates are vaulted then traded with.
