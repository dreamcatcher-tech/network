This should be usable in the thread but also in the stateboard.

It would show the default config, as well as the changed / set config of this particular help.

Should allow browsing versions of this help file too.

Editing should be possible with the same display component.

Should be configured in the stateboard as in edit mode or any other mode.

Can be shown as a modal or an expansion when it is shown at the top of the thread.
