If the code was prompted, then keeping those prompts in a refined form is the new source code.

So we should be able to rerun those prompts, with a given seed, and fully generate the output, then add the patches that were added.  So possibly this is a git convention to do the patches on the commits and store those too.

make our identity be the NFTs for commits.

if the nfts are actually the currency, or the unit of value, then this is a pure value system ?  the computation used to produce the commits costs money, innovative commits cost money, etc.  The currency is commits.
