If the code was prompted, then keeping those prompts in a refined form is the new source code.

So we should be able to rerun those prompts, with a given seed, and fully generate the output, then add the patches that were added.  So possibly this is a git convention to do the patches on the commits and store those too.

make our identity be the NFTs for commits.
