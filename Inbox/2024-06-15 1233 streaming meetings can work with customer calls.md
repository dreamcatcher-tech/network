If we have a voip integration, then we can tap the customer voice stream and the agent.
We can show these interactions on the customer record as transcriptions.
We can show the bot working away to be helpful, like pulling up customer records, giving agent options, authenticating the user.

Also helps that we know the phone number they came in on, so when they come in on that number again and have the same voice fingerprint, we can pull up their records without any fuss.
