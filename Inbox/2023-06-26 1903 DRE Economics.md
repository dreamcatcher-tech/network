We need to be able to work as a traditional model using configuration parameters, but in our ideal and native operation state, an AI will set these config parameters.

Training LLMs for funds, plus getting attribution back for providing training, as well as a neat NFT to commemorate the occasion seems useful.  Can set your resources to favour NFTs from a certain source, or certain whitelist.  People have selected good models to train, based on humanitarian, profit, research, or other.

Once you can mine NFTs which act as attribution targets AND can get paid for your gpu power, hopefully we induce the same mining fad as what happened with bitcoin.  Price of commodity supplied equipment will always be better, since power often externalized, bandwidth is flat rate, compute gear was purchased for some other purpose like gaming.  Resources are effectively spare, so the price should be superior to datacentre capacity.
