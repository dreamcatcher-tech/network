Many apps have existing users and let them edit invoices and emails and other pieces of customization - this is the prime candidate for vibe coding.  Layout of pages is a huge pain, so we should allow people to just chat up a new invoice.

This module could work on dreamcatcher, and it just inserts the document into the existing app, like how you might edit something in a word doc, and then insert into the existing system.
