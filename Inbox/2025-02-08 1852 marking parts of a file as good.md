Sometimes when reviewing, we want to indicate what parts of a file we want to hold stead.

We could make a light agent go over the file and see what parts it wants to hold, so that the decision is active, and the bots negotiate when they want to expand the changes.

Means the files would have greater stability, and that the tokens we make would be similar and eligible for prediction tokens.
