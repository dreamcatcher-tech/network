using the same spot check mechanisms as for regular calculations, we should be able to do spot checks on quantum at random, and then verify the results using a large amount of compute.

users might opt in to pay a little extra to guarantee that there will be spot checks run on the results they receive.

any user can submit a calculation for verification.
