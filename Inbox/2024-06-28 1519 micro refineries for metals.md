Getting various degrees of refined concentrate, packing into armed and alarmed shipping containers, and then moving them around the world, would be much easier than smuggling refined gold.

The earth could be easily moved with very little paperwork and difficult to inspect.

Then stockpile it.

Make very small and efficient but slow refiners.  They pull out little bits and slowly refine it, rather than being a big operation.  So the cost of the op is small, the gold is slow but it gets there, which means the concentrate price is always being improved.  Might be able to be done without licenses and without environmental impact.

Get paid using this stuff internally - eg if you pay someone in china in concentrate, then they can get much more gain for it once it is refined into gold.

There may be some arbitrage opportunities to net out the payments for goods produced in China and mineral concentrates purchased from outside of China.  

The producers in the factory are always looking for creative ways to get paid, and getting paid in refined minerals reduces fees for them and their buyers, since the value creation from refinement occurred inside of China.

If the refined minerals were in a pipeline, then the payment could be instantaneous - the factory buys the concentrate, then instantly receives the refined material inside of china.  For paying in this way the factory gave the customers a discount.

Store these in smart drawer units so they can be stockpiled in a warehouse.
