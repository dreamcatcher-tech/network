If we have many example runs of codex, we should be able to say what was wrong with it, and have the system attempt and test for modifications to prompts to try and make it so those behaviours do not occur.

Each user could in fact tweak the machine to their own preferences in this way, with some higher order process deciding if this should be a general improvment, or stay specific to that user.

So the world we are moving into is apps that were ai generated just for you.

if the codex prompt was altered to suit ourselves, then 

so long as the codex tooling can call other codex tooling agents, and receive results from their long running updates, this is ideal.

we had just one agent running, and that is reasonably useful, but having the full codex cli running seems much more powerful, since it runs somehow more permanently, in its own session space.  rather than being just a thread on our systems that we have to present, it is more a "thing".

and moreover, the agent should be able to have its core prompts altered.

so if we made an mcp tool that could alter the codex prompt any way it pleased, and then could start the codex run, possibly interuptting it as well, where that running instance can also start other instances, with some sort of max depth parameter, then we have a large scale autonomous system.

Then all our UI becomes just showing these jsonl terminal formatting things around.

It could run right now, using a modified prompt, and then be able to call other codex agents.

These runs should be able to take all night.

we should be able to take the output of a run, and even tho we don't know what it is, pipe it somewhere, or instruct something to be done with the output.
