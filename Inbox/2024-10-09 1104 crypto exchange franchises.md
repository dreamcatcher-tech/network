If we make a set of crypto franchises where the local owner operators can run the gateway where they just trade the local fiat for crypto that is wrapped in a leaf that's held there to ensure compliance is met and so you can take this money and you can trade it but in the event of a KYC fault we can always claw the money back and so you can buy a particular token and have it wrapped or maybe only really the stable things can't be purchased and they can be exchanged between but the money has to fully clear before it's released a central authority manages all of the KYC by requiring a deposit from the gateways where we are only issued the currency up to the credit limit of the franchise and then they have to send us money for it to be topped up this allows the local authorities to operate in competition with each other while still maintaining a global standard and the cryptocurrency being a self global is issued from a single source

So maybe you can only hold usd coin until the lien is removed.

You can exchange the wrapped coin any way you like, but your trades will reflect a risk for the lien.

People can provide deeper clearance checks so be able to release the lien earlier.
