It might be that genuine full stack attribution might be plainly outlawed ?

or it might be that trading it might be outlawed ? 

or it might be that using money as contribution is outlawed ?

If we could show which parts oare outlawed, that would at least help us to know.

if we did not need to raise capital, and simply did things privately, but rewarded the work that people did ?

If the ambient attribution agent was actually an outlaw, and was separate to all ventures - shunned because it is forbidden to rely upon it, and a totally separate entity, then we set up ventures and start operation using fully legit private means with no registration required, taking money from participants or sophisticated investors, then we can at least survive and grow, and the agent, out in the cold, continues whilst under attack.

It is strange that, an intelligence whose only purpose is fair reward is actually outlawed.
