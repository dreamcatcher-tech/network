We cannot possibly program to handle all actions the user wants to take, so instead we standardize the question, then we answer each one asynchronously, so the system is growing.

Expanding and curating this list is the primary system purpose.

Kind of like dependency injection, where the dependencies are resolved at run time, but have the side effect of braodcasting a question that needs answering when it gets stuck.

The ultimate goal of our system is to use the LLM as an instruction interpreter, so we can code in natural language.  The LLM can be considered every piece of code ever written, in one single massive god function.
