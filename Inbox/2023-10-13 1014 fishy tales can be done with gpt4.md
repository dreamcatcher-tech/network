Hold up any standard object next to a fish, and it will tell you what kind of fish it is, and estimate the size, age, and location.  Maybe use the sun and the clouds to verify the time and place based on weather reports.

Turn it into an NFT which can be used to commemorate, and also give assist medals to those nearby.  Run a fishing contest on this, where the catch is estimated and then bought into base for verification where the medals are handed out.  We take a cut on the payment processing and any after market trading that occurs.

Can hold up images of known fish and ask it to pick the fish that is closed to the one in the photo.

DB of confirmations is build up, along with peoples corrections of what the fish is.

Let people sell access to know the fishing spot they got it from, with some optional delay, and

Integrate with the wider system of nft rewards for good weather, and reward for ahead of time tips on fishing spots.

Integrate even higher into overall view of fish stocks and trends, with advice on what can be done to replenish stock.

Ultimately fishing quota should be NFT based with a license and where that license was used requiring digital certification and reporting.

Possibly be able to tag the fish by some kind of deep recognition so that people who caught a certain fish before are able to connect with each other.

Arrange mini comps with friends who are all going out, with a small kitty put up for grabs.
Wrap around services like bill splitting for gas, and also finding other loosely connected friends to help spread costs around / come along for the ride.

Help people form clubs by giving them tools to official bond and present themselves with NFT based medallions and memberships, with funds management and event organisation with AI assisted scheduling.  Can let some members pay for others, which increases use, lets people give social debt to their friends, whilst consuming our services.
