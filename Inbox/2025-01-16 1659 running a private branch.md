On any repo that we load up into the reasoner workbench, we'd start a branch to track the reasoners data, and the execution of the requests related to it.  This would stay private unless requested.

Then the commits to the main data branch would be done in one large shot, and might be worked on in a scratch branch that gets squash merged in to the main branch.
