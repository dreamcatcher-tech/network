Problem is that so many interactions of different wys to pass actions around that it can take a lot of tracing to realize something has gone wrong.
The bugs can be very subtle.

One way to enforce this is strong formats and behaviours ?

Wish there was some better sense checking ?

Ideally the spec would be given in NL, and the intermediate formats would be calculated, by NL, as proof that the spec works.  Then we end up just coding to these interfaces, and running prescribed tests that exercise the interface thoroughly.

With some hope of making the programs automatically.
