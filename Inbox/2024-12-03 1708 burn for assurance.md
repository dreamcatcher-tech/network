we been thinking about how to put that in as a special tool, as in you call this thing when you're suspicious and it burns like crazy to ask 200 times and then gives you back a conclusion a few seconds later.

These tools would be added to the message tools of the chat, so the user could call the tool driectly.

User can select a chat outcome, and can then call the burn tool to run the question many times and give back a statistical calculation of the correctness.
