If we run it on the same drive as the data is on, we can just generate a pack file real quick ?
or we can symlink to the objects maybe ?

or we can treat commands to git as special, and intercept them ?

or we can supply our own version of git, with our own backing ?

The pack files could be stored on s3 so they're more rapidly pulled down ?

still, we want to be able to virtualize the filesystem eventually.
