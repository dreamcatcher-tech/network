If someone wants to set up a bank account, and business locations, this can take days.

So set up a network of companies and banks that act as legal outposts of crypto native entities.  All the proof of funds and source of funds is done automatically, for a payment processing fee.

Tap into our network of bank accounts around the world, to make and receive payments.

Conduct business on chain, interact offchain, with guaranteed compliance and liability.

For phantom, Compliance could be tokenized - clients promoting that they have received a compliance audit could be as simple as presenting the task they funded.  Phantom could then present their past work as proof of experience.

If we could offer compliance on a per NFT basis, with a cut of the trade value, or funding value going to compliance, to be assured of the correctness.

Also be able to pay money into a bank account, which can be used for many things, and is shared between many different people.
Treat like servers, were you can choose colocation, cohosting, dedicated.  Sometimes an error may cause a closure of some particular entities, and everyone on it needs to reconfigure.
Idea is to exit into stablecoins rapidly, so your risk is limited.

Use phantom as the payment gateway, so people can pay traditional funds, and get shares in these NFTs.

Should make each transaction be an NFT with either private or public status, and so compliance is always assured, immutably.

Phantom should publicise its own audit of itself.

We could partner Phantom with Vanuatu regulators, and run some pilots.

Make an NFT org chart system, which includes pay packets, tasks assosciations.
