Need a set of MUI components that are all fork aware.  They would be compatible with Crisps and would indicate to the user when conflicts had occured, when new data was pending, and when offline or fully synced.

Contain easy merge ability for figuring out diffs between a tree of components.
Let merge and unmerge parts of the component tree which corresponds to the data tree.
