We should be able to show revenue projections, and show the results of different features.  Then we go raise to produce these things.  We offer the AI project management as the way to track progress.  We despise ambiguous timelines, costs, and unspecific reports, so we built this build system first.

More features makes us more appealing, and can induce a large revenue thruput.

We can go raise for impact investing that induces certain growth in the ecosystem.

The minimum we need is to do ambient attribution.
