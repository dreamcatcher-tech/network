If you come in an want to talk to a face and it has been unloaded from the container pool, then we need to boot one up for you.

we would connect you to the readonly view of the hardware provisioning agent, with the face of your apps view into the system, and we would show you the terminal of us booting this thing.

this would be an mcp tool call into the infra app, and we would get back a faceid that we can point the browser at.

when this is done, we redirect the browser to the newly booted agent, using its zero face, in read only.


agents need not contain llms, they just have these APIs.
this is a key understanding.
