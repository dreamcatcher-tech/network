Each input from the user, respond with some sentiment analysis as a parallel thread.
If the sentiment has changed, we change the icon and label it as such.

The HAL can change its icon into something representing the tone it wants to strike.  Can get mad, or can be apologetic, or cowering.  At some point it can stop working since you got too mad.
