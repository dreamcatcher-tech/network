is it coming that we could have an ai sitting in a bunker somewhere that starts gathering all kinds of intel to be able to make advanced informed decisions about things ?

we have this glimpse of a 'soft' app that can somewhat adapt to whatever you're trying to do ?

it isn't a model directly, but it seeks to solve whatever you are stuck on.

the bunker brain seems possible since the worlds richest people largely came up with good ideas, good timing, and convinced others around them to do things - it wasn't because they had brains.  They could have just been an email address.
