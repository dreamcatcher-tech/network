If HAL is supposed to shadow the complex of the root chain, then what if we want to do some task that generates some new nodes that store the task ?
Does this mean that HAL would form some chains within it that would not actually be a shadow of the app complex, but would exist solely in HAL, that were for the purpose of doing tasks ?

Or, we could include these items in a section of artifact set aside for logging such things.

The AI calls should be routed thru a server where we just relay them straight to openai, for the sake of speed. 

We should rely on the chain info being sent to us later, as part of a sync thing, else no point ?

Or, is it fast enough to use chains as the relay mechanism ?
