In any industry, there are always many who are experimenting with the model in different ways.
Eg: [Selling Simply](https://www.devonportrealestate.co.nz/) is attempting to change how the real estate market works.
These outliers never seem to coordinate well, and do not share much with others save for a belief that the existing model is defiicient in some way.

We could go find these people to learn more about what our coordination products should look like, rapidly gather some requirements for a prototype, then have them as the first users of the product.

They almost certainly are too small to be able to afford good software.
