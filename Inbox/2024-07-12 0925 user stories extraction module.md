Have a conversation, or a meeting, and a bot is continually listening trying to determine user stories that were being talked about, and suggesting questions, simplifications and other things to do with getting a high quality buildable user story out.

Then when things are built, it can read the mockups and attempt to execute the user story, giving advice on what should happen at each step.
