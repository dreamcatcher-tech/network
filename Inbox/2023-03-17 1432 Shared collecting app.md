In a coworking space, everyone is always going out for little things here and there.
Make an app that reminds you when you're in a useful location that someone else wants something too.
Can be a coffee with a specific order, or some shopping items.

Claim the ticket and it guarantees you'll get funds, plus a skim.

Skim is based on incentive to help, and the platform takes a cut on this incentive.

Lets you schedule a cofee, so you start asking for one around 10am, and anyone can fulfill that for you.

Provide insutrctions on how to deliver the item.
