In a coworking space, everyone is always going out for little things here and there.
Make an app that reminds you when you're in a useful location that someone else wants something too.
Can be a coffee with a specific order, or some shopping items.

Claim the ticket and it guarantees you'll get funds, plus a skim.

Skim is based on incentive to help, and the platform takes a cut on this incentive.

Lets you schedule a cofee, so you start asking for one around 10am, and anyone can fulfill that for you.

Provide insutrctions on how to deliver the item.

Be very useful on cruise ships, or country towns where people do a lot of running around.
Notifications should be at the stores you're at, so zero cognitive load.

If you like, you can publish your whereabouts so predictive forecasting asks others if they'd like to get an order in.
