Every user has a unique ulid.

They have a profile object that stores details about them.  Ideally this would be a repo so we can replay it and interogate it ?

When they clone a repo, they clone it as `account/repo`. Every user that clones makes a new copy - we will deal with deduplicating later.

If they have shared permissions, then we only download one repo.  We know this by looking at the list of cloned repos.  They have the option of joining in the shared experience, of having their own version.  They can merge repos later and fork off at will.

So at the top level, we hold a map of what repos have been cloned, and what the permissions of the objects are.  We receive webhooks to update them, and we can set our own independent permissions.

Permissions should be set within a repo using a special file.
