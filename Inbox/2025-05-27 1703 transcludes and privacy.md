sending transcludes as chain joining requires proof.  the proof can leak nearby transcludes.

if we arranged the transcludes folder like a merkle tree, then we should not leak much info at all.
the transcludes could move randomly around, and have a lookup table in the host, but then the output is shuffled each time to hide neighbouring channels.
