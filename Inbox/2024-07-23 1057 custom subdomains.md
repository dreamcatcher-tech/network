Encode the actor portion into the subdomain url.
Means that as you share the url, we don't need actor as a parameter, since it is in the url.
Then, standalone apps like the crm, can be automatically pointed to by URL.
The CRM would become an actor, just like how a company is a legal person.

What the app does on first entry can then be customized.

Coming in on an actor url that does not exist repoints you to your own one.
