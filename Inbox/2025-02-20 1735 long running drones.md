Use solar and wind turbine to generate power, use starlink to navigate and feed back.

Defenses are to sink and hide down low for a time, so submerge to avoid pirates.

Drifting around charging up solar could be all that is needed - so long as we can keep comms on.

Can go low power, and only fire up starlink periodically, and only when conditions are right, like the rocking is below a certain level.

Can carry small amounts of cargo over to vanuatu, possibly landing on the island.

This low cost frieght service, is entirely green, and trades off time for being a huge ship.

Might be able to hydrofoil if the conditions were right.  Make it be quite a high foil to operate in larger waves.

If we got good at this, we could scour the ocean floor, possibly looking for sunk treasure, but also sell the survey data to the local authorities, since saves them.

If we had an autonomous cargo fleet, then we could deliver point to point quite easily.  Time is fine, so long as have many vessels on the water, so the thruput is high.
