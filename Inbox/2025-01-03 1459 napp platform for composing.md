Composing a napp live is key.

We should be able to do that using a special prompt, and using structured outputs to create the napp perhaps ?

So long as it didn't pull in any dynamic code to run, then we can change the prompts and compose with existing modules easily.

Build up a napps library that converts existing modules you ask for into napps inside the napp library.  These become immediately available to use.  You can pay for the import and then earn for the usage.  So when you update, you pay for that, but earn for usage.
