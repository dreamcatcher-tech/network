Composing a napp live is key.

We should be able to do that using a special prompt, and using structured outputs to create the napp perhaps ?

So long as it didn't pull in any dynamic code to run, then we can change the prompts and compose with existing modules easily.

Build up a napps library that converts existing modules you ask for into napps inside the napp library.  These become immediately available to use.  You can pay for the import and then earn for the usage.  So when you update, you pay for that, but earn for usage.

The napps can be experimented with and evals be made - it is not dynamic code since it is only file data that has changed.

They can be published to JSR as well, since that can be quite easy.  They can be stored in a dedicated repo and worked on.

When pulling in the published version, just read the repo directly and verify things are the same.
