if the buttons down the side just change what agent is showing ?
Special case is when you need to switch the active chat ?
Or switch to other agents, like how another contact would be selected.

chat selector should be part of the stateboard ?
agent selector should be part of stateboard, like how you can select contacts ?

switching the active bot also brings in the bots stateboard ?
we are changing the notion of a conversation with a bot directly, but rather we let that switch around, depending on what you're doing.

plan is to make artifact mcp, since that is required anyway.
then see if we can get a basic gui up that is mcp native.
