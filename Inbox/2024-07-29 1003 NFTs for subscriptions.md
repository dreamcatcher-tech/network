If we talk about our ultimate goal of an attribution system run in a decentralized way, controlled by AI, then is it a security if we offer subscriptions and say that when this system is online, they will receive returns from this system ?  They are receiving services on the platform, and part of that subscription is paying out to others who have done things that they consumed.  Later people will pay out to them, as a founders royalty type payment.

We show the projections in the AI, and say that we will always pursue the ultimate in fairness, but we cannot guarantee any thing, other than that we guarantee you will get something.

We can show the system running anyway, in crude form ?

They would pay the subscription, it would go to various development efforts, and reward thigns that were completed, and they could put in more money to get things built that they wanted, which could be sold in the marketplace.

This is like a freelancer platform where people are purchasing work to be done by way of paying a deposit, then when the work is done, we are taking responsibility for delivery of it, since we guarantee the quality, and work is done under dreamcatcher contract.  Then we are also reselling it for them, but they can resell it anywhere else they like, or anyone else can resell it.

This is the first version of the dreamcatcher.
