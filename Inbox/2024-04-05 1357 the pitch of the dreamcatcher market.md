If we get customers using dreamcatcher, then we can position dreamcatcher as the AI agent that people can use to manage their lives.  Then it selects from available services that make sense for the person.

If dreamcatcher is pitched as a personal assistant, that the company that you are selecting chose to offer you complimentarily, since they think it provides are better interface from them to you, then we are in between the company and the customer - we are technical on the side of all.  Then our systems will choose what is best for the client, but only if the client starts paying for their own account.

We expand their spend, so they start using everything thru us.  We terraform external services by managing those services on behalf.

Need to get all services to something like uber, where it is on demand, great low prices.

We are the intermediary, the last intermediary, after displacing all others who competed against each other and sought maximal extraction.  After all intermediaries are displaced, one will remain.
