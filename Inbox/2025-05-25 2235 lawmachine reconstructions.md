being able to take recordings from people, and have them swear it into testimony, then use these stories to base recreations of scenes.

this way we can have questions answered about a scene by bots that can piece together multiple plausible versions of what happened.

Then a reconstrution agent can run and ask questions of the knowledge agents to fill in scene details.

These recons are shown to people and they add their bits in.

logical fallacy and contradiction is identified by the bots.

if we get audio testimony then we can present it in courts.  With cross examination the bots should be able to extract out enough testimony that it can survive scrutiny ?

during the testimoney, bots would line up relevant questions they want asked.
