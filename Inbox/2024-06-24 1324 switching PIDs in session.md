Making the system aware of branches means we need a home branch - a vantage point on which to stand.

So it needs a concept of a target branch and the current branch ?
Or should it always have the current branch stored in a variable ?

Files would be always scoped to a pid, and optionally a commit.

 a system that was aware of all could not be provided to every prompt, since these prompts have their own problems to deal with.

This might be the purvue of backchat ?

We still are not doing any parallel calls to openai, as it is all single threaded so far.

Need to show the PID in the input bar.

Show the versions with a versions command that can walk back in history and return a splice for each version of the file, which includes the commit info.
Can ask to see the diff or just get the commits for the splices.
