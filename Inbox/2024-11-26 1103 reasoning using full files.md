Read in the full files, and deliberate about it, taking notes.

This is a form of reasoning but uses files to pass thru each step.

Pulling out chunks of files is false, and the chunks cannot be asserted to be correct, and they may not have been designed to be modular along the chunk boundary.

Processing the full file is best.  Can do much of this in parallel.
