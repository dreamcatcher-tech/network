If we define a corporate structure, then we should be able to write test scenarios and get the ERD bot to output a solution to how it might work, then have expectations to fact check the output, or get the ERD to say it cannot do something.

So we have our use cases described, using a standard entity language, and then we see if the structure we propose matches, and we also ask for errors or issues that might arise.

Hopefully can turn any scenario into standard terms, and then draw diagrams with standard terms and icons, but with the users specific names in them.

Be able to generate scenarios that are partial, and ask for more options after generating part of the scenario, and numbering the steps:

"say I have a customer who came to our website and they want to set up a collection service ? what then ?"

We should be able to explain negative scenarios, like bad actors, and understand better why certain rules are set they way they are.
