If we pulled the whoel artifact repo, and could browse the files, then HAL could control commands that ran things in the lambda api.

Running tests, and running hugely in parallel could be done using the lambda api.

Make a vscode editor window to browse the code.

Means the complete dev environment could done on platform, rather than in a specific machine.

So if on a plan, then the code editor would have a cached version locally, but the majority of the work would be on platform, so would be quite sensitive to network, but using the LLM would be sensitive to network too.

If we could use reasoning to define the requirements of a particular piece, then we could generate complicated parts, like tree syncing, and other pieces, which would rely on the specs of other parts, like the backchat interface.
