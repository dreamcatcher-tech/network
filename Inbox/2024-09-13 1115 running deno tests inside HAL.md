If we pulled the whoel artifact repo, and could browse the files, then HAL could control commands that ran things in the lambda api.

Running tests, and running hugely in parallel could be done using the lambda api.

Make a vscode editor window to browse the code.

Means the complete dev environment could done on platform, rather than in a specific machine.
