Have places round the world where the costs are transparent and people who are digital nomads can coordinate to stay at them and share resources and knowledge.  Have cars and other things to share by way of paying and booking.  If you don't want to book in advance, then we can have some kind of payments to ensure availability.

Cooking and cleaning as a service, so we pay say 2 local people to do the labour for us, and also busy them with labour of neighbours if we have overflow.  

Then people can come in for cheap relative to other options in their quality range, and can know where all the funds are going.
