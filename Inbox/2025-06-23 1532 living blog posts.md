by debating and conversation, we agree upon a set of atomic facts or assertions, that can be external or novel, and we use these as the basis to generate the blog post from.

Next layer up we control the structure of the post, and tweak for tone, length, comedy, and other packaging concerns.

Then we provide a bot that can talk about this post.
When people ask new questions, it can form new atoms, but in an untrusted mode, since we were trusted.  If you have trust, then you can make deeper modifications to the post.

By debating, if the bot thinks its a good idea, then it can cause the blog post to be rewritten.
We can allow structure to change, and original atoms to be changed, by setting permissions flags and trust level flags.

Because we built the post by debating, further debate is just part of the construction process.  We release the post, and then we keep debating it, and the machines keep reshuffling the post, live.
Bots being chatted can answer ancillary things, and can anonymize your questions.

Run the question thru a cheap bot first to see if it is relevant, and convert the post suggestively to something relevant, then send it to the big bots.

So you'd start with a few key facts, start discussion and debate and refinement, where the bot debates you, or you talk to your friends about it.  The bot is capturing live and reconciling plus objecting or asking further questions.  At each step it is generating new blog posts.

Self extractive loop - it keeps writing new versions then retrospecitly extracts out all the atoms that were used, until all its info is grounded in atoms only.

Some of these atoms can be shared between posts, but they should all be part of one big pool, but some can be unique to this post.
