If we get some beta testers to sign up and start working thru issues with us, then we can grow outwards to include more people.

Beta group starts to hook up their NFTs, and include their feedback in AI NL form, and starts to have NFTs minted representing the things they want fixed.

They start communicating with each other too.

Then if we hook up the unreal engine piece, can show visual representations.
