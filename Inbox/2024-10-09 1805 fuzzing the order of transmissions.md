 check no faults when we run transmissions in different orders, and with delays.
Means that in pooling we are allowed to execute in any order.

Unless we have a transmission branch which guarantees order.

Between repos can be subject only to rules, but transmission between repos we don't have as much control over order, hence why we need a branch with commits.  Then have the two IO json files in there, acting as a matched pair.

Somehow signal the merge the other side is up to.
