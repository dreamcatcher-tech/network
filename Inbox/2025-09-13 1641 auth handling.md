instead of an auth handler for every computer, we could make a dedicated fronting app that does all the wildcard handling, and does auth, then keep every client computer in a private app with no exposed public addresses.

so by using flycast, we keep the apps hidden from any traffic except the gateway app.

Can client computers then talk to other client computers ?
sign the replay, so correctly functioning apps will reject fake replays.

so the users come, get authed, then get those creds checked against the actual app target they way, and then if that checks out, the request gets replayed over to the actual app.

That means the internal names are never seen by the outside world.
the client apps stay super focused, in that they only do the processing of the incoming traffic after auth.
