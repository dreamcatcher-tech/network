Should list a set of constraints on the bot, and then run some tests and see what the output is.
They try making different temperature implementations of the bot and scoring them in the tests again.

Loop around repeatedly.

Look at the constraints and see if they can be rewritten.  Highlight conflicts or difficult requirements that the human should spent time on.

Means that the bot should be written by pure low prompt AI, and it uses its intellect to reflect back on the actions that occured, then try make a little structure of its own to test against this data, and keeps on repeating itself like that.

The key is that it can build on its errors.

Should be able to pull in prompt tips from all over the net and try them out.
