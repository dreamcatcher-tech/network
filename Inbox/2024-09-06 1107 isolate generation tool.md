Make it lay out the variable names and purposes that it intends to use.
Lay out the algo in plain text first, before doing an implementation.

Each time the user gives feedback, extract out and update the requirements statements.
When regenerating, try to keep the variables the same.  Make it compliant typescript.

This multi layer code approach means that it can reason about the code better, and in a way that the human understands better, and the human can modify it.

It could try to discover further requiements, or ask clarifying questions that become part of the requirements.

Based on the requirements, it can make better quality tests as well.
