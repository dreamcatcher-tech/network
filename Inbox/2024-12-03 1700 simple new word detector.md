Run during conversations, and just simply detects when a new word is being said, causing focus to shift on to defining that.

Allows the AI to keep up with the conversation, since it has all the definitions in context.

Keeps humans on track, and eliminates sloppy or duplicate / multiple definitions speaking.

What about predictive text for speaking ? when you are live transcribing what you say, and the model can generate several reasonable completions for you, using the definitions, but also can have a short list of other definitions or good joiner words that you can use to help you ?
