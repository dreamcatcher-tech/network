We should expect a basic format.
Break this into UI elements / AI components, where the tests can be arranged in a tree like the jest describe and test statements.
Read the whole page, and then list out the test names.
For each test name, extract out the purpose of the test.
Then loop thru generating a test using the Dave bot

Then, do variance on the requests, so that the system is tested using wider NL inputs.  We can use the AI to test the AI to ensure we have a system that performs well under a broad range of user inputs.
