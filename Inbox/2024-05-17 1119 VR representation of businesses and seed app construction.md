If we can make a 2D model, then we can use VR to have automatic zoom abilities to take in large data with rapid scope / zoom changing, like how the world globe looks in VR.

At a certain LOD, can swap pieces out for a more informative long range view object.

Can give us a way to see how bulk processing pipelines are going, in a simpler way than presenting a 2D interface.

If the interface can be modified using NL, and the AI tries its best to match what you want, then you can have near infinite customization.  

Being able to ask for anything, and if you can't get it, a request for this function is automatically created, that is rapidity.  The fastest possible iteration.
