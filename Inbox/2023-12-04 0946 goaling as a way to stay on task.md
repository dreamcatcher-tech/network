Every goal should be relatable to a top level goal.

So in a company, what are you doing and why, should relate to the goals of the company.  Each time Dave comes up with a new goal, if the goalie cannot relate it to the company goals, Dave would get questioned about it.

In your life, if you try to do something that isn't part of your goals, you would get questioned.  A suggestion might be that you should change your goals, since they are currently inconsistent.

Then, with a good goal structure in place, advertising, shopping - all these things can be preproceed by HAL since it knows your motives.  If your motives are shared, then people can come up with ways to serve you, or a group of you that segment the same way based on your goals.
