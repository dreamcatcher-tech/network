Take several tablets and chain them together in a foldable pattern would provide the ultimate workstation experience on the go. The issue is having a mount or a case that can support this type of configuration. There appears to be a way to sell the joints hardware separately from back plates, where the back plates are the thing that changes to adapt the size of the device. 

now what that means is that the corners or the clasps they can be either clusped on the back if there's a dedicated way of doing that like with the espresso displays or they can be clasped on say just two corners is really all you need we can sell adapters for the corners to make sure that the mold fits exactly the clasp would be very thin metal with deeper rounded edges so it doesn't hook on anything and they would be tensioned to make the fit snug from that point we only need to sell the hinge hardware and you should be able to connect up and do as many hinge configurations as you want which would mean that you can fold together tablets of different dimensions from different manufacturers we can sell spaces or rods that allow a short side to fit and hinge with a long side you can do fold-to-gether like a book you could do fold over the top of another fold so the hinge when opened is adjacent but when closed is spaced enough that another tablet could have been folded flat we can make those clasps on the corners have little padding so that they can book fold together without incident without scratching the glass and finally we can make a stand like system they can be made of plates that fold out of the back to give it structure they should be very lightweight very configurable and if we provide this sort of basic strapping system for these tablets you can bolt on whatever hard way you like you might even be able to make a covering case that goes over the back or whatever you like but basically you should be able to very rapidly make a nice-looking case they can fit any kind of monitor in any kind of configuration and hit the road with a completely portable solution and you can strip it down around reconfigure it in the field if need be
