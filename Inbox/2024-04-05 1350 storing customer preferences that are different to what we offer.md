If a customer wants a service on a given date, it might not be the best thing for them.

We should store what they prefer, so that if our ability to provide it changes, we can let them know, plus we can use this to measure demand of things they would want if they had the ability.

Each time we email them, we should be able to write custom emails with a bunch of extra relevant info.  A doctors practice should be able to send out a newsletter with custom info for the clients, like when tests and things are due.
