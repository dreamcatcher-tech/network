Could constantly sample across all usages to pick the best tunable parameters.

Use the massively multithreaded capabilities to run simulations of tunables, like matrix benchmarking.  Rather than one at a time, can run all tests in parallel across 100,000 cores.

Matrix test can run time to add 10,100, 1,000, 10,000 customers to the CRM, but since running in parallel, and costs the same as running linear, huge benefits in terms of time for getting results.

Provide a dashboard to show chain progress, so can intercept slow processes.
Show all processes on a grid, possibly a cube, and let you cull running processes live.

Random sample first to get a guage on the sucess of a render.
