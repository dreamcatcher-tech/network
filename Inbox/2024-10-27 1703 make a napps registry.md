Show how your code can get called from multiple diffrent AIs.

Part of the tooling we provide is to eval your code against different AIs.

We are a hosting provider, and offer being able to run your serverless functions easily.

The other tooling is the automatic generation of header info for all the different languages you might want, like python, rust, js.

We would auto generate all the different sugar that makes packages easy to consume in their native language.
