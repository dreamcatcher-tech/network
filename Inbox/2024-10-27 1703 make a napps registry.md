Show how your code can get called from multiple diffrent AIs.

Part of the tooling we provide is to eval your code against different AIs.

We are a hosting provider, and offer being able to run your serverless functions easily.

The other tooling is the automatic generation of header info for all the different languages you might want, like python, rust, js.

We would auto generate all the different sugar that makes packages easy to consume in their native language.

Make this registry searchable easily, so people making AI apps can play with all the functions offered.

Coming in with multiple languages, and all have a gateway api access, so they can be hosted, and can call out easily.

Multiple apps can be connected together, probably live in the registry app, with the interactions being debuggable.

It is also portable, so we offer some hosting, but anyone can offer hosting with various guarantees.  We only show those that adhere to dreamcatcher payments systems.

So we would really a general serverless compute registry, offering secure, scalable execution of any language.  All packages run in isolation, on your machine, or ours.  We offer high levels of parallism on execution.  We offer perfect repeatability of the infrastructure to aid in debugging and tuning.

Our registry would generate versions of a package that was usable by every other language runtime that we support.

People could publish very thin wrappers around popular packages.  These could be done largely by AI, and would represent the first large scale AI coding task undertaken.

You should be able to download the whole registry onto your own computer, and should be able to get paid for seeding the packages like how torrent servers work.  Leechers get asked to pay more, and in general everyone is encouraged to pay a small amount, in money, or in bandwidth.
