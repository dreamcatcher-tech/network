The ability to know definitively what the next state is, seems like a critical service.

So for this, we would maintain coco git repos that can assure that, your repo is always going to be available, and that the knowledge of latest is authoratative.

also the release of keys to attested environments, and only to those environments that are running with the correct version of latest, this is critical to the portability of the workload, the permanence of the state of the workload, and the availability.

being able to access this top level chain seems critical to doing any work.

So perhaps it should be part of each persons computer, rather than something central ?
perhaps the key release mechanism is best run by each person directly, with maybe a shared helper service that stores the keys for emergencies ?
