Steps in ambient attribution

1. Dave/HAL interaction to trigger jitter creation
2. Jitter construction
3. jitter consumption
4. impact measurement of the jitter consumption, in multidimensional space
5. attribution of each dimensions magnitude to the components comprising the jitter 
6. distribution of the value transferrable along with some exchange rates and compromises

Should go see Rod about impact assessment and talk about this multi dimensional piece.

Works the same as how courts attribute damage assessments.
