if everyone had an agent friend, and they could chat in whatsapp.  then this agent could connect to others helpfully.

install helper on your phone and it can share location automatically to help people find each other.

so it would make the agentic computer available via a face in whatsapp, so you can talk to it using a whatsapp contact.

have different contacts for different purposes, permission settings, repos.

or have the same one and run a router in the background.
