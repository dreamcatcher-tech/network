This needs some looping, since the diagram might not render correctly.
We would need to try parse the code in mermaid, and feed back errors into the chart, whilst continually appraising if it meeds the instructions.

Then the human should be able to chat and manipulate the generated charts.

So long as it has this check test, and the diagram is treated separately, we can display a nice UI for logic to the user.

So the [[2024-04-30 1642 spec reconciler for security of an application|spec app]] can use sequence diagrams based on the spec of the app, and can ensure these render correctly and represent each step accurately.
