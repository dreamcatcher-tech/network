The issue is that ethereum and others have got widespread adoption.  So we need the coins to be based on these chains fundamentally.

What we then need to provide is a lightweight transaction framework so that the assets themselves can be moved around very cheaply as tho they were wrapped.

Also turned into cash, for use with consumer purchases and other things.

But this wrapping ability is about the same for any asset, so building the base asset, the tx cost isn't that important.
