System operations can be transformed into things that are anonymous, and then if enough noise exists, they can be published, or summaries can be published.  We can also generate fake load.

The purpose is so that the operation of the system is open to scrutiny, so that further tests or changes in process can be toyed with, whilst still maintaining confidential information.
