Can publish snapshots to npm perhaps ?
Can provide attestations using the attestation services github and other provide, to prove that the state is xyz and that the operation ran on their infrastructure from the commits that were given.

So, if the system gets into a known good state, then we should be able to show that it stayed in a known good state.
