If we had bots that acted impartially, that bridged the regulation requirements, and could let people argue about them and ask questions, and know the state of their own account (flagged, near limits, etc) then this is as good as it can get.

The exchange is fully transparent, on chain, and AI powered.

It acts simply as an intermediary between the regulation and the users, as well as the money systems.

So it isn't so much an exchange per se, but rather a money transmitter, since the exchanging should be done entirely on chain.  The exchange should not every be holding customer funds, it should only be bridging between fiat and crypto.

It would have a small float that it used to make transactions instant, which anyone could pool money in to, and which earns a yield, based on a fairly calculated fee.

There should be very few regulatory environments that require the regulation to be kept private.

We could help customers pre-emptively, like by colouring their transactions, saying what was suspicious, giving it a chance of being flagged, and explaining the motives behind the questions, and providing helpful possible answers.

It would help users prepare docs ahead of time, so they could get pre-audited and have no troubles, plus it could pledge to defend its users against regulatory actions, since it complied.

If you pay the insurance fee, and do all the compliance, we will defend you against search and seizure.

It could act as an enclave for your personal information, and fill in forms or provide info only when you allowed it, to make meeting compliance as simple as you reviewing what the bots were about to send, and knowing that it will be sufficient ahead of time.

We can trust our users, since we can trust our computing environment.  So we can send in an audit bot, and if we know it ran on trusted infrastructure, we can trust the result without seeing all the info it processed.  This is the ultimate audit, where a bot runs, like an agent, that you can interact with, but at the end, it says pass or fail, but it can prove that it leaked no info.

You can also run theories to your hearts content, and we can supply bots that can try test theories for you, so you can be as elaborate as you like, but you have to be compliant.

We would also watch social media and automatically respond to reports that defame the exchange.  We would be a bot run exchange, and would not hide this, but rather promote it.  Our business goals are set in code, and the bots execute on these things.  Anyone can start a new project on this exchange, but you have to pay for it yourself.

We can help you hold accounts on multiple exchanges too.  We help you interact with the financial system compliantly and effortlessly.  Never fill in the same form twice, sometimes not even once.

Can see your friends, talk to your friends, and can compare results.  Can pull stats from the exchange, like how much is being transferred, how much held on hand, how much the payout pulls, current speed of payouts, which banks the money is moving to, what nationality the users were in.

Basically the price of joining is being ok sharing some anonymized data about you, and in exchange you see the anonymized data of everyone else.  Can connect chain analysis tools in, can ask for your own tools.

If you build a crypto product, we should be your choice for building payments straight in, as we do your user management, and handle all that difficulty, you just focus on your app.
