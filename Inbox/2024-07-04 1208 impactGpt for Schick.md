They have a motto of "benefit all who contribute" so we should be able to create impact crystals for each of their projects and each of their staff.

Safety improved, safety negatively impacted.  Let people theorize how things they could do differently would impact, and if everyone did this thing, how would that affect everyone.

Show some examples of tasks going about as bad as possible.

Show the other dimensions they have stated on their website, team, family, community.
Show money as a dimension on there.
Show the longevity of each solution they make.

Show these impact crystals on jobs they are tendering for, to decide what price to go in at.
