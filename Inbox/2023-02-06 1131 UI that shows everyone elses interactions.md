If a UI was built with a standard API and the interactions were public, then a decorated version of the UI could be shown that accumulates everyone elses interactions, so all users can see what people are using and how.  New users can see how to use an application based on tracing what others are doing with it.  Famous users can be shadowed and have their interactions replayed.

Each UI component should also support this heatmap value display in some way.

Worst case a CSS color is just placed around the object.

Mouse trails can be shown too.
