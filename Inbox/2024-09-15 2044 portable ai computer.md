Make an eink screen, like a 25" one, and a raspi on the back, with a large flat battery pack.

The screen is all that is required for ai functions since it displays the text output sparingly, and reading is more important than rapidly changing the UI, like scrolling.
Have sections of the eink be dedicated to different types of screen update, like rapid or slow or button like things. 
Scroll in jumps, rather than smoothly.

Could store caches of your working dir, so you can see the files while offline, but that is all.
Would be like an advanced caching feature that pulls down the whole repo ahead of time.
