Use 3 large tablets as a main computer, so can fold out each screen, and use each to manage a different conversation with gpt.

Keyboard can fold up too.

One pair can be set to fold out like a laptop with the keyboard on it.

Use a split keyboard.

If they all just run an android app that connects them all together to share some browser cache, then that is useful, plus they can all get paired off somewhere else.
