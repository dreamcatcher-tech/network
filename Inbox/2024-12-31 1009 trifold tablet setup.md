Use 3 large tablets as a main computer, so can fold out each screen, and use each to manage a different conversation with gpt.

Keyboard can fold up too.

One pair can be set to fold out like a laptop with the keyboard on it.

Use a split keyboard.

If they all just run an android app that connects them all together to share some browser cache, then that is useful, plus they can all get paired off somewhere else.

Basically 3 folding tablets seems more reliable, cost effective, and redundant than other options.

If have a big one in the middle then little outer ones, can take the small ones on reconnaisances.

Ideally it would be your main workstation, allowing you to work anywhere.
