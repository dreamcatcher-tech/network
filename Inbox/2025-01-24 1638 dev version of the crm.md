branch stays in sync with the main crm, but the changes are never pushed back, and the changes can be reset altogether.

We deploy a UI that points to this natively, in its env vars, and this is where changes are tested before being deployed to production.

Just make them UI on demand, and slowly move it over to being widgets, gradually, with chat included.
