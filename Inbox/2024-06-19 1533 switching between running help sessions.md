Could be for all sessions you have open ?

Or just for the agent sessions that were opened as child sessions.

Can get to this screen using backchat.

Hotkey that throws up a list of all the agents and lets you cycle thru them all.

Backchat can show this list and let you pick one with chat.

Let you have multiple agents on the go.

You should be able to say something and then have HAL allocated it between all these different agents wherever it thinks is necessary.
