might need to be able to clone / shadow mcp servers, and show everything that is going on inside them.

so inside a frame, we should be able to shadow another mcp server, or act exactly as it.

we should be able to do everything that an agent would do, just with mcp calls ?
everything except streaming chats would be available ?
