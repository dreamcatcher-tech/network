Rather than a new app, make a whatsapp group that has a bot in it.
You can talk directly to the bot to ask questions, or put in instructions that need to go to several groups that the bot is part of.

It will check with you before dispatching the emails and whatsapp messages that you have asked.

Individuals can put their time availability into the bot.
