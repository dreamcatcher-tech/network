Rather than a new app, make a whatsapp group that has a bot in it.
You can talk directly to the bot to ask questions, or put in instructions that need to go to several groups that the bot is part of.

It will check with you before dispatching the emails and whatsapp messages that you have asked.

Individuals can put their time availability into the bot.

Give context, like "open the gates for Phil" so that other participants can know why gates were open.  Detect patterns, so the bot says when it expects Phil to be gone based on previous usage.

Start selling components to add to your smart home to connect different things together, like locks and other things.  The plans are open, so if you want something custom, this is the platform to use.
