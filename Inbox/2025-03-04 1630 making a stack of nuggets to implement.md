Talking to LLM yields solutions to long standing problems, but we aren't always ready to implement them, so they should be stacked and related to the things we want to do.

They should be a type of idea object, which isn't a direct patch, but it contains info that humans or machine could use to make an improved solution (or any solution at all if it is stuck).

These would be things we think are valuable, and they can be refined as we move on, but they still need to wait until some other conditions are true.
