if we thought of the computer as an agent, then all the agents are just subagents of this one ?
the computer is the root agent.

it is a little bit special since it never does any jobs, as such, and it doesn't have an agent.toml since it holds no intelligence in it ?

it holds its own proc tree, which makes it special.
