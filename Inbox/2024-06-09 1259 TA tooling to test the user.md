Once we have been given some examples of a trend the user wants to leverage, then we can provide a game window where we present candlesticks and they say if it is the pattern, yes or no.

This can tease out if the user was relying on a bigger window to make their decision, or some extra information.  We can use this ruleset as a further tuning method.

They can categorize ones as almost not, so we can call out discrepancies in the dataset.
