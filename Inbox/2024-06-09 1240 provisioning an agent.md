First we need to do the programming of it and the testing.
Making a standalone repo for every bot seems excessive ?
Could fork a base repo, and the top level names represent the work being done.
Then actors are instanced at one level down from the base branch

`configuration/agent/session` is the naming convention.

But setting up a new repo is quite heavy ?

How will synth based programming be integrated in this model ?

? What is a help in this model, then ?
We should be able to store many helps in a single repo and pick from them, like a catalogue.

An image is what is used to start up an agent instance.

Can we make a cheap version running as a branch ?
Making a session with an agent that is disposable should be simple ?
Some agents may be able to learn from each session and upgrade their programming.
Specifying the commit to boot the image of means no learning.
