As remote users do things, we should upload their repo to a larger master repo.

Then we can navigate to that repo, so we can see what they are doing whenever they do it.

Our view should render exactly as theirs.

Should be able to see stucks that were created by them and merged in to other locations.

Preferrably they would be syncing up to github, in near realtime.
