in the data space that handles connections, we might be able to do memory palace training to make better use of unused space, and have some means of rewriting this when collisions occur.

from SL.

the notion is that we have a trained llm that can reason.  but then to help it retrieve facts, we train it how to alter its weights by attaching facts that it has accepted into placeholders, allowing it to make better use of the vector space, by knowing how to retrieve, and by recognizing a packed memory vs a trained memory.

Something seems missing in the memory being able to change the thinking, and keep doing so as it grows.
