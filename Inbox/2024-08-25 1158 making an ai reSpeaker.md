Highlighting fallacies, repetitions.

Either party can list out some fallacies or things that annoy them.  They get appraised and refined for reasonability, and compared against a global list of common annoyances.
Then when the other person is speaking, these things get highlighted like warning bells.

Suggestions on how to ask questions a different way are presented to either party.
They can both be assured that the AI agents are not sharing any information with the other side, but they can know that the other side is receiving suggestions of a certain kind probably.

Let either party store up some topics for later debate while someone else is speaking.
Ai will auto rank importance of the topic or the question.
Allows deduplication of the questions.

AI can speak a summarized question for you.
If an AI voice sounded like you but said something much smarter than you would, might you like that ?
