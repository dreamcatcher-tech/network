if we have ts implementations and analysis by todays AI models, then we can show that, whilst we know they are not perfect, the models will improve and our surety will increase.  So basically if we place our structures right, and side back and watch, then the rising tide will lift us.

we will start seeing a world where ai proposes new solutions to famously hard problems, like consensus mechanisms.

So if we well define the problem, and the properties, then the bots will eventually start solving it.

for consensus, we would have a shortlist based on properties.
