Select from a bunch of components as to which ones are relevant.  Turn that into a glob, then include that in a concat.

Generate instructions for the cursor composer to implement when changing one project into another.

Always move from working state to working state.

Have standard things you want to do, like turn this example into this other thing, or implement this spec from scratch and then the platform tries different approaches, like getting an example.

It should be able to brainstorm about how to get solutions, like go find examples.

Work in layers, where the features we want will be built upon a foundation that needs to be well reasoned, well specified, and the requirements at tests laid out so it has flexibility for extension but will still remain stable.

It might be that when implementing the next layer, we do that layer, and then rerun the base layer as the changes are reconcilled between the two.

We should seek to insolate changes to a particular folder in the project too, since the smaller change radius the better.
