Make a suit of handles and padding so a toddler can be given a joy ride while an adult gets a weights workout.

Supply and app that targets areas the adult wants to work on, and shows example moves they could do.

Accelerometer to show what moves the adult is doing, and have a rep count.

Count the effort expended by the adult just based on pure movement.

Hopefully get some exercises the toddler can do at the same time.
