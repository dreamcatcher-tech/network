If the chat context widget has history in it, what does it mean to show the diff of it ?

Since the widgets are live, it doesn't make any sense to show a diff version ?
Diff view would show the raw json underneath, if this widget allowed itself to be represented like that.

Would could show a behind the scenes view that could be turned on, or we could just show the item at that point in time.

Might want to show a prior version, but without a diff view, there is not comparison, it just shows as the current version using the default display widget.
