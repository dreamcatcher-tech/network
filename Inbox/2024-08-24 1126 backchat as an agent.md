If backchat acted as an agent, then it could do the thread switching functions, but in thread.

Should any given agent be given the full thread history, or just things pertinent to them ?

So you start in a basic thread, with all agents available.  When you do something, like log in to the CRM, then it might switch you to a new thread.

Starting a new thread might be just replacing the thread file ?
So the channel / terminal stays the same, but the threads get cycled.
If you want to reset the state or the changed files, then you can ask for that expressly, otherwise the files are still there ?
