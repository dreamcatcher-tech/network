If the QA is an AI to start with, and it gives hints and issues with the document before it is submitted.  Down the side is a list of identified issues in a standard form.  This issues list can be expanded.  It also links to parts of the document identified as problematic.

So a user can see what the QA will see, and can see suggestions about how to fix it, as well as some examples that do the thing QA is looking for well.
