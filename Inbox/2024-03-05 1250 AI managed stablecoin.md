If we could make an LLM run in decentralized fashion, then we could have a stablecoin that was balanced by the LLMs reasoning.  Its compute would be paid for by the tx fees of the coin.

The oracle fees would be looked at by the LLM.

Special beacon accounts that can signal to the LLM that the feeds are suspicious, so be extra vigilant.

It could be able to figure out if something is incentivized to lie to it on an oracle fee.
