for each agent, there is an auth handler, that takes in all traffic.

there is only one port listening on each machine, that is 8080.

we need some setup scripts that do things like pull from github.

boot the tmux session that loads the header processor, 
on the root of the agent, show the default face.
config says if you make a new one on landing or not.

if its tmux faces, we can set path options for them, so each one sits at a dedicated path and knows about it too.
this is special to ttyd sessions, which is very general, so makes it easy to run cli apps and just have distinct paths for them.
