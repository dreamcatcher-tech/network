Projects like GitHub and others have a vast list of issues and problems that the users have reported about them as a service. 

We should scrape those and grind over them to try and find the balance of what the perfect service would be and to guide the development of our own service so that we can avoid major pitfalls before they even happen. 

Interestingly, it may come to pass that some large clusters of requests that we see across multiple product sites are incompatible with the VC model. Use cases that rank very highly in this incompatibility and ones that we should seek to push for first.
