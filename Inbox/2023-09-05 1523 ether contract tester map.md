If we provide a visual tool to view what is happening to the state of a packet, like a diagram, then we can fiddle with functions and see how it responds, which might give more insights than just looking at code.

Maybe abstract the functions that call into this core model, so we can bypass many of the checks of the core, and so we can simulate things ?
