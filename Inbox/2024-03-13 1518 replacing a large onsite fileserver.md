If we use storage connected to backblaze, or local servers coordinated as a redundant pool, a business could use our cloud to store large amounts of data in artifact probably for cheaper than they could manage it onsite.

Can manage onsite caches to supply the data to clients much quicker than purely remote services as well as giving some offline ability.  $6TB/month for backblaze, which is pretty affordable.  Being able to access and process the data in pipelines is important.

Generating summary images to make the data findable is important.

Could be videos, and do transcoding otf.
