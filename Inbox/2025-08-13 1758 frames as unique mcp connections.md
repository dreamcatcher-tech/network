These would form their own connetions to the server.

The scope of their allowed range would be set in the client ?

So the app host makes a proxy server that just relays things around ? or it only allows construction of one kind of limited scope server ?

the app host presents an mcp server to the client and it must connect to.

the frame presents an mcp server to the client which it optionally will connect to.

notifications on frame resizing can be included here.

Each frame can make only one mcp connection ?

it could request tools and whatever else it wants and the client may oblige, or it might ask the user for permission.

Given that the mcp server can be navigated to anywhere, this seems fully capable, and we only need the one server.
