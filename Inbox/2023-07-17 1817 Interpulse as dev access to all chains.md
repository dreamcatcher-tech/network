If we can learn to wrap chains, and keep them updated, then instead of devs needing to use apis to reach eth, bnb, and whatever other chains come along, then we can replace these end points.

Providing decentralized api based access to these heavy and slow and expensive chains would be a massive functional win.  Makes it more likely that running on our chains is the best platform to build on for any blockchain app.  Anyone needing a gen2 chain will value the features we offer much more than any other random dev.

Moreover, if we can incentivize distributed parties to keep the chains in sync, by paying them a portion of all the calls that are made, we can keep this part distributed too, which is stronger against corruption or downtime.
