If the stateboard throws up a sorting tool that can be used to arrange items one after the other, then it needs to show along with the prompt as a piece of structured data.

The history of messages needs to show what was submitted, and the user should be able to click on that message to see what was submitted along with that message.

They should be able to cancel the current sort which will reset it back to default.

Compare historical versions should be possible in chat.

Think this is a .json file that is being modified by a tool.  We could ask to see this file in other viewing forms, as well as get it read into context for direct interpretation.

Be able to edit multiple files in the stateboard to be submitted with the prompt.
