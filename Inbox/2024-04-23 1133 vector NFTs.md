Make a horizon worlds game where we can show the vector NFTs, and can make theoretical ones too, like what we would like to see.

Make them summable, so you can merge multiple ones into a single one.
Can also split them, both evenly, and dimensionally, so can sell off the vectors of some dimensions and keep hold of the others.
