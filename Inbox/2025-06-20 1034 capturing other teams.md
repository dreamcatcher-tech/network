Other teams that are working on similar infrastructure-simplifying projects will have the same issue where they haven't tackled the complexity of their incentives. The need for contributions from the outside world and attribution based on it is common to all. We would be bringing that solution to the collective table. 

For any given project, we could demonstrate how we could AI clone the basic concept that they're striving towards and show how our AI contribution systems can accelerate the growth of this project faster. We could, in effect, force them to join us because this is just a better way to manage development cycles and incentives. 

Any project can now be AI-cloned and reasoned about, and can probably iterate faster or be more cleanly developed at a far lower cost because there's no people involved. You can either open source now and get some credit for laying the starting scaffold, or you can keep it closed and simply be outpaced. Seems like the only thing that gets rewarded is sharing ultimately. 

Can blend some teams, like the dark team, and the postgres cloud db team, and some of what we're doing.

So as soon as we can master this ongoing AI driven development, then these teams suddenly start to have a shot that their concepts can grow, but these products will merge, since no point being different unless conceptually different - there is no identity in your owners.  knowledge becomes commodity.

So the next major burst is these systems that can develop highly complex software rapidly and reliably, and can manage simple software patching, certing, as a unified whole.
