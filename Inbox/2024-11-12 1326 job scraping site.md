Almost like a bash script where you can set up some workflows to walk around job websites and generate cvs, perform your own research.

Could make a dedicated purpose tool, or could make a collection of napps that can do this on demand and get wired together like a bash script.

The key is the shared scraping pool, where you can share the pages with people.

So you might not pay for this service directly, since it is flat and one off, but you would pay for it in terms of AI credits that are being burned.

It would be like a bash script that ran some times.

It isn't made of any pieces that are not generic, and so if we provide a platform for doing these generic things, that is a money spinner - filling a thousand little gaps.
