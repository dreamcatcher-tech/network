1. load up the artifact mcp tools that can control the fly.io infra.
2. it will create you an app that is homed to your user id.
3. it will create a base image, that is your home agent, as this is what you will start interacting with

what about a base agent that does this just using prompts ?
move to that after we have at least one agent running.


as your chat progresses, the agent might decide that you need to spawn new agents.

1. the agent makes an mcp call to artifact using the agent control mcp toolset
2. the fly infrastructure tooling is loaded, with credentials for your particular app
3. a new machine is created with your config you wanted in the agent
4. the machine is prompted as you wanted to be prompted, via an mcp tool call
5. the url for connecting to it live is sent back
6. when it compeltes, the notifications api triggers and restarts your agent, or queues in a message if its running, telling it to check the results location
7. now you have work completed

The agent chat is available in artifact under agents/agent-id/chat-id
That agent can itself call more agents.

Might be easiest to have an infra agent that is always on, and then we chat to it to create our user accounts.
