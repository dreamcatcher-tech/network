We can complete this module if we can cover all of the formats specified in JSON-C, and we have executed tests that include files and streaming and streaming with files as well as the regular request-reply options and ensure that everything has strong type checking. 

I think the best way... Is to have the simplest working version of the system and then make sure it works end-to-end. Then come back around. Start a requirements document to add in extra features so that the types get incrementally changed rather than being very confusing. The typing seems quite a mess...
