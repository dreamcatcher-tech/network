first time you hit the page, you hit an agent that is geared to sign you up.
when thinks you're ready, it will present a link for you to click on.
this does the oauth loop, and now you come back and you're authed, and you get a brand new agent.

It presents a link for you to sign in with, and then this handles the oauth thing for you.
Serve a parent that has the auth stuff in it, then serve a frame that hits another route but passes credentials along.

for each installed app, there is an infra management agent, which specializes in fly infra.
there might be two of these, and it is named, as opposed to being a specific machine, so you talk to one of two, which makes it redundant.

You could ask the infra agent using plain text, as opposed to a function call ?
this means taht you the human can go talk to the infra agent any time you like.
