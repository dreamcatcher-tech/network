If you can't trust the queue, then you can't trust the system.
Every queue action must be repeatable, so reruning will give the same result.
If all the users actions immediately are stored on the server, then they can never lose them, and we automatically can do teaming and debugging, so even for doing sorting in the stateboard, we should push those changes up to the server in an ephemeral git branch
