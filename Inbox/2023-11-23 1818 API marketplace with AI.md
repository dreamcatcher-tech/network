List a system, describe the API, and then we should be able to automatically generate something that can connect it up to any other system you want.

So if you want to connect it to the ETH blockchain, we can ingest the API easily, and then pipe it to an interface that can be auto generated with an ETH contract, or go in via some shared contract on ETH, which incentivizes many people to make and share the API calls.

We can also do cron jobs, or any other amount of processing.

Connecting to ETH uses a bridge so that you have good guarantees that we are genuinely making the calls we say we are, and it saves the https info with the request for your verification.
