the prompts feature is how we would define an assistant in the form of an mcp server.

so to make a new assistant / bot, the tool you need is what makes an agent capable napp.
That is, it lets you make a napp that can handle chat interfaces.

then you instance it somewhere, at some path on the repo.
then you can do tool calls against it.

so we need to be able to make a particular chat bot that is locked to its own dedicated folder, and reads its config from that folder.
