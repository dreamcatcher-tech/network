is there some way to express the consistency and timing guarantees of a system, like a globally distributed s3 clone, so that we can be assured that all types of concurrency are at least addressed, and compared to other systems, and can have tests build that verify the model assumptions ?

Can this model be proven to be exhaustive ?

The goal would be that, if such a model was created, and tests made to prove it, then this model could be put into an LLM so that it could answer any question that was thrown at it, since it would be an exhaustive model. So the LLM would translate the users question into a simplified form that can be tested against the model, and the outcome can then be translated back into the users scenario and discussed with them.
