Make them be a sensor array of mics so that we can do listening at a distance, like hearing aids, but with expanded capabilities of sound.

Auto record whatever they hear, so if you are taking a call, they provide a separate recording function of both streams of audio.

Modular means bits can be swapped in an out over time.

Each cup can be the same tech as what goes into a voice puck.  Could make a cup detachable and act as a puck.

Can put the pair down and separate the cups and monitor a meeting audio with them.

round bits can at as sensors so you can scrub timelines acting like a job dial.

configure the taps and motion and other device nearness any way you like.

jack them in to dreamcatcher platform as a sensor, so that all the other tools can trigger of them.
