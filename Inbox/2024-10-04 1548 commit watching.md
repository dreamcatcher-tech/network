Need to watch backchat commits too, since these are always relevant.
When watching a thread, we should always watch its parents, from when remote actions come in, and its children, when remote actions go out.
In this way, the long running threads can be watched

Commit explorer should have a target branch, and then would always walk backwards over commits that relate to it.

If you click on a parent and then make that the focused branch, then you see everything that relates to that branch.

OR if the tip of all related branches was always tracked ?
Needs a different mode where can watch all the children ?  
All children as default might overload the system ?
All tips of all children, or all tips of all parents.

Arrange the commits by chronological order ?
Cache all the splices so we can avoid making some server calls.
