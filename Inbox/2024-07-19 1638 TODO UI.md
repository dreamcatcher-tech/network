longthreading
write files to the parent branch
execute any isolate function
update HAL using an instruction
answer questions about any isolate function

detect markdown in backticks and render it as markdown
when backchat starts a new thread, it should pass in an initial prompt if it deems that necessary.
pick the latest unanswered prompts for the operator to consider
threads should scroll to the bottom unless the scroll is stored somewhere.
help agent should know about the system operations
make items in a thread be deletable
session url sharing
hard stop repeated function calls without a break.  Later add intelligence to detect loops.  
threads that switch should show as blank as soon as a new threadid is used
threads should be cached for when the ui switches back, and some indication that it is stale
test toolchoice option in agents, which might be drone based
give it a noop function to call when it is done, always, if it is a drone
test the infinite loop test
api.mv should be light
Preserve input when backchat hides and shows
Threads should have links so we can click on them
Performance of loading long backchat
long threads should be virtualized
check that messages are using deep equality to decide when to rerender
title in the urls
button on each message to show raw text, as well as copy the contents.
button on each mermaid chart to copy the code or toggle showing the raw text.

What to do when a command is intended for a remote triad ?
Eg: I want to tell backchat to start a new thread, but this needs to be done in the backchat branch, so that the focus switch occurs.
So if the isolate can tell who its controlling backchat is, then we can do it ?

Deploy files in ui will clash

## Big ticket items
Remote repo sessions
Customer record searching
Search for agents should trigger stuck loop when missing
