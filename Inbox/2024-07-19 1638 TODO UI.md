Preserve input when backchat hides and shows
Threads should have links so we can click on them
Performance of loading long backchat
long threads should be virtualized
check that messages are using deep equality to decide when to rerender
title in the urls

What to do when a command is intended for a remote triad ?
Eg: I want to tell backchat to start a new thread, but this needs to be done in the backchat branch, so that the focus switch occurs.
So if the isolate can tell who its controlling backchat is, then we can do it ?
