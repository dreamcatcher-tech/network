I want to talk to you about the concept of the "stucks horizon".  I don't want to get tangled up strategic vs whatever, but at any given moment, there is a set of furthest away stucks.  Of these, several will be ones that we have chosen as ones we want.  The commander would then chart a course towards them as best it can work out from the provided "stucks map".  The concept I want to talk about, is that as soon as you get closer to the horizon, it lets us see a new horizon, and we might sometimes switch to something new that appeared.  That should be considered normalÂ operation.
