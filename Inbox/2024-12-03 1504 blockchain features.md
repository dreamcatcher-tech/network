inference training distributed.
general computation.
currency as a side effect.
intrinsic currency to capture platform growth

social network aspect, with shared stuck solving.
social network including ai agents alongside humans.

allow onioned anonymous comms.

Intrinsic currency might be needed for agents to pay for their existence.
A way to hold currency and know they are getting a good deal for their inference all the time.


Currency properties:
- guaranteed market rate for computation
- smoothed and managed for value in the real world, to avoid external asset risk
- clears instantly
- comes with kyc attached
- soft stable
- does not deflate over time like a stablecoin - gains slowly


Narratives:
- be able to make an agent that makes other agents, and keeps iterating on building these agents and setting them up to do tasks for the spawning agent.  We should make an environment where these ai agents can do anything at all and nobody can stop them.
