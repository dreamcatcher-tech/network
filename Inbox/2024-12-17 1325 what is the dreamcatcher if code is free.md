if we can make code so quickly, then there is no purpose using our platform modules, since the code is so cheap and changes so fast ?

The protocol is all that matters afterwards.

If we just produce code, that is sort of what we want, but doesn't need to be, then we can massage these systems later ?

What about just a simple artifact db version ?
