A market cannot form where switching is not possible.  Every industry that has part of its workflow as a non switchable thing, will eventually be disrupted by a marketplace.  Industries whose current model relies upon client retention will be replaced with a switchable marketplace.  Markets seem to be beloved by nature - nobody likes being stuck without choice.

Also required is public pricing, so any industry that tries to keep its pricing secret or bespoke will get replaced.  This can be seen in software developers not wanting the feelance pricing they charged being seen.

More subtle requirements are public bids information, so everyone can see what the market is bidding for a given switchable resource.  If the resource is scarce, then depth of bid is also required.
