A market cannot form where switching is not possible.  Every industry that has part of its workflow as a non switchable thing, will eventually be disrupted by a marketplace.  Industries whose current model relies upon client retention will be replaced with a switchable marketplace.  Markets seem to be beloved by nature - nobody likes being stuck without choice.
