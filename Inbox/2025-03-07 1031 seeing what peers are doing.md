Being able to see the types of queries and outputs from co-workers is extremely helpful because it lets you see or have summarized for you what they are working on. This way, you can offer some inputs or at least have some understanding and be aware of it.

So if you hit a similar query to what they are dealing with later, you can know to call on them. It would mean that our individual agents would be more likely to have more information on our particular topic to work with.
