Be able to trigger cron and delays in queues so we can get the AI to do things later, or at some interval, or keep figuring out the next interval based on what it did.

Management of AI apps might mean watching the execution using tooling and jumping in there when we see the bots go awry, then patching it before anyone notices.

If we were working with users live as soon as they had a problem, before they realized they needed to talk to someone, then that is a great experience.  The AI would first trigger that it thought something had gone wrong, then next a human (or many humans) all converge on the problem, and you watch it go higher in rank and cost and ultimately see a fix rolled out to you and some attribution back.
