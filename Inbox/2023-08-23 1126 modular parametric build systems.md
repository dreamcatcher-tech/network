Can do this for houses and home appliances.

Have some base models, and allow people to design with them very naturally, using natural language and gestures, and an AI can interpret what they want, and make modification then meld those in to be practical.

Surface issues and limits that it hits a lot to try build a more flexible standard model, when limits are struct.

Gives people exactly what they want, renders it beautifully, builds an attachment in them for it, then provides a means to get it made locally and at almost any price since can consider second hand parts in it.
