Can we get the AI to write small bits of code that use regex to manipulate templates at large ?
Might be better if they wrote some code, like a kernel, then we test it a few times, and it gets it right, then it runs it at pace.

If these things could be stored somewhere, along with their docs, then they can be reused across the internet.
