Blocks should have a promise attached to them representing
Blocks should then be frozen, to prohibit further modification.

Based on the assumption in IPORM that one block belongs to one class, and all instances of that class should be the same thing.

## `.crush` 
This should return an object that has been deduplicated across the object cache, so two objects that are still in reference that are of the same block should have reference equality.

## `.uncrush` 
If there is not a cached thing in the block, it immediately sets a promise to block others from uncrushing in parallel.
Once crush is complete, it attaches itself to the block, so any future uncrush can use the object cache.
