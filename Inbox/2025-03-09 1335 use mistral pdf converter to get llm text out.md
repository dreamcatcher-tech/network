Seems best way to extract text from any pdf. 

Probably other services for translation are coming soon too.

We should also have some base load for tasks for OCR as well as keeping track of the benchmarks, so that we're notified whenever they update. That way, we can always be assured that we have the best that we can find, and we're also monitoring the next best two and three.

For example, if there are some niche uses that seem benefited, we can swap these things in and out. If you're defining a workflow that has a number of steps in it, one of which is OCR, and you find that you're not getting good results, then you can just swap out that individual piece to a different service and see if the results are any better for you. 

Or you can insert a human in a loop at a checkpoint or below a threshold, so that the human will actually fill in any gaps or double-check it as part of the workflow.
