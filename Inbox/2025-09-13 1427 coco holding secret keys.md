we can actually trust a coco to hold the signing keys to some eth wallet.

the keys to the coco are replicated around a bit, so that multiple machines can start up and have access to them, which means that the eth keys are backed up under the same conditions.

so the coco can sign transactions and manage say, DAO funds.

so this is all the integration with the eth chains and other things that we need.

we can ask it to sign things, based on rules, and then other workers can broadcast out the things.
