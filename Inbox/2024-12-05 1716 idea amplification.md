When creating nugget ideas, sometimes really good ones happen and their isn't a good way to prioritize them.

being able to stake currency about them is a good way of prioritizing and announcing.

currency can be relative, and your own, but just sets a kind of ranking.

Could make a genuine stuck and put real funds against it, to ensure it lives on forever.

If each stuck was an ai agent tasked with solving it, the game gets really fun.
