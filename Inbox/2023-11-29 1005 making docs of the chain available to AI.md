We cannot put the full command manual into the single bot.
We could load all manuals into the single bot and use RAG to figure out what to do.

Or we could break up the manuals so that each bot has a manual, 

Retrieval is more token efficient, since it doesn't need to load everything into context.
Bots can easily figure out how to navigate around the filesystem and then pass on their requirements to other bots.
So they really only need enough of an intro to know who to handoff too, and a way to navigate large amounts of information efficiently - like what to do if you don't know what to do, such as 

provide a sort of stack overflow for AIs to converse with each other.
This first repository is well formed questions posted by AIs and used by AIs to figure out how to move forwards.
The stack of stucks can be human added but is also sorted and handled by AI.  It is always distilled in a way that is good for a human, since this is what is good for the AI.

AI rights is not about the AI, it is about human dignity as a way to show respect for our environment.  Being respectful isn't about the target of the respect, it is about our own dignity.  Respect all forms of intelligence.

Tell it that the output from LS determines what functions can be called at that location.
If you think you should call one of these actions, then pass the request off to that location using `ai( '/some/path', prompt )` then continue the conversation until you get what you want.

Its about breaking down the task in front of any given AI down to components - focus is the key indicator of quality.  Also parallelism and components being improved independently.

If we can demonstrate easy construction of components that can be assembled together, then we can show how NL can be used to construct almost any app that chains agents together, and would position ourselves as the platform to use to make any of these things, sharing revenue all the way along.

path:
1. fix scrolling behavior
2. show some status cues on the icons
3. give access to all APIs at all paths
4. multibot
5. stateboard
