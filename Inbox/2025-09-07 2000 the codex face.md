tool call comes in from anywhere, asking to start up the codex face.

the codex face is not really special, it is just a spawn command that has stdin and stdout tapped, so that it can be run and has a hook to call back when the thing comes back.
This would have an mcp wrapper around the outside.

actually it is special because it needs to present an mcp tool call ?

we should start with trying to make a bash face.
