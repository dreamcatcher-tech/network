For example, something like winemaking. We could provide intelligence that can look at the data of the systems that are running and can make suggestions on how the different things you're interested in can be improved or modified. Plus, you can chat with your systems and ask questions about your systems. Plus, you could have a connection to a marketplace of humans that can provide specialist advice or a marketplace of AI agents that can improve different aspects of your business based on this intimate knowledge of winemaking or whatever specialty service there is. 

The idea is to go around to all these companies that have got specialist niche products with a lot of data and work with them to produce a way to allow our platform to communicate with their data or help them migrate. Then we have a way for agents to run over that data as an additional offering to their already existing client base. 

The good part about this is that many of these existing systems are unlikely to be replaced by AI in the short term because they are very specialized systems and there's a lot of historical data that's somewhat locked up in there. We'd be providing these software vendors a way to have a more modern approach, gain additional revenue streams from their customers, and use all the data that they have as additional revenue-generating assets.
