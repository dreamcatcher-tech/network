Provide sketch space where the top level conceptual art is toyed with by inputing what the entity is all about.


Makes top level groups of things - the brand pallette, icons, vector art, text, fonts, tshirts, hoodies.

Then it generates a gallery of clothing with your artwork on it.

So a complete pack of all the artwork in all situations can be generated.

Inpainting can be used to show it on hoodies and other garments.

Play around with temp settings to get something you like, and have that theme carry forwards as you iterate using image interpretation, transformed to text, then used to modify the prompts you are giving in.

So basically the napp would manage the prompt, it guides you thru questions and processes your feedback.

This would be connected to a range of image generation napps.  It could be connected to specific ones, or NL interfaced ones when there are new ones.

It can read in a given napp to get instructions on how to prompt for that particular thing.

Whenever the company name or purpose changes, the artwork can regenerate.  Use triggers like if it changes sufficiently, then regen the artwork, so the logo represents sort of a version stamp of the entity.

Have a pipeline to make svg out of something.
