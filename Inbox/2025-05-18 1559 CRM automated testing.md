If we had a full digital recreation of the existing system and we knew that it was a hundred percent accurate and reliable, and it became the system of record. Then we can use that system to generate automated testing against the new date-driven format. 

Why this is advantageous is that the comparison between the two systems can be set up as simply an automated test that cycles through different days, both in the past and in the future, to ascertain whether any modifications in the algorithm are giving the equivalent results. 

From a software point of view, zero chance of an error existing.
