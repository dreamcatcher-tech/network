Variations can create many posibilities ?  So a chain needs to be considered the same as a single prompt.  The variations are generated 

When switching between actors, we just use the same variance generating rules anyway.

The outcome should provide prompts as arrays ?

Viewer for the thread should be just the normal HAL thread viewer.

Is the whole HAL interface just a widget anyway :thinking: ?

How to submit several chains in ?
