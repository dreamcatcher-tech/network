Write a special function that loads up all the agents, and pulls in their descriptions ?

Or, load up the full files using the links in switchboard.

? How to restrict what agents switchboard can access ?

Auto summaries of the agents could be generated using some kind of a build step ?

But we also want switchboard to be interrogatable, so if switchboard itself gets spoken to, it looks at the reasoning it did and provides the next response.

We could make a separate bot that handles how to explain the switchboard, and provide help, like switchboards little helper.
