what do a laundromat and a mining / earthmoving company have in common ?

if you pay someone to come to your house and do your laundry, then you will pay more than taking it to a laundromat, since the laundromat has no dwell time - the machines are fully loaded due to everyone elses jobs, but at your home, the person has to wait for your machines to finish.

So a better deal is a person who comes to your house, and takes all your laundry and stuff away.

earthworks cost a lot because they have to come to your house, and do the work with no dwell time.  But if you had a small cheap robot that worked around the clock, monitored and controlled remotely, then the price of the earthworks would be considerably less, and it could work in difficult spots.

the value of the machine depends on how much it costs, and how much useful work it can do per unit time, where its price means it can do more per unit time.

So have a small machine that loads up dirt into little containers that get moved offsite.
This same principle can be used for mining so that we can us computer vision to separate earth with ore, rather than chemicals, and if we small batch refine then we can get maximal reuse of the chemicals used to do the separation.

The theory is if there was minerals in one spot, then deeper down there should be more.

As AI physics models improve, they will need less specialized machines, so it will be just the camera feed and the controls and a model of the machine, and it will figure it out.

These mini machines should have instantly swappable battery packs, or super cap charageable things.  Refuelers are big caps that go round upcharging the others so they don't have to come back to charge points.
