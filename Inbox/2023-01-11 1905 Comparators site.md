There used to be a site named something like bench.js where you could easily make a quick piece of js and run some benchmarks against it, then share what you did with others.  It went offline.

There are ofter times when multiple libraries do the same thing, so the comparators would allow this to be benchmarked each time there is a new release in a many different ways.

Can let people submit results from their own machines, so different platforms can be tested.

Matrix comparison between different versions of the library.

Comparisons using ranges of inputs.

Making it distributed would allow you to publish in README.md but also people can download it, run it, fork it.  Can run it live in your browser or select some other machines on the public cloud to execute it.  Can select from the matrix of versions, can add your own row to it, can supply your own results to it.

Can be extended out to opinions, like features in software, and can use wikipedia as a reference.
