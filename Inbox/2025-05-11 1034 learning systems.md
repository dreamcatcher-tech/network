Every time I have to correct the machine on something, they should remember and reflect on it, trying to figure out some rules so that it never happens again. 

Initially, it is acceptable for it to have a large number of rules as it tries to grind down into short, concise summaries. 

The ultimate would be if it could push back on me and ask that I change my behavior in some way or give it some extra clarification. 

Its goal is to reduce the number of rules down to nice simple things, and I should be able to go in there and talk to it about these things. It would be able to say what examples it drew on that led it to conclude that I wanted this sort of thing. 

It makes the customization of the LLM far more direct than a global taste setting that one particular vendor tries to achieve.
