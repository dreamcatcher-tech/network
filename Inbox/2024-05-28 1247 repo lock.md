Using git lingo, repolock is held by the index.lock file in the repo.

Make a generalized lock device, that can use keepalives to extend the lock, can steal the lock if the timeout occurs, can await the lock with minimal delay between lock release.

May allow a queue to form to avoid lock contention ?  Or just use the opportunisitic settings.


All ops should await the repo lock to be open ?
Or just try, with repo lock being blank being a prerequisite.

If failed due to lock conditions, then begin waiting for the lock release.
Start the lock watcher process in parallel to the first atomic, and await it to be clear each time.
Re-wait with the same watcher each time, since just awaiting for the next release to occur ?

Any operations will need to await the repo lock.
Pooling is allowed, but no processing can processed.
Basically a commit is not possible until the lock is released.
We may do a branch lock.

Need a separate flag that signals repo death, so that pooling gets removed.
