If we were to make a computer operator agent that could navigate an existing application, then we could produce a clone and test the functionality of our clone against the existing running version. We could also record user interactions with the existing application as well as our own interactions so that we could digest them and have scripts or information that tell us how the program behaves. This body of knowledge would get built up over time, so that when we're making design decisions for the new version, we can feed off these specs that we've explored or extracted from experimentation. Any time we want to check these, we can call up another operator to go off and verify how that works. Humans can occasionally come in and watch what was happening and provide extra steering to the system. This can result in top-level requirements or guard rails that the humans put in place to guide the development of the clone.
