Firstly, the file runner needs to be run in its own thread.
Once it is running, it provisions all the cases in the tps report.
Then it invokes the test runner isolate on each case, preferrably in parallel.


Each case runner should be able to fork the interactions of its dependencies, to start quicker.
The case runner is run in a new branch, and then it makes branches for each iteration it runs.
The case runner would generate variations if it was required to.



When a case runs, it might have some dependencies to run first - should it just fork off the commits of a prior test case ?

It needs to sort out the order of the test cases, so that each one runs after its dependents, so it can fork from the system state of the prior runs easily.

Case runner could be in band with the filerunner agent, and then it just makes each interaction be a fork.
