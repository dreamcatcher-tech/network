we need to know the corrections people make to our drafts, since these are even more important than the emails they send.  From this we should really burn to learn why, and then blind test ourselves, so that assuming we knew nothing specific, would we make the correct response.

Sometimes it might be that people need to change it just to feel like they did something personal.

Also them being able to speak at it, like correct it by talking to us is very useful too.

Then, across a company, show summaries of all emails going out, and detect all jobs and processes that are in flight just based on the emails.

Based on past history, detect where the stalls are happening.  Trip alarms for things to watch out for.

Deduce and make flow charts from email flow.
Show it fuzzily, since it won't be exact, but we can make heatmap versions that show where the majority of loops go.
Can chat with it.  Show the heatmap weighted by value, and also weighted by cost.
