we need a blockchain so that we have trust.  This trust comes from transparency 

we need AI to do attribution.  First to figure out contribution, then impact, then attribution.

While many of the features in AI we like are already maturing in AI space, a pure blockchain model is nowhere to be found.

We see no stuck loop appearing anywhere.

So we should have at least the base features of the popular AI platforms, and then demonstrate our basic value, then build up with the more advanced features the industry is producing ?

Running a DAO where the AI allows members to update a knowledge base, and build a bot on chain as a dao using votes.

Then we ultimately want to get to be a decentralized computing platform.

## Contribution AI
takes in a git repo, and some usage info, then works out who made what contributions and how valuable they are ?
