If a human needs a web page to interact, but an agent can use a cli or an api, what's the difference ?

What if the agent could be set up to use a browser page of an app, just to get started ?

What if we caused all humans to use browsers in a way that we recorded their actions ?
Then we can distill these down to turns, and we can learn about what the human intent is ?
