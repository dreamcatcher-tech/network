each time we begin some work, we should be able to say what is the top level feature we are improving.

Then we could point it at any given page, and get it to enumerate the features on the page, in a standard way between multiple pages.

Then we can say what features we think are the main drawcard, what are sticky, which ones we want to be migratable (so if you are using a feature on another platform, we want an easy migration path for you).
