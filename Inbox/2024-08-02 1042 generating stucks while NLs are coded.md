While a user is working on getting some tests or NL agents / systems working correctly, there should be a summarizer in the background generating a description of the stuck it thinks you are trying to solve.  You can update this manually or give it some hints.

If we can show the detection of actor stucks, and dev stucks, and show how they get published and incentivized, this is a key milestone of our system.

This can be described as a context diagram of problems being generated internally, being published

The context diagram of the dreamcatcher should clarify everything.
