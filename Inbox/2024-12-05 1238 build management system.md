Reasoning about the thing to be built.
Generate the stucks for the implementation.
Monitor progress by rate of completion of stucks.

Then the reasoning becomes part of how the app knows how to use itself, since it walks the reasoning.

It's own usage could be used to reflect on how to improve the reasoning, and create stuck as to what is missing from the reasoning.
