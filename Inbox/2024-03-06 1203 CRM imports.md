Store one file for each xml record, and may as well store the complete record, provided that it can be POSTed back to the server to write things.

Then store a template file for all the text documents that are inside the database.
Store a mapping file that maps the xml records over to the text template inside the db.

writing to a record involves updating it in the db, checking all the business rules have been applied correctly, triggering any consequences that need doing, then triggering an update to be done.

Updating back to moneyworks means looking at the last retrieved xml doc, then seeing if any text documents were updated since then, finding which xml records are outdated, and posting these up to moneyworks, followed by a pull on any records updated since the last check.

All the while, the user should see the status of their change, up until it is copied down from moneyworks as the change is confirmed.

Make a folder called outbox that has xml docs that we want pushed out.
These would only hold the fields that we wanted changed, and nothing else.

Each txt record would be tagged as 'pristine' or not, for when we make changes to them.
