In some cases, we could make the remote thread be the default thread.  For the CRM, the user would often never see the backchat base thread, and would spend all their time interacting with the base thread.

For power users, this would show as a rerouted thread, which would be escapable from.  For non power users, the remote thread would look like the base thread.

We might be able to make the base thread be the remote just by talking to the system.
