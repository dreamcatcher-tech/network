modules:
1. influencer scorer, ranker, broker to negotiate
2. campaign planning, experiments, data processing - ideation for plans and things to try, balance budget and spread, rank based on expected returns.
3. analysis tools, like sales feedback, processing sales data, warehouse data - ideas on how to interpret data, and how to ask for help with little tools.


If we could make tools to rank influencers and be able to contact them, then we should be able to make a module for the influencers to use, which can broker back, seek out opportunities actively, and be part of or included in searches.

It is like search has changed, and no any platform can be a search engine for a particular thing, and be something that attracts advertisers to it.

Then we would broker connections between the influencers and the advertisers.

Marketing is a good one to capture, since it is peddled by people who have latched on to things that are hard to measure, then they convince you that you need to buy it.

So a few highly capable growth marketers, suitably incentived, using this platform, should be able to show max gains for your company.  Plus you can investigate ideas and be guided thru how to set up campaigns.

We would use this ourselves to figure out how to get exporsure.

Can also use this to organize events with influencers coming to various gatherings.
