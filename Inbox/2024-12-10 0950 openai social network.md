SA hinted at some kind of collaborative effect they were seeing between people.

We aren't seeing any social network like features in these models.

"this is one in particular where there's a new kind of co-creative dynamic that we're seeing emerge between early testers that we think points to something interesting about AI creative tools and how people will use them"

But this might have been just single users talking to the AI, rather than the social use of AI systems.
