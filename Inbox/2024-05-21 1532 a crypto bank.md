An exchange is like a crypto bank, but not enough.
A crypto bank would be regulated like a bank, but would deal in crypto.
It would use DEX to have liquidity, and would make batched transfers to save everyone fees.
It would guarantee the safety of peoples money, and will only permit transactions that it deemed compliant.  It would ensure that all your behaviour was compliant, and would also shield you from theft.
Purely self sovereign money doesn't work so well since people lose it.  

The bank software could be run by anyone, and so it is the services that you come for, and the people that are backing it.

The AI helps you learn about different activities that you could take part in.
Pay other members directly, pay overseas invoices, have a credit card.
