If we raised capital to build the platform for NL apps with this internal model of fairness, is that a valid thing to attract capital for ?

Running as a DAO, then each project could be a series LLC that had a dedicated mandate.

Then we can attract traditional private capital to each series LLC, and smaller crowdfunding raises at the project level.
