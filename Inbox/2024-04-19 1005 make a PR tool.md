When you clone a public repo, then want to push back, you need to open a PR.
We will create the fork in your account, push your changes to it, start a pr, write some helpful descriptions.

This would all be done with a simple command from you.

Merging in other peoples changes would be similar - we pull it in, run all the NL tests, reject or approve with helpful feedback.
