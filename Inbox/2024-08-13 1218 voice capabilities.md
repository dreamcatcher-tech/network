use livekit to do streaming webrtc from the browser, which can be transcribed by deepgram.

Then use sip trunking so that people can set up their own inbound numbers that connect to their instance.

telnyx for sip calls.
test the call latency and uptime availability.

Have meetings where you stream in audio, which is transcribed on the fly, and the bots start working away in the background.
Set up a bot that is tasked with trying to deduce user stories at each point in the conversation, and it surfaces those in a side panel for you.

So if you use our platform, you can easily set up an inbound sip phone number, which is transcribed, optionally recorded, and feeds into an app.  Plus can make outbound calls, where some of those calls might be done using a bot ?

Then we can charge for the line rental, but we can also sell the service of having real people answer the calls, and ensure they are nice with good personality on the other end, and always attentive.  Give good affinity with calls, so we have long term commitments.

If the audio stream routing and muxing was controlled by a json config, then the bot could be tasked with recomposing any way we like.

Faxing can be added too, with recognition of documents and workflow triggering.

Basically have conversations and have streams of audio that get saved and transcribed.
