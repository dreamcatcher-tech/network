be able to make a remote control session module where if I have access to a user's session then our mouse clicks are streamed between each other we could also stream our audio and video between each other so that in order to have a call we just need to find each other in these sessions. I can select what they select my selection can change the selection on their side of things I can type, I can do anything in that window having two selection models going at the same time seems impossible but the purpose is that being able to walk them through particular problems highlight and point out features within the application and receive instruction from them to say how they might want things to have changed

Allow drawing on the screen in a way that disappears after a small delay.

Livekit could allow us to stream these things between users.
