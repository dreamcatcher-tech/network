We should find people that are enthusiastic in the AI space and have a certain following, because all of them are trying to monetize what they do with varying approaches and successes. If we said to them, "Hey, why don't you let us handle the backend infrastructure? Here's a way to monetize and have users as well as provide a file system for users to upload their private data. We handle things like SOC compliance and package safety and all those other boring but essential things." Then these users would be more likely to drag in other users to the system. 

So we should really be making a place for power users to hang out, solve problems, monetize them, and have their services purchased. Get a following, use promotion, those kinds of things.
