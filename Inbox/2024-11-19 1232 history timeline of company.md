Crawl articles, like tech crunch, and use google and the wayback machine.

Take snapshots of the pages that are fetched.

Assemble a timeline of key events that can be chatted with.

Let a human manually curate these timelines, and provide their own asserted information.

Allow for whatif analysis, and then calculate the implications of the whatif on all other companies around at that time.

Collect a range of these things, and then output summaries, to give some statistical meaning of something we might like to attempt to do.
