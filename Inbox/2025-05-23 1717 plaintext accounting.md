If we could use plain text accounting to present a standard set of accounts for a company, then these accounts could be easily parsed by bots. We could also build widgets and views on top of it to provide whatever reporting was required. We should be able to track and model any kind of asset movement or money movement. We could then have these records over time, because sitting in a blockchain is the audit trail. We'd then be able to get a human or set of humans that operate as a service to rubber stamp them.

The accounting system would then be something that people could chat with and get human answers back from, because the bot would understand it very easily. The bot could make what-if scenarios and things like that. It just seems a much easier way to do things than having custom proprietary databases, custom formats, Excel spreadsheets, and other such painful systems.

Basically, the system would mimic a large number of very skilled accountants doing manual jobs. We could present agents that could do conversion of any account into the standard format. The standard format would produce a great Rosetta Stone of translation between multiple systems, which often big clients need. Information comes from one, goes into another. We would need to keep a backing record or ledger record of changes. This would be it for us. 

Different agents could be presented that had different skills, like they understood different things about accounts, different concepts that they used as their grounding backing knowledge.
