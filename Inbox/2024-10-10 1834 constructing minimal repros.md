When given some git commits, we should be able to note the fault, and try to construct a minimal version that recreates the fault, but has no personal information, and is as simple as possible.

The bots would loop over the simple example, and ofter roll back to previous versions.

Note down previous versions and what they tried, so they can snapshot roll back to iterate with a different direction.

any time there is a choice, they could run in parallel to explore all branches at the same time.
