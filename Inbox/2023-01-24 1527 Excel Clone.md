Use operational transforms as the file format so that merging independent copies of the file is trivial.

Files come with history, but can be squashed.

Live editing is the same as regular editing - can send the file to someone, and ask for connection to edit in parallel with each other.  Can send the file as an offline file, then open it up and begin collab editing.

Does collab editing but without a server in the middle.

Benefit is being offline first, with full control given to the local administrators with extreme privacy.

## Construction
Each formula can be treated as a plugin, and the development of it can be outsourced to other people who get [[Ambient Attribution]] for their inputs.

Mobile versions as well as webpage versions can be released.

## Compute
Allow massively parallel computation to occur by using chains to represent calculated cells.
