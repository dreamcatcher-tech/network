the choice to require a napp to be installed is a delicate one.

one could write a napp that took an action, installed the other napp, and then uninstalled it, so no real difference.

the main point seems to be that the act of installing pins the hash.  if we don't pin the hash then we cannot recreate.

plus permissions seem more stable if you have to install first.

mistakes seem harder since if not installed it won't just run it for you automatically.

tracing seems easier, since most napps are intended to be bonded to their repos long term.
