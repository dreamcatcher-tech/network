Each entity should be a separate file, and should be summarized for inclusion to compress prompts, but it should be loaded when needed, when the topics are named, so the bot has the full definitions when it answers.

The process of updating these entities should be almost a specialized process - make a widget that lets you rearrange, delete and otherwise change them individually.

Filter would be just showing which entities relate to a certain query of yours.

Using these entites as the basis for knowledge about a system, the bots can then give reponses whenever questions come in.
