If you want to gamble, we offer a fair game, educational materials on how probability works, simulators, and an open API.  We thoroughly verify that children are not playing and we ensure people can afford to lose with proof of a higher deposit.

If you still want to play, we take your losses and we reinvest them in startups, which you can choose, where we vet those startups for quality, and yank funds based on poor performance.  Some of your funds go into the gambling float, which handles payouts when gamblers win.  This earns you money each time money goes thru it, so you do start to get your money back over time, but you cannot touch it until time has elapsed.

The deposits we require to prove you have funds can be used for anything else you like that isn't gambling, including small stocks investing and other things.

You cannot withdraw the phoenixed winnings directly, due to regulatory restrictions, but you can gamble them thru again, and you can withdraw anything you win.

Despite probability, people still choose to gamble.  By offering the best possible option for these patrons, we can avoid them being preyed upon by exploitative operators.

All our pools and services are API based, so others can set up operations that use a whitelabel version of our services.  We control what happens to the funds, in that they go to a venture pool, and we control that quality of the available ventures, but nothing else.

Some of these companies can be zero liability if the profits they earn come entirely thru our network rather than using fiat.  

Could view a stockmarket as a game of skill of others - whilst the payout is determined by the environment plus skill of the actors, the person making the bet is entirely at the mercy of the honesty and transparency of the actors.

Give addicts tools for assessing any gambling site as fair or not.  A way to record their activities using agents that route api calls thru, and a way to compare with each other what their experience was.

Is it still free if you put money into the backside pool, and play against yourself ?

Marketing would be done as tasks that have a fixed payout / commission, and also attract long term royalties.
## Extras
API based playthrough to allow investment with guaranteed thruput.
Invite other projects to pass scrutiny.
Trading of the securities.
If project reaches significant decentralization, then the tokens can be publicly traded.
Generalization of gambling

## Polygon version
Using a low tx rate chain, we could make an operating casino in solidity.  Can avoid any infrastructure of our own, with a static page that loads and connects to a bunch of api providers like infura.  These gaming gateways allow people to invest in a security without requiring the regulation, since they already lost the money.

Each session or collection of sessions could be minted into an NFT, which can be used to prove what you played.  You can sell it if you want.  Can be like a high stakes poker player selling their hands.

## Poker with quorum
everyone shuffles the deck by supplying random numbers that they will reveal later to determine the next set of cards.  If someone drops off the game, then the quorum votes them off the table as offline.  They can come back online by decrypting the shuffle info they supplied.

To deal out a card, everyone has to send a decrypt ?

Might still be the only way is to have a trusted dealer, and to pull the randomness from VRF or some other impartial source, plus have that randomness be used by multiple games so it couldn't ever be twisted one particular way.  So the dealer, being someone who receives a fee for completing a game, first shuffles the deck and submits each encrypted card slot on chain.  The dealers performance is analyzed continually to see if it is random, and were players kept from seeing the deck.  Could have a real deck, and televise the results ?

## Soulbinding
Can provide kyc services that can give you a token that verifies your age and residency, so gives you rights to play at some kinds of casinos.

## Direct path to dreamcatcher
Can set up the casino to directly invest in dreamcatcher packets.
Filter can be only for vetted QA.

## Polygon testnet
Offer freeplay using the polygon testnet.  Play version includes gambling on what tasks will win.  Play includes task simulation, or play gambling on real tasks.  Pay with credit card to have an account that records your activities on mainchain.

## Account management
Use a user account module so that we can do kyc and aml, plus manage signing keys, whilst presenting a web 2.0 interface, and do this as a service so that any venture can use them too.

## Gambling DEX using any assets
If someone with NFTs wants to provide a pool, then you can gamble your in game NFTs, or any other kind of NFT, to be able to rapidly multiply whatever you have, or to be able to stake it with gains, even for rare assets.

Phase 1 would be a base casino that allows pooling on the backend.  We would be genuinely free to play, as the other side of the deal is being taken by other crypto holders, and our contract is not controlled by us in any way.  

Phase2 is phoenixed losses going into tasks.  You could have lost any asset that a pool was made for, on any game that was plugged into the system.  Can configure cutover for once we have had our initial task funding paid back ?

Freeplay agents exist in a simulation of the future of the system, so we can study how everyone behaves in our simulations.

## General framework for rapid game construction
Generalized gambling contract so can rapidly make any game.  Supply a payout structure, and escrow agent, and a random source.

What is the difference between casino and crypto exchange licensing requirements ?

## Legal opinions needed:
1. do we need to be licensed anywhere
2. do we need kyc for people to play with crypto ?
3. is crypto considered a currency in each jurisdiction and are we therefore exempt from licensing in those jurisdictions ?

## NFTs as prizes to avoid being a casino
If you gamble on the roulette wheel, then your losses are encapsulated as a loss NFT against a task.
So it isn't funding directly, but rather an NFT that wraps up the act of gambling against the task.
If you pass the defund period, you get your money back ?
You are effectively buying the NFT, and it represents win or lose.
If you win, then the project gets more funds, if you lose, you

Bet $100 and lose and you get $100 of tokens and the project gets $100 of funding

Bet $100 and win and you get $200 of tokens and the projects gets $200 of funding

The difference I'm suggesting is the gambling pool is spread across all projects, you always lose in so far as you always get project tokens back, but if you win your project gets your gambling winnings and you get more tokens proportional to your winnings.  So if you play Roulette and hit 36, your project gets 36x your wager
