If you want to gamble, we offer a fair game, educational materials on how probability works, simulators, and an open API.  We thoroughly verify that children are not playing and we ensure people can afford to lose with proof of a higher deposit.

If you still want to play, we take your losses and we reinvest them in startups, which you can choose, where we vet those startups for quality, and yank funds based on poor performance.  Some of your funds go into the gambling float, which handles payouts when gamblers win.  This earns you money each time money goes thru it, so you do start to get your money back over time, but you cannot touch it until time has elapsed.

The deposits we require to prove you have funds can be used for anything else you like that isn't gambling, including small stocks investing and other things.

You cannot withdraw the phoenixed winnings directly, due to regulatory restrictions, but you can gamble them thru again, and you can withdraw anything you win.
