firstly, let people have email agents that handle all the email messaging to interact with businesses.

then have businesses able to process the inbound emails using these systems.

Ultimately, we want the businesses to publish their schedules and bookings online, in any form possible, so that we can all have programmatic access anyway.

so they either drown from ai generated email requests, or they start publishing the info people want anyway.

so if we deploy a system, it handles email responses, but it also provides an mcp server, rather than an email server, where it can use the dns records and determine if an mcp serevr is available and it just connects to that instead.
