if vice was used as a way to make you hone your skills in hard to practice areas, like threat making, bribery, lie detection, social graph navigation, mole detection.

Badge these things, like a badge for mole detection, and ratio of loss from the molehunt - how many innocent people were harmed in the hunt.

give pointers and feedback on your tone and tools, where the game helps you become better at your goals, like threats, timing of bribes, subtlety.

make it open tools game, so bots of any kind are available, and the game devs start you with the best tools they know of - it is a game about maximal tools by any means necessary, where you compete with intelligence overall, rather than any other rules of the game.

The tools will set their own price, due to tokens and what people charge for them.
