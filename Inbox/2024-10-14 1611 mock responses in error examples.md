When a thread has problems, we should be able to mock the tool calls that were made so that we can recreate it exactly, without any variance in the external system.

For instance if we are wondering why the reasoner loops a lot, we can recreate the tool calls that occurred easily, and then see what the reasoner does to try to induce a loop.
