Makes it super easy to do fuzzy times, and times you can't commit to but might be able to make something work.

Can also allow for trivial rescheduling, and other information leading in to the call.

Can help people build up knowledge bots before chatting, so when they land, they have everything in order, and the incoming meeting can run some bots to know what questions to ask and possibly get some answers out before hand.

Also kicks in the scheduling function any time during a chat.
