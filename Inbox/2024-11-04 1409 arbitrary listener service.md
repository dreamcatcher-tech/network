Be able to set up a service using any point to listen.

Then have something that parses the incoming bytes.

The goal is to transform it into a json function call.

So can set up smtp to listen directly, or bittorrent.

Once artifact triggers the listener, then the little listener code triggers whenever comms occur.

Then it gets turned into artifact land.

Can issue control systems back.

This could be simply docker listeners.
