People could run their own stuff on aws.
To do this, they would run a cloud formation template, and then deploy napps within it.  Currently there is a high maintenance cost due to the logic being hard to extricate out, and hard to test a range of functionality together.

This makes cloud slow to deploy.

This standadizes the environment.

We should offer people a one click solution to have their own execution environment.

Allow hybrids, or allow consensus.

If you run several different domains, you can join them in consensus.

You could choose to run your own environment as just a user ?

Isn't this what you get whenever you access dreamcatcher and sign up for an account ?

These terraform like templates and setups would be like offering drivers for different hardware configurations, so that we have a standard OS running atop it all.

The Standard Environment is able to run on many different types of hardware and cloud config, and can perform fitness testing on each one to know its performance metrics.

The standard environment is naturally multi user.

The CRM for example would choose to run their own deployment of the SE, with their own identity service attached to it.  They could have multiple tenants in it, but would probably just use the one.
