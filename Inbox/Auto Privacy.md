Any kind of record keeping system can benefit from automated differential privacy.

Any system used by multiple people can use the same mechanism to ensure a common language, with all terms referenced to a common dictionary.

Same mechanism as that which would search the company dictionary and propose auto links can be used to detect new nouns and suggest they be replaced with privacy keys.
Detecting dictionary words helps to ensure people are using the same language between each other, alerts on new topic emergence as a signal of innovaiton, and makes refactoring the names of things much easier since all usages of the noun are the same.

## Example
Using a CRM that is made public but the subjects have a right and expectation of being private.

When entering notes, we would detect a new noun and suggest that it is a name.  We would then auto generate a placeholder name from a configurable list, and create a link to a new chain.  
The new chain is private, and only those with view permissions can read it.  Public viewers would see only a chainId and nothing else.

We can do the same for images, if we want to put in placeholders that look similar.  These can be AI derived versions for fullness.

We can comb all entries using the same type of filtering as email filtering, where we have a list of allowed words.  
This also helps force us to keep writing simple and sane within the company, and pressures people to deduplicate their concepts.

## Extras
Using ML we may be able to suggest ways that can simplify whatever you are currently trying to write.  This should be aware of the word limitations and contents of the current dictionary.
