If each client could happily see inside the deployment chain, and provided there was no private info in there, as in all users are represented by guids, then being viewable by all should be fairly easy to do.

Collect and publish summary metrics of the platform, so people can make their own decisions about reliability of our offering.

As an anonymous user, all your data is available to everyone else to see.

In this way, the system chain is like a big CRM, where each customer is an active user of the shared resources offered by the system.

Mutiple deploy chains could cooperate to reach consensus on the user or org chains, making them move forwards with resilience.

So if the ACL was handled inside the engine, then from system chain, we should be able to get access to do anything else.

System chain would be a blank repo with an io.json file that only allowed access to some particular pubkeys.

Pierce would need to be signed so we know it comes from the users device.
