To walk all the children seems to always be slow.
Diffing can give us what changed rapidly, but to know about state changes requires the tree to be written, and querying the prior latest for a given channel.

Is the new condensed block format able to give us a way to know rapidly if the hash of the latest PulseLink for a given channel changed in between the hash of some prior Pulse ?
