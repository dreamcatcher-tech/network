librechat handles mobile, tuning, staying up to date.

we should be able to copy this verbatim.

keep one folder that is a canonical copy of the chat

Make the chats be in a frame, so they can be completely isolated.

We should be able to copy over the code, and then have codex make versions for us that work as we want ?

basically they would keep tuning the project, and updating it, and we would just update our code as required ?

to check bugs, we'd see if they were present in their demos, then look to fix them for them.

they handle all the pretty integrations, like search results.

maintain a list of the features we want to remove, and keep this in a doc of translations.
this is part of the rules the agent uses to know how to surgically cut bits out.

We piggy back on top, having hard won code that we just slightly modify each time, to achieve what we want.

Their problems are our problems.

They will keep riding high and solving untold numbers of bugs, we just inherit.

There isn't a more free spirited project around.
