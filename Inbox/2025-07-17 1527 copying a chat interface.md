librechat handles mobile, tuning, staying up to date.

we should be able to copy this verbatim.

keep one folder that is a canonical copy of the chat

Make the chats be in a frame, so they can be completely isolated.

We should be able to copy over the code, and then have codex make versions for us that work as we want ?

basically they would keep tuning the project, and updating it, and we would just update our code as required ?

to check bugs, we'd see if they were present in their demos, then look to fix them for them.

they handle all the pretty integrations, like search results.

maintain a list of the features we want to remove, and keep this in a doc of translations.
this is part of the rules the agent uses to know how to surgically cut bits out.

We piggy back on top, having hard won code that we just slightly modify each time, to achieve what we want.

Their problems are our problems.

They will keep riding high and solving untold numbers of bugs, we just inherit.

There isn't a more free spirited project around.

or, bail, and just limp on with our custom front end ?

Or snippet out just the bits that handle the streaming and rendering ?

I am supposed to be getting transcludes working.  This would delay that.
Then we need innovations, and finally agents.  This would delay that.
But it would in the meantime give use a very stable, high quality, pleasant to use interface.

However it has all of the features we need, 

So where are the cut points in this library ?
we could just take the chat view piece, and then leave the rest ?
or pull the rest in later ?

The key is to touch it as lightly as possible, and just silently / surgically snip bits off it, and inject our own backend stuff in there.

Making librechat be a frame is probably the cleanest way to keep it under wraps.
So we would have a repo, that made a branch that was our working branch, and we periodically cleaned things up, and documented the changes we were making to translate to our use case.

If we simply recreate the entire server side api using artifact, then we have within this system a fully featured user management app ?
And because of their incentives, we stay aligned with them almost fully ?

permissions turn features on and off easily.

So if we changed nothing, and just provided routes using artifact ?
then, if we used frames to give extended features ?

we should be able to mimick mongodb fairly easily, but we would like to expose more functions, like history.

we could run their project as a server too, and then replace the mongodb instance with our own.

Or use their exact project, but add repos in ?

Rather than trying to snip librechat at the data-provider junction, it might be easier to lift off its UI components.  Pull of just a component at a time, and build up our own view into it ?

Or, persist at undercutting the server side, and presenting a neutered version of the app, with some key aspects overridden.

They will always work on making a nice conformant UI for chatbots, which we can ride.
bugs in the interface will always be their problem, which we can push out to them.

could snip out some of the hooks ?

replace the data service, so that it uses artifact to make these calls ?
We might be able to avoid syncing the whole repo down, and instead, we make calls on demand with the client ? or do the sync, but high prioritize the queries directly made, so that responsiveness is improved.

read each file in the librechat-data-provider package and check that they all use the data-service.
read each file in the client/src/data-provider and see if this is the insertion point ?

or, we could skip the syntax highlighting, and just move on with our own stuff ?
or just copy how they do syntax highlighting and chat display ?

if we make our own shim package, that is imported in the client as an api compatible drop in for librechat-data-provider then we can switch out this one thing from the front end, and now all the service calls go thru us.

Another junction point is to run their own server, but replace mongodb with our own db.  Issue is, now, to run the app, you need a server side app as well as artifact running.

so we would wrap the whole app in an ArtifactProvider, and handle our own sign in flows, then 

so we could either be a patch over the top of the data-service package, or we could be a separate package that is imported separately ?

It looks like, all we need to do, is modify the data-service.ts file and sit over the top of that.

would be really nice to use the ai-sdk to handle the messaging and tool calling ?

but we only need like, two providers off the bat - a pattern may emerge for the others.
we could probably do that, and just translate it on the client side into something they expect ?

request needs to be modified to handle the token refresh.  This would be handled purely by privy lib code.

we could use the routes they use as the filesystem paths that we store all the data on.
like shared messages are at `/api/share/share-id`

If we synced down the whole user repo, then our data-service queries could be just straight up reading from the filesystem.  We could present it as an opfs filesystem, so it stays at the latest value, making interactions easy ?

list of other candidates:
## open web ui
no because it runs python on the backend

## lobechat

## lobehub/ui
https://ui.lobehub.com/components/chat/chat-list
ui with nice chat components in it.
might be especially spliceable since they offer offline db in browser or server postgres, so we might insert ourselves as a 3rd switch.

## lobechat conversion
If we ran the nextjs server, this is the path of least resistance to get up and running.
then the filesystem is the git stuff.
the execution remains in the nextjs realm, and it just writes the data to git as a filestore, with no execution.
then how do we execute napps ?  This could be done via tool calls ?

This means that the desktop app needs no extra replacements either, and it just works, and only its database operations are altered in any way.

replacing the nextjs logic seems hard, and not really necessary.

many featuers can be disabled with feature flags.
getting frames working seems the crucial step.

burden on keeping in sync with their db schemas, particularly when they migrate or update, is hard.  so if we keep things running using browser dbs, and just leave everything the same as theirs, that is the least amount of effort.  Then we add in hooks to write to our own storage when relevant things occur, like the chats increase or something.

because file goes to s3, that might suit us for files anyway, easily.  we might be able to hook that one directly ?
so hauling in chats as context might be hard ?
repopulating the db based on git might be hard ?

to intercept at the app level, we would have to intercept everything in the src/services dir
or intercept at the fetch level, but then making an api compatible backend in huge.

would be nice to just lift off the front end.

running their docker image would be the easiest ? possibly then just intercept the postgres calls ?  or insert a frontend of our own ?

we could use their api as the way to do agentic chat calls from our backend.
So our backend is really about agents.
take the pg-lite version, and then gradually peel of functions that go into our backend ?

docker images
- pg-lite seems up to date
- lobe-chat seems outdated
