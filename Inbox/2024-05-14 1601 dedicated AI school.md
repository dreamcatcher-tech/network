>[!danger] Depends: 

Help parents find each other locally.
Monitors children, and gives realtime report cards back.
Hire tutors that can ensure the curriculum is followed.
They would be expert practictioners in it ?

Maybe all we need is supervisor parents, who get paid by the collective.

The kids need to have other peers that are going thru the same program as them tho.

Should be able to transplant round the world easily.

Plus can VR session with remote students in this way.

Really just need a big warehouse with net.

If the school could be completely mobile, then we could relocate to any building at any time and perform effective education.  Could be the back of a van, then go to lots of different locations and learn about those locations.
