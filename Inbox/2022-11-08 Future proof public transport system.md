Cards replaced by cellphones, with an NFC standin card, capable of using credit cards directly.

Installers should be general purpose computers, so they can be upgraded in the future.

Use transient payments with cellphones.

Provide an open platform for external people to integrate on top of, to provide apps dedicated to making the platform better, and to integrate the platforms services into their own apps.

Dashboards should be modelling every passenger, and detecting signs of discomfort, such as bus timetable misaligned with ferry timetable - minutes waiting at destination.  When a service is late, can estimate how long each passenger waited.  Dashboard up total minutes waited, people delayed count, people on time count.

Use this to model system tension - those routes that should change to better meet desires.

Future proof the system by making it dynamic - consumers should us an app to know what the timetable is, allowing the timetable to be dynamically generated based on many parameters.
