I should be able to have a transcription go in and then the machine would check what I said against previous things in the knowledge base so that it could clean up the text but also detect when something I said sounds amiss or wrong or off-topic. It would then raise these issues as possible transcription errors, reducing the amount of time that I have to spend to spot these errors.

Furthermore, it should be able to handle me speaking in a relatively unstructured way or with common corrections or backtracking or being able to undo what I just said once I realize what's happened.

Lastly, while I'm talking it should be pulling up relevant information to help me as I speak.
