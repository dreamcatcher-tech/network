As a standard, an api gateway tool needs to include some api mocks so users can make mock responses to it easily, using a tool like msw.

The mocks need to integrate LLMs to generate realistic responses.

They should consume an api standard, so we can use structured outputs to make generally correct data, albeit mocked.
