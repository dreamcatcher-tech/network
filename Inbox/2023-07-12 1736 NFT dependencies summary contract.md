Be able to mint NFTs that represent complete control of a child NFT, or that gather them together in some way that requires no opt in for the child.

Lets you mint a collection or a bundle.

Used to make a gantt chart.

Can act as a proxy where any commands sent to anything can be sent as tho they were a holder of the NFT.  Allow some vote mechanisms where the votes are NFT based too.
