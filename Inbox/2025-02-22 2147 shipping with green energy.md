If very small drones took about a car load of cargo different places by sea, but they used entirely green means like wind turbines and were totally automated, they might be more cost effective and have similar times than commercial shipping.

They should be considerably cheaper.

If they could foil, that would be the fastest, but speed shouldn't be that important, like its was 4 days at high speed or 10 at slow, does it matter that much ?

Rocking could charge up energy storage.

10m tall foils might make things faster ?
