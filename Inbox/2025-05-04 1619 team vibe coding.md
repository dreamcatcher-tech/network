Being able to have anybody spin up or fork and then start trying to create applications and systems in a way that when they hit areas the errors are being pushed back to a pool for anyone listening AIs can help out in the background, but also you can talk to your friends about it and they can see what you were trying to do from the areas. The AIs are summarizing the areas so they're trying to see what you're doing. The bots are making alternative views based on what they think you're doing, some of which you might like. They're just happening in the background all the time. Sometimes you can leave it running overnight and you come back and it's solved. Could even be solved by another person that you don't know, sort of like on Github. The excitement you get when someone fixes a problem for you, but it's like your whole app now works. The ambient attribution gets around the fact people trying to hide their stuff so they can still make money off it. You know we can safely remove that, and so everyone's happy when you solve something because you win - you think you're going to get paid, they think they're going to get paid a little bit. Plus people naturally have an inner joy for making things work.
