Provide an interactive video platform that has these service options:
1. Use peers
2. Use our paid dedicate service
3. Use a public spot service
4. Supply from your peers to the spot service
5. Supply from your dedicated servers to our dedicated or spot service

Additionally you can self supply your own amplification servers which can use high bandwidth to amplify the connections.

Or, you can sell your excess bandwidth to others.
