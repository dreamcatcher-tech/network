we don't want to block what the DAO can be interacted with, so we simply provide it as a git repo with some file structures.

we then deploy a smart contract that can have a git commit added, provided someone pays for it.

these can back up until someone pushes thru one, that has a payment, and then the block hash goes back into the repo, and can be checked with tooling.
