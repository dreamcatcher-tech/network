Take the files and index out any content, put them into vectors to make the content searchable intelligently, store a large amount of data cheaply, whilst being searchable and changeable by AI.

Set up some processing to make thumbnails of various kinds.

Agents on local machines can keep in sync with the B2 store, and can provide a local network fetch ability for faster access and another backup tier.

Local agents can cache the versions each other used last, or that were pinned, so you can load up for a plane journey, and can also load up amongst peers, so several machines can store a set of files in their own swarm.  AI can balance who should have what file.  Can be plugged in to your calendar and knows what you got madd about missing last time, so copies those things.

Taking the git repo with you can help with content, so you can talk about the content without having everything with you.

If we had an electron app, then we can install this one thing, then have full access to all our library of jitters.
