Different governments and international bodies have guidelines that set boundaries:

- **Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS)** in the US: Provides detailed frameworks on fair pricing.
    
- **FAR (Federal Acquisition Regulation)**: Outlines principles on allowable costs, profit, and transparency in procurement.
    
- **NATO procurement guidelines**: Often influence pricing standards for equipment or services provided to member and partner states, such as Ukraine.
