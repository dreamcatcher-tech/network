Replace a central company ID system, since the orb hardware is much cheaper than any other system, and it has extra security guarantees as it mistrusts everything.  Has very little operator cost and maintenance, and replacements are readily available.  Then use secure compute chips in peoples phones to guarantee confidential computing.

Plus could add networking reinforcement, like if two phones are near each other, and neither detected anything strange, then probably the bond is still good.

Beats any in house ID access system, and is cheaper.

Could scan a whole population, like Vanuatu in about a year if you had 100 orbs.

Huge benefit is no form filling to signup or sign in.  Each time anyone wants a service, like hospital, they scan in using the orb.
