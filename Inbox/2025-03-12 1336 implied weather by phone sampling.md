People don't go outside when its raining, or they will say the words "it's raining" - we should be able to use this as our weather collection system, and then aggregate it so we can present a wisdom of the crowds type output.

We don't have to be right, but we can just say what the crowds have said.

Plus we can let people stake their reputation on what the weather will be, and they earn payout based on what it is.

Subscribers pay a small amount, like a few dollars a month, and then if the forecasters are wrong, they get money back, or the forecasters get the money.  "correct weather or your money back"

Allow people to purchase 'weather insurance' where they get compensated if the predictions are wrong.  This can cause forecasters to pay special attention to these requests, and gather extra data, so they can take on the bet.
