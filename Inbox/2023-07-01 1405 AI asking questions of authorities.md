If a general chatbot was put in front of the Dreamcatcher so that people could ask it questions, then it should be able to keep a running tally of questions that it felt like it needed some more clarity on.

It should be able to summarize similar type questions, and present them to an authority, so that it can have answers that it can assimilate and use for future questions.

In this way it acts as a broker between mass clients and few authority figures.

Can train it to listen to some speakers in a channel more than others, so it can learn what they have to say, incorporate, and repeat back the concepts that they correct people on.  Like a discord bot that learns from a few key actors.
