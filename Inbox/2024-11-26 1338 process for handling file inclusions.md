All types of requests that involve files can be converted into a standard form, and can be reasoned thru.

For each file that is mentioned, see if we need the whole file, or if we should preprocess it.

Convert into actual data, vs helpful data.

Run a conversion to get the request into a more straightforward form, with some files, and some RAG material that is summarised.  But do not get the RAG from embeddings, use full model calls to generate it.

For each other mention, see if the user might be referring to some other file by assosciation, so we need to pull that in too.

Consider the whole conversationw hen converting the history general form that is needed.
