If the whole thing was theorized about using interfaces only, and some basic mock implementations, then seems easier to fulfill the interfaces with something at run time ?

The design of the interfaces allows considering how to think about things as inherited concepts, like how the local fs methods get increasingly expanded until they represent local, process, branch, and remote repo versions of the function calls.
