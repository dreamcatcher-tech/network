a browser that is coco aware and can attest it is talking to a server process that is running inside a coco.  so more than SSL, it has a `confidential` light that flicks on once it knows it browsing to a coco.

another way to do this is to make the coco browse out, so all the traffic goes via the coco in a proxy config, or having a browser run on the coco, and stream back.
