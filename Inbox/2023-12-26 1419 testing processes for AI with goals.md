If there is a multiturn script, then if the first turn gives a response that is already off script, the rest of the responses will surely be wrong also.

So we want to score similarity of output as a way of storing a snapshot ?

Or, we can continue on with the script, but flag it as orange since an earlier error has occured, but we will continue with the rest of the script for completeness, as being able to see how later responses occured might be useful ?
