And, does it lose us the ability to make systems rapidly ? have we simply moved the complexity somewhere else ?

How can we run these tests in the platform itself ?

It seems impossible to get the bots to generate a complete bug free system on their own.  They do not know business rules anyway, but we can generate a system and an upgrade based on rule setting and changing.  

But, we need a place to inject human guidance of the systems, and at the test level seems one such place.  This is required so we can affirm the behaviour of the system.

Declaring the system and testing the system are two very different things.
