What we could start to do is analyze the amount of times we're getting interrupted and we could change the prefix padding and silence duration as well as the voice sensitivity thresholds to attempt to break out of resonance as well as interjecting some encouraging sounds or words to indicate to the human that they should speak and we will listen. When we come back in from that sensitive time we would check that we heard them correctly before proceeding.

Color code the device so that it shows when it has backed off its VAD and silence settings.

It can be commanded to speed up and slow down, but can also detect when it is jumping in too much.

Also display its tempo and playback speed settings.

Can go into modes, like wait for instruction confirmation mode.
