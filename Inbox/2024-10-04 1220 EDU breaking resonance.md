What we could start to do is analyze the amount of times we're getting interrupted and we could change the prefix padding and silence duration as well as the voice sensitivity thresholds to attempt to break out of resonance as well as interjecting some encouraging sounds or words to indicate to the human that they should speak and we will listen. When we come back in from that sensitive time we would check that we heard them correctly before proceeding.
