stuck overflow.

if all the things bots did were put in a pool, then whenever an error is found, we should be able to search for things like it, and find a solution out of there.

we would process them and map and link them to make it easier to consume.

so whenever bots have a problem, or humans and bots have a problem, we should be able to rapidly find the other runs.  This is only possible in a system where it can share and preserve and recreate runs exactly.
