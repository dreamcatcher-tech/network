there is a cycle called the Kolb experiential cycle which we should run to extract transferrable knowledge out of everything the bots do.

Concrete Experience → Reflective Observation → Abstract Conceptualisation → Active Experimentation ⇄

further, we should map links between this knowledge in a graph, so that bots can walk these graphs and can have good solid ground truth.

these systems should happen internally to the model anyway, as it leaps thru the previous validated knowledge, and also uncovers and corrects errors.

Anyone should be able to add or correct, and a curator decides to let in new info or not.
