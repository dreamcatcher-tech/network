Inception test: you are in the interface, chatting to the machine. Then you ask for changes to your very own interface. It then presents these changes in a window, invites you to click around an experiment and ask for your feedback. Once you are happy, it then undergoes its own UI testing using an operator. Once it has passed all these tests, it then deploys it. There would be a bulletproof, fail-safe rollback the UI button so you could escape out of it.

As you start to use it, it would discover the faults automatically and fix them in a way no different to us because we are just another user in this system.

We might make the web page have easy handles within the page so that the layout can be adjusted by an LLM that is trained or prompted to modify certain things that are common to be adjusted. This would make it easier for people to get it right first time. 

The bots might also be generating multiple versions of whatever you say, with multiple interpretations. It might look at what you do and how you use the system, making proactive changes to make things easier (e.g., reducing the number of clicks or the amount of time spent using the mouse). 

As other members start to hotspot use different features, we would take advice from them and potentially roll out modifications to your framework or your choice of UI configuration. 

Along with the design of the page to have easily programmatically configurable settings, it should also have a common language of areas or components as being used so that we can do heat mapping to determine how different features are being used en masse.
