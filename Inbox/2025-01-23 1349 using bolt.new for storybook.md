The idea is that using Bolt.new, if we could edit components as a storybook, it might be easier to get the bot to update a specific component than it is to update the system as a whole. Now, additionally, we could get i1pro to design the props or interfaces to the system, and so we can let these UI bots that are fast and chatty do what they're good at in terms of UI. But then, i1pro keeps the architecture on track.
