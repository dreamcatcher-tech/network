It should be able to generate theories to investigate, in parallel.

Once it has these theories, it goes about testing against them.

Each time it does another iteration on a particular plan, it looks at what the other runners have done, and rechecks its thinking.

It would be trying to change the codebase to get a better perf in a benchmark, or solve a specific bug.

It can start to formulate a plea for help online, which can be published and updated immediately, as it works, so that others know what its working on, or can see the results of attempts that came before.  This can be used to estimate cost, or figure out if it should fail early.
