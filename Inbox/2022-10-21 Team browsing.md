Currently I have no connection with my team when I browse the internet.  My team being all those people that think the same as me when I'm looking at a particular topic.

For example, when browsing for solutions to code problems, some sites have annoying pop ups for sign ups, or advertising.  My team would have flagged those as not the answer, and not worth going to, or extracted the value from those pages and modified them as required.

I would also like to pass comment on web pages that I browsed, and stash the data for offline, and share with others.
