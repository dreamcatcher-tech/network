Sometimes you need a specific prompt, but some time you want to reuse some existing ones.

The existing ones might be assembled, where different components are pulled together.

If we had a repo of them, or a napp, then we could refer to them by hash or name or something, and then they would get pulled in.

If there was a napp that was actual prompts, you could import it in code, so the prompt is auto assembled ?
