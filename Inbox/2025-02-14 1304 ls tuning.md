cache the ls lookups based on an oid.

allow ls to be like a readtree function, where we pass in a tree id.

meta() calls could be done starting with an oid rather than the top of the commit stack.

each tree read should start at the oid of the tree it came from, since we know that already.

listDirCached could store calls that were made, and use the oid to make the next call down.
if higher listings hav

overall, the tree should be cached, so that each call would rely on the parent chain, which is what git has to do anyway, so we might as well wait and only do each call once, which will be significantly faster.
So we basically develop our own drill down logic, and store this cache possibly against the commitscope object, as long as it exists, we'll keep using it.
