Help is a different kind of package manager, where it is about an invocation, not a capability.

It is how to call something, not how to get something that will be called a certain way - it is function invocation.  It is a collection of function invocation parameters, tested to have reliable outputs, indexed by the problems they are trying to solve, to make it more accessible to an AI trying to solve problems on the fly.
