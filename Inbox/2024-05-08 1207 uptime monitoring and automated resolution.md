We can use deno cron to run checks periodically.
The results we can commit back to repos, or just include them in data locally.

Used to see if static pages are being served correctly, and see if the apps behind them are functioning correctly.  Can monitor the chain api connection separately to the page, and then coupled with the page.

Deploying commits should be managed by this system, where it makes a ghstatic page, and tests it thoroughly before promoting it.
