Increasingly the only way that works appears to be using packets to do everything.
Once this initial system was set up and operating, then we would be able to attract traditional investment in vehicles everyone understands.

People could purchase shares in the primary packets we are producing.

Start a small vehicle that can take on private investment that then goes and uses the packet model to build more stuff.  We would not have to compromise anything with this vehicle, multiple vehicles could exist, 

Otherwise we will keep having people customize what they think they want out of the company, rather than being pure packet.

Packet is the purpose of the dreamcatcher, and so we should be using it asap.  We should not allow any other investment other than via packets.

Building a labour market then becomes a packet task, and so investment in that market gets a cut of the market.

Cut of services vs software: We can set the initial labour market cut that goes to the platform, and then can make that be governed by fairness algos later.  We can manually control it until such point as the AI is online, then hand over.  If we cut 2% then we can at least demonstrate revenue.

Taking a cut of funding ?  Funders should have to pay something for the software that got used.  It is fair for them to do so, so we shall start with a configured amount.

Pubco trying to convert shareholder funds into valuable and reused software assets that attract royalties for the company.
