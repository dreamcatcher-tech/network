seems yes

but if a watcher joined slightly after, they would be abandoned there, looking at the view ?
should we need something else to start the view again ?
is the view permanently redirecting, or only partially ?

so a loop if one agent sent you to another agent which sent you back, and you'd just cycle around ?
the router should have this loop detection maybe ?
