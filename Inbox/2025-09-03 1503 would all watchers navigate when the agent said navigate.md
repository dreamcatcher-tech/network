seems yes

but if a watcher joined slightly after, they would be abandoned there, looking at the view ?
should we need something else to start the view again ?
is the view permanently redirecting, or only partially ?

so a loop if one agent sent you to another agent which sent you back, and you'd just cycle around ?
the router should have this loop detection maybe ?

what about turning their mics on ?

maybe following or navigating is a session setting, where the viewers can toggle that ?

have the concept of a primary viewer, so this is the one whose hardware is connected ?
