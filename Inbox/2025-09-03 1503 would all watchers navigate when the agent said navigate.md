seems yes

but if a watcher joined slightly after, they would be abandoned there, looking at the view ?
should we need something else to start the view again ?
is the view permanently redirecting, or only partially ?

so a loop if one agent sent you to another agent which sent you back, and you'd just cycle around ?
the router should have this loop detection maybe ?

what about turning their mics on ?

maybe following or navigating is a session setting, where the viewers can toggle that ?

have the concept of a primary viewer, so this is the one whose hardware is connected ?

the face could ssh into the other agent and present the face back in this manner ?

or we just add a token that shows the redirect origin and all the places it visits along the way, so that if redirect finds a loop, then we come in with a tool call to break it.

having multiple mics come in should be fine - it's all just hardware, and we can connect as much as we want.
Seems an easy way for everyone to have a voice call, all hook up mics to the agent.
