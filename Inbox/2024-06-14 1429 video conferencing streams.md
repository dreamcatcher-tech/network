Flick the mic into meeting mode.
Then everyone in the channel can hear what you're saying.
Your stream is spliced off and is available privately, which you can opt in to sharing.

Your transcription is put into the chat window.

Use an av overlay service like cloudflare to ensure the streams all communicate, or use webrtc.

Upload parts of the stream to your repo.

Transcribe happens live, on each chunk, using activity detection.

Then the chat is intelligently parsed, and built on by participants.
People can turn off the shared mic and expand on ideas in the chat.
