resource prompts, can embed resouces into the prompt directly as text ?
so they would be reified client side ?

if we make artifact be an mcp server, then we can use those mcp calls to populate ui elements for handling transcludes and files, and then generate prompts client side.

if transclude itself was a chat, and you can use that as an mcp server to modify the transclusion context, then you can use it manually, or you can carry that with you on the clipboard.
