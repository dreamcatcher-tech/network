If main was kept pristine, and then all activity occured on a parallel branch, which periodically pulled from main, then we could do simple and reliable merges.

If we want to PR up, then we should do that with a squash merge, to remove all the noise of calculation from what we want to PR.

Until we do that, we can just clobber in the meantime.

Sorting out conflicts and doing our own handling of differences seems key.
