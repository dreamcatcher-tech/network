We should be able to make a version of how There. Knows how to save files. To a branch where those files look exactly like, you know, sitting in notebook. And so we could take an exist repo and then basically make clean AI generated notes in there where all the threads in that are kept separate in a separate branch since they represent Data that should be filtered out of the main stuff because the threads represent all the noise as to how something got there. Now we can have a scavenging process that extracts everything possible from the threads and make sure we didn't miss anything. But the threads are really kept separate from the refined data that is presented as the core knowledge base. Where that core knowledge base is in in that into agents and used to respond to queries. It may be subjected to votes and other such consensus mechanisms where multiple people are involved.

IT then lets us use the obsidian tool to navigate, and can be a plugin for obsidian.
