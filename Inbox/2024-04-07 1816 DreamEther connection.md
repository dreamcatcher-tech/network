If we were to represent ethereum assets inside dreamcatcher, then people could move things around faster ?

Do some extra money saving features, like uniswap batching, AI powered trading bots that batch tx on ethereum, tx squashing where a bunch of tx are squeezed into eth all at once ?

So if you use Artifact to control your eth assets, you can benefit from lower price swaps, and more functional control using AI intelligence.
