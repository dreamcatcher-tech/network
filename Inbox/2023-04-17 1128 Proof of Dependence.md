Many high value actions occur every second using signatures - new packages published to npm, git commits, high value community members sign in to twitter, ssl pages are signed and served.  Each of these actions carries weight in the network of people that depend upon them, and also each action carries repurcussions for behaving badly.

All such actions should be usable to assert the correctness of some global state, like a top level payment ledger.  You could asset only your part of it, and sign just the merkle tree that pertains to you, which is to say that you haven't checked the rest of it, but the parts that you care about, they are accurately reflected in this top level pulse.

This correctness can provide a ledger that is used for lookup of things like "latest version of the linux kernel" to "account balance of this person".
