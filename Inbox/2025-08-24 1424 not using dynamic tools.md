perhaps finding an agent based on a certain toolset is better ?
then the agent gets tasked in pure natural language and it can optionally call on the context of the caller (or not) and then it gives the results back.

that might be better than switching between tools rapidly ?

so the tool choice is less rigid, but it makes a burnden for many agents.
ideally the agents would adapt to the task at hand, if they notice they are failing and it is within budget, they should spin up alternative processes.

this is good because century long tasks would have the same interface as isntant tasks, they just have different budgets.
