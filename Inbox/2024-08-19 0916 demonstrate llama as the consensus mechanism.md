Show how a piece of software can use this ai to run repeatable and verifyable ai outputs.

Then raise cap to build a public chain version.  Show the utility using the stripe version, and show how we can get the same utility but truly decentralized, with repeatable AI models.

Only some ai models are compatible to be run like this.

Show path to doing training at large scale where the training data has the side effect of maintaining an asset ledger.

Also running the ai inference has side effect of running an asset ledger.  The asset ledger is just the side effect of generalized computation.

Do a chain raise that uses packets, with clients paying for work to be done.
Have an on chain version of ambient attribution that determines who gets what.

Once can demonstrate what such a chain looks like, and its utility, and have ai based explainers that can take in feedback and questions, then we are ready to create the public version.

The dreamcatcher currency would be something that holds all the unclaimed funds, and attempts to trade them so their value goes up but is stable.  If you trade in the currency directly, it is like a slow growth stable coin, or stable growth coin, where its trades are AI based.
