Eg: making modules for [[2023-02-23 1053 Models for Satoshi Island|Satoshi Island]]

We would generate and test different iterations.

Some products are better at this than others, since products in the field can deliver telemetry, and some products can be upgraded modularly.

If home were made out of panels with distinct interfaces, then each panel could be innovated on separately.  If standard cheap automated quality control was enacted, such as measuring the joints of the panel using a touch probe with a video feed, then we could trust the mfg to a much wider range.  Anyone with the touch probe and some local suppliers could become a supplier.

Being a data org offers richer engagement and participation with customers.  Customers feel safe that they can always get spare parts made locally, cheaply.  They know that their data is rewarded, and that improvements are being made based on continual data gathering of actual usage.

Pricing is transparent so we know nobody is getting ripped off, or tricked into some supplier lock.

Spares form a digital marketplace where people can continually bid on parts in other units so everything is always live on the market.  Services to help with the home are always open, and training material readily available, plus smarts ensure the quality of work is high.  Lets people upgrade by selling off pieces of their overall solution and purchasing modules better suited to their needs without a complete replacement.  Upgradeable prefab housing.

Each proposed change in design goes thru FEA unit tests.  Then some test units are made and tested for coherence with the FEA test results.

Markets like kickstarter are easily navigated by the base model in 3D - the 3D model provides a map that links to different projects that aim to improve different parts of the system in parallel, independently.

Purpose of the network is locally sourced mfg for speed, price, and carbon.
