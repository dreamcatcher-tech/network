We should instead concentrate on consensus.

So we can have loosely reliable storage, but use consensus to do the calculations twice.

Each addition of of a consensus member increases the reliability.

So then, fussing around with object storage and consistency should be minimized, as the future is local non redundant disks.

> Every layer of resilience that goes atop the raw hardware is wasted complexity

Local servers with disks that are as reliable as the raw hardware, and the cpus and servers as reliable as their hardware, with the resilience provided by 

Any form of resilience is the supply of a redundancy count increase, and will always require all dimensions of compute to enact - compute, network, and storage.  So it is cleaner to make redundancy of all of these things as a unit of redudnant computer, and not try to tuck layers of these things emulating single dimensions, like storage redundancy.

It's also more purely measured, as the calculation of redundancy is simple.
