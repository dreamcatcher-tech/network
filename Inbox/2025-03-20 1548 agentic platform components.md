These could be built out of naps, where the naps provide React-based components that can be assembled to provide the elements of the Agentic platform. 

such example would be the tool creator where you could browse any of the NPM registries or Erlang registries pick the language that you wanted, then turn it into a tool. Now if there was already a conversion of this thing done already, you might want to stick with that. You can publish your NAPs in the public registry of which you can choose any version you want. You can use multiple versions concurrently or you can keep them private. 

It might be easier to talk about the name of the mount point for an agent in terms of the job that each agent will do based on its topology (like a relay agent is different from a filter agent is different from a routing agent). To talk about it is you'd say that you'd put a switch in the network or a processor in the network or a router or you'd insert a team in the network.

Names for the location of an agent in the graph:
- booth
- chamber
- portal
## Topology arrangements
- router - chooses where to send messages
- processor - takes messages in and passes them on, possibly filtering
- fan in / fan out
- IO - takes input and output from external sytems, like email or databases or api calls
