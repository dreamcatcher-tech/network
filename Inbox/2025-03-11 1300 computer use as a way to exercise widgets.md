can be done as a help system where the user can ask for help on how to navigate a particular widget, or if the answer to a question involves a widget, then the operator could be asked to enact it for the user. 

very useful in development and testing of the widgets to make sure that they behave in the correct way without having to build a complicated storybook. Because we can run the tests in parallel using these models which can exercise them like a human would. 

This exact same model can take advantage of using a hosted browser to do some browsing on your behalf.

we can use fly.io to offer containerized environments where an agent can experiment and do whatever it likes. 

The key is being able to have a very burstable, highly scalable system that we just simply lean on the infrastructure of others to provide. We use the AIs to build the system and then we provide scale by leaning on other elastic pricing models and just keep iterating from there. And then share our revenue with anyone else who wanted to contribute because that's a more responsive, innovative model than trying to do it ourselves and hope to keep control of it.

It does seem that the likes of cursor and others will all get taken out in one way or another because they need to do rapid, extreme pivots to stay on top as the competition heats up and the space changes direction as it matures and comes into focus on what we can and can't do.
