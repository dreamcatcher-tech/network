If I want to upload a detailed document, then the popup window would be a rich text editor ?

The prompt should maybe not be a rich text editor ?  Or maybe it could be but with only limited controls.  This means that transcription can show uncertain words too.

Idea is to get your info in to HAL and THEN start working on it, otherwise it might get lost and we can't do any ai enhancements on it when its in the prompt.
