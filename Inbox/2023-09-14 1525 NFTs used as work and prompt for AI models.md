With the prompts being valuable, and the LLM compute being expensive, seems the perfect thing to bundle up into an NFT.  The contents is put forwards as a header with an auto QA that merely checks formatting and other minor automated checks, then funding is put into the packet to cover the cost of the compute, then the solutions from LLM providers are added as solutions, and consensus used in QA to decide when the packet is solved.  QA can be configured to require multiple congruent solutions.

Funds are then released to the solution providers, who can be anyone, and provide all the input params and the output, so that others can verify it.
