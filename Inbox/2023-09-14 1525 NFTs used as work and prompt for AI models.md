With the prompts being valuable, and the LLM compute being expensive, seems the perfect thing to bundle up into an NFT.  The contents is put forwards as a header with an auto QA that merely checks formatting and other minor automated checks, then funding is put into the packet to cover the cost of the compute, then the solutions from LLM providers are added as solutions, and consensus used in QA to decide when the packet is solved.  QA can be configured to require multiple congruent solutions.

Funds are then released to the solution providers, who can be anyone, and provide all the input params and the output, so that others can verify it.  

The NFTs prove who made the prompt, and the solutions prove the calculation, and provide a competitive marketplace.

The marketplace can be set up to consume the idle capacity of everyone who is running their own models locally.  These machines are very expensive to run, and so if you can cram the GPU at maximum, then you can offset the cost of running and possibly turn a profit, so you would prioritize your own workloads at a steep discount, but you would also be able to burst at market rates.

This marketplace can probably be set up now, without our chain in the middle, just using docker images that get executed and guarantee isolation.
