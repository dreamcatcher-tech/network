map out all wineries to figure out who are potential clients of vinsight.

basically for any thing you want to sell, we should be able to get exact forecast, and we can know what the market is without having to guess - we know because we counted every single thing.

also keep it up to date, and continually crawl.

stack rank targets, to see who is next in line.
