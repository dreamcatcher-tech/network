We can take that user ID as proven, and can require a signature of the key for every action.

This could be actually a transaction that costs gas, since we are going to run some hosted stuff.

This should post to a market that allows participants to opt to run the job.

This makes their keys legitimately their own, in a way we cannot yet do.

It also gives them instant access to crypto payment rails, without much knowledge, and they can be guided by AI assistants.

So we could almost completely split out the auth from our own website ?
Or make a web host use an ecosystem auth, so the hoster is separate from the auth ?

Basically if we, at least architecturally, reduce identity down to a public key and proof of a private key, then our users are genuinely protected, but also our host becomes significantly simpler.
