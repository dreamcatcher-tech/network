Then make AI calls to use the help that it does, but post process the result to load up the help file itself, (or help files) and then return those, to save the load step from the goalie.

Can specify a post processing command that runs after termination of the AI ?

Or can just give functions the ability to scuttle the help that called them.

Should make the AI call a function, this function will cause the machine to halt if it is formatted correctly.  The message signal will be a forced end in the continuum, which can be seen by the branch ending.
