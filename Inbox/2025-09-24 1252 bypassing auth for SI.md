deploy an org, and have all auth be bypassed, by setting an env var secret.

when this secret is present, auth defaults to the name in the secret, so we could have dao.sato.com

so everyone comes in to a default computer, and each new session comes in with a new agent.

set a cookie to mark a browser so it can see other agents it created ?
