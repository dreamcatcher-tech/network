Make some kind of a competitive lab arrangement where companies can pay to be part of the lab - at the minimum they would supply their tech and pay for the build themselves.

Switcheability and open-ness is the key - eg: for a POS system, it must be able to integrate with many different front ends, and each front end must handle multiple different backends / chains.

So basically a bus that connects everything reduces the interconnect requirements.

No vendor lock in.
Rapid switchability.
Experimentation is required.
Interop is required.
Citizen Centric is the key.

Comparators for different solutions to compare them all on an open stage.

There is a business opportunity to sell lab spots on the island - it is valuable to a technology to have a place in the network on the island, and to operate in the metaverse.  Need a way to harness all the creativity and energy that the island will attract.

If we publish our requirements, and make these open, then inbound requests can fill out the form to compare themselves in this standard way.  We will supply resources to integrate you with the island, but this will cost, however it will be at market rates, and you can do it yourself, you just need to pay for one of our QAs to cert the work before it can increase in readiness level.

Make our own tech readiness level pipeline, and show implementation timelines, budgets, etc - show companies how they can make things go faster by providing money or expertise.

So we map out our requirements, and when they will be required 

? Can we show the need for an island wide bus ?

I want a home in the Venture Island, which should be the most technologically advanced place on earth, with a blockchain core.

Pioneer onboarding paths need to be clear.
