Make some kind of a competitive lab arrangement where companies can pay to be part of the lab - at the minimum they would supply their tech and pay for the build themselves.

Switcheability and open-ness is the key - eg: for a POS system, it must be able to integrate with many different front ends, and each front end must handle multiple different backends / chains.

So basically a bus that connects everything reduces the interconnect requirements.

No vendor lock in.
Rapid switchability.
Experimentation is required.
Interop is required.
Citizen Centric is the key.

Comparators for different solutions to compare them all on an open stage.

There is a business opportunity to sell lab spots on the island - it is valuable to a technology to have a place in the network on the island, and to operate in the metaverse.  Need a way to harness all the creativity and energy that the island will attract.

If we publish our requirements, and make these open, then inbound requests can fill out the form to compare themselves in this standard way.  We will supply resources to integrate you with the island, but this will cost, however it will be at market rates, and you can do it yourself, you just need to pay for one of our QAs to cert the work before it can increase in readiness level.

Make our own tech readiness level pipeline, and show implementation timelines, budgets, etc - show companies how they can make things go faster by providing money or expertise.

So we map out our requirements, and when they will be required 

? Can we show the need for an island wide bus ?

I want a home in the Venture Island, which should be the most technologically advanced place on earth, with a blockchain core.

Pioneer onboarding paths need to be clear.

Dream management - protect the lab, all else is permitted.   Need to manage and nurture the inrush of companies wanting to demo and build their products on the island so they can have a real world use case.  The lab needs protection by:
1. Protecting citizen privacy
2. Sharing rewards fairly with all lab participants
3. Always allowing concurrent solutions to interact with the same resource
4. Metaverse first deployment with load simulation

Describe the lab by a series of scenarios:
1. POS system that can take a payment off a cellphone for a coffee with near zero tx fee and offer finality instantly even with the internet disconnected

Make a list of core commitments made to the community.

We can make a lab that exports products to the world as a testing ground and a competitive arena to compare.  Be in charge of exports for the island - the lab and the exported software and services should be centrally controlled.  Exports are tested infrastructure software.

Try to be the system bus of the island - every system can integrate with the island thru this bus.  All user data is managed by this bus to ensure privacy.  Need DAO approval to even request access to private data.

Calendar-geolocation-intentions thing - part of the metaverse efforts that lets us find each other in space and time, so we coordinate travel and other meet ups.

Metaverse simulate water level rises, and nuke blasts - basically a full physics environment.  Simulate rainfall, expected catchment, erosion, drainage.

Mapping app: link the GPS trail chain to a citizenship NFT for verified ownership.  If we lean on ETH as security and ultimate ownership, then DRE can be experimental in nature but still used in a serious fashion.  So a website where you sign a tx that links your ETH wallet with DRE root chain, then we can use this for account recovery

If Ambient Attribution is provably decentralized, then anybody can use it as a revenue projection and not be a security.  If you rely on a single entity to get your contribution into a position where it can be utilized by others and receive AA, then that could be a security if you did not participate in its progress.
If DAO vote is enough to get members sued in court, then surely it is enough to be classed as participation, and therefore not a security ?

Make a list of anti-things - we do not want a bunch of lawyers and accountants - it should all be software only.

Inventory for the island - allow anyone to mint NFTs representing any physical goods they bring on to the island.  Makes it easy to pool resources where you can borrow things digitally or at least know they are present on the island.

Community discourse where they say what they want to contribute to the project.  They need to feel like they're building something, even if it is just debating issues and finding consensus.

Decent stablecoin backed by mortgage and timeshare arrangements that are available on chain via pooling.  Get a mortgage lender in to bankroll the development.  VC backing of the module construction company.  Stablecoin that you can trade openly, and it is backed by assets on the island while earning interest or capital gains is a great place to park money.

Get the modules manufactured locally in a factory, preferrably on the island itself.

Merge with other projects in the space - identify their similar needs.  They must surely be having developer issues, try get the DreamEther system working with them.

Postal service for the island, which is purely digital.

Org chart NFT mint station controlled by DAO.
Also mint any kind of award, which can be attached to packets.
Mint 'likes' where the DAO likes a proposal, but cannot afford to fund it.

Describe model for the DAO to vote and fund packets.

Add to the regulation based model implicit NDAs or some kind of base code of conduct for interactions.
## Importing modules
If each person had to KYC to pay for the module, then why not use their name to import the module anyway, avoiding SI doing anything ?

If the modules were set up in a test lab in the UAE, then they would be shipped in as second hand goods, and possibly exempt from much of the duties.
