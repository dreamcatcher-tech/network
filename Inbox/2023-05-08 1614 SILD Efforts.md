Make some kind of a competitive lab arrangement where companies can pay to be part of the lab - at the minimum they would supply their tech and pay for the build themselves.

Switcheability and open-ness is the key - eg: for a POS system, it must be able to integrate with many different front ends, and each front end must handle multiple different backends / chains.

So basically a bus that connects everything reduces the interconnect requirements.

No vendor lock in.
Rapid switchability.
Experimentation is required.
Interop is required.
Citizen Centric is the key.

Comparators for different solutions to compare them all on an open stage.

There is a business opportunity to sell lab spots on the island - it is valuable to a technology to have a place in the network on the island, and to operate in the metaverse.  Need a way to harness all the creativity and energy that the island will attract.

If we publish our requirements, and make these open, then inbound requests can fill out the form to compare themselves in this standard way.  We will supply resources to integrate you with the island, but this will cost, however it will be at market rates, and you can do it yourself, you just need to pay for one of our QAs to cert the work before it can increase in readiness level.

Make our own tech readiness level pipeline, and show implementation timelines, budgets, etc - show companies how they can make things go faster by providing money or expertise.

So we map out our requirements, and when they will be required 

? Can we show the need for an island wide bus ?

I want a home in the Venture Island, which should be the most technologically advanced place on earth, with a blockchain core.

Pioneer onboarding paths need to be clear.

Dream management - protect the lab, all else is permitted.   Need to manage and nurture the inrush of companies wanting to demo and build their products on the island so they can have a real world use case.  The lab needs protection by:
1. Protecting citizen privacy
2. Sharing rewards fairly with all lab participants
3. Always allowing concurrent solutions to interact with the same resource
4. Metaverse first deployment with load simulation

Describe the lab by a series of scenarios:
1. POS system that can take a payment off a cellphone for a coffee with near zero tx fee and offer finality instantly even with the internet disconnected

Make a list of core commitments made to the community.

We can make a lab that exports products to the world as a testing ground and a competitive arena to compare.  Be in charge of exports for the island - the lab and the exported software and services should be centrally controlled.  Exports are tested infrastructure software.

Try to be the system bus of the island - every system can integrate with the island thru this bus.  All user data is managed by this bus to ensure privacy.  Need DAO approval to even request access to private data.

Calendar-geolocation-intentions thing - part of the metaverse efforts that lets us find each other in space and time, so we coordinate travel and other meet ups.

Metaverse simulate water level rises, and nuke blasts - basically a full physics environment.  Simulate rainfall, expected catchment, erosion, drainage.

Mapping app: link the GPS trail chain to a citizenship NFT for verified ownership.  If we lean on ETH as security and ultimate ownership, then DRE can be experimental in nature but still used in a serious fashion.  So a website where you sign a tx that links your ETH wallet with DRE root chain, then we can use this for account recovery

If Ambient Attribution is provably decentralized, then anybody can use it as a revenue projection and not be a security.  If you rely on a single entity to get your contribution into a position where it can be utilized by others and receive AA, then that could be a security if you did not participate in its progress.
If DAO vote is enough to get members sued in court, then surely it is enough to be classed as participation, and therefore not a security ?

Make a list of anti-things - we do not want a bunch of lawyers and accountants - it should all be software only.

Inventory for the island - allow anyone to mint NFTs representing any physical goods they bring on to the island.  Makes it easy to pool resources where you can borrow things digitally or at least know they are present on the island.

Community discourse where they say what they want to contribute to the project.  They need to feel like they're building something, even if it is just debating issues and finding consensus.

Decent stablecoin backed by mortgage and timeshare arrangements that are available on chain via pooling.  Get a mortgage lender in to bankroll the development.  VC backing of the module construction company.  Stablecoin that you can trade openly, and it is backed by assets on the island while earning interest or capital gains is a great place to park money.

Get the modules manufactured locally in a factory, preferrably on the island itself.

Merge with other projects in the space - identify their similar needs.  They must surely be having developer issues, try get the DreamEther system working with them.

Postal service for the island, which is purely digital.

Org chart NFT mint station controlled by DAO.
Also mint any kind of award, which can be attached to packets.
Mint 'likes' where the DAO likes a proposal, but cannot afford to fund it.

Describe model for the DAO to vote and fund packets.

Add to the regulation based model implicit NDAs or some kind of base code of conduct for interactions.

Laser tag game played on the island and mirrored in metaverse.  Use cellphones as the guns, have metaverse players that can run around the island and can only be seen using the AR on the phones.  Physical players are the most powerful, but they are slow to move.  Play with full AR headsets like quest pro.  Set up some equipment like boxes to hide behind and play tag games.  Simulate beach landings and have turrets and armaments in AR with simple real world models like a chair with a swivel.  Generate the players using AI models and the gameplay using a Dojo.

Simulation of a city builder for any type of city.  Unreal engine that lets you model all kinds of citizen type of interactions.  Not specific to our island, but can be used to model your local street.  Can model things based on some photos or some videos.

Voting with an AI agent that always defends your interests.  Means you don't have to keep abreast of all developments and plans, but this agent will also ensure your voice is heard.  Set bounds, like encroachments on your views, some other metrics you care about, and your vote kicks in when some of these qualities are diminished.
## Importing modules
If each person had to KYC to pay for the module, then why not use their name to import the module anyway, avoiding SI doing anything ?

If the modules were set up in a test lab in the UAE, then they would be shipped in as second hand goods, and possibly exempt from much of the duties.


## Raising
Lots of people want the project to go ahead, so we need to get some extra capital.  We should list out the tasks we need done, and put some limited funds against it, and allow others to put into it.
For those people putting in cash and resources early, they should at least get recognition by way of NFTs.
Anyone should be able to suggest things that need doing.

Position it as, we got the land, the deal was we all need to come together and build it out.  So we should use the metaverse and the dreamcatcher as the way to communicate what needs doing, and coordinate between groups who want to do different types of things.  So we can put together some base proposals and work to get some initial things in motion.

## Metaverse as catalog
Make the metaverse a place to showcase homes, let users chat with the catalog, and see different things laid out visually, cost auto calculates.  Metaverse acts as a showroom.  We can markup our services to make other islands or resorts so people can quickly pick catalog items.  Mfg can pay to have their items put in the showroom.  Builders can experiment and do different layouts, then can have impact calculated on neighbours and others.  Sale of the software tooling can boost island revenue.

Investment, or purchase of assets that go onto the island and benefit it in some way, should be presented in the metaverse.  Being able to have beautiful still images in high rez of future plans, progress updates, etc - helps greatly with advertisement.

## Game home base
Use the assets and the NFT integration to allow other games to base on top of this one - have honourary worlds where they use the island as the world level.  Do shared deal where our players and their players combine somehow ?

## Project planning
In 4D, we should show how different configuration options will be chosen, and how parts will arrive on the island, so can show how the construction will occur.  Show the parts of the building being assembled after having been dropped on the island by boat.  LLM can do optimization of scheduling to find the best outcome.

Make a simulation of the DAO and the rules that were chosen, and show how it develops.

## Dreamcatcher simulation
Using ambient attribution, we can ensure people aren't fighting with each other to make sure they get a fair cut or that they don't overpay.  If we can show STC moving around the island, people can understand what the future holds for them.

The DAO should be in continual simulation mode in unreal, and people can play and share different outcomes.

Products and services should be sold in there, and the simulation impact be assessed each time.  Different vendors can offer different things, at different prices.  Different services can be bundled with it.  Missing services or things can be turned into Stucks, which is things we wish for, which would enable other things.

These imaginary pieces allow us to simulate with incomplete answers.  If only we had a house that weighed x, or if we had the price at y, then these things would occur.  If we had a mortgage service, then we could do y but the mortgage has a trigger of z so we need to find z.

Then, for missing things, we can gather commitment that can be used to trigger - like 10 people need to put in 10k each, then its on, so the DAO can be used to coordinate all that.

This simulator could be sold and other peoples problems be simulated in it, charging them building fees, which makes the whole thing better as we improve it generally.
## Website on Dreamcatcher
"who is involved" should show stateboard of the people in the project.  As discussion progresses, different people show up from wider and wider networks.  Basically citizenship plus registration means you're in the DAO, and if you share your profile, it can be spoken to by others, and you can get a summary of the contact.  Can only be contacted via AI proxy until they allow you direct comms.
"where is satoshi island" show a navigable map, show some unreal stills, and show how to download the game.
Questions about finances should be able to interrogate the DAO book-keeping.

Satoshi Island can be our first experimental social network.

Automatic internationlization.

We need a structure that can act like a public company that people can invest in because a future profit target is being worked towards.  Like the resale of DAO software, catalog marketplace cuts, other reasonable places to charge reasonable fees.  Then if people want to invest, they can purchase shares, which we can raise on and use to fund development.

## DAO being multilingual


## 3D threejs loading of models
If the metaverse was built using unreal, then we could extract model units, have the geometry and info tied to them as blockchains, and allow an inbrowser loader to manipulate and interrogate individual items.  https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_loader_gltf_avif can do some great looking stuff in browser.

## Listing contributions, impact, plans and needs
The island has to be built by the community - that was always the plan.
We need a registry showing who is contributing what, what it is costing them, the impact of it on them, and the impact on the community.
Showing what is pledged, what has been given, what stage it is at, helps spur on more contribution.
Showing what is needed and what the potential impact is also useful.
Allowing people to invest in things that have a certain impact on the island is useful too.

## Procedural scene generation in unreal
hook up NL commands to the scene generation tools, so can ask for more trees or less trees and it generates them.  Wave the want and have the procedural controls be applied by NL for you.  Could almost mine the app to train an NL in feedback from the app.

Can focus on simulations into the future, where we model say, the production of modular homes, and show the costs and impact of those.  Then we show homes from other sources coming in, and a range of blending between the two.  Lets us explore and have automated accounting figure out the impact for us.

## Construct homes on site
The best way to produce the homes is inside the shed they have. Barge the raw materials over, use local workers.  Use CAD to map out the construction requirements.  Allow highly digitized workflows so that builders can go thru all the details of the design from afar, rather than being to the island.  The highest investment is in time and travel to the island, so we should specialize in highly custom digital local builds, using local labour and paying into the local economy, using untaxed local materials.  This will be faster, cheaper, and benefit the locals more.

## Political forces
There is a conflict between STC, NFTs, and commercial efforts on the island.  Also we are trying to NFT everything - every asset, and also every task.  So we need a system to manage all those, and to ensure that the trades between them all are compliant.

The system is supposed to be a way to rapidly take a vote of intentions of people on the island.  So if someone wants to dip into the treasury, they need to get majority vote.  Tyranny of the majority and other lessons of democracy can be applied to any such votes.

We are supposed to be supporting community led development.
The issue is that there is not clean place for the community to have authoritative information, and no top level plan.  If we produce that, then all holders can verify their holdings and can have a voice.  That voice can be moderated by gpts, and stored on chain.

So talk to Thor and get some kind of DAO framework in place, so that votes can be cast and gathered, and help him to break down his plan into components.  Then we can allow for community members to preload the plan, and get some gains from that, if the treasury is genuinely increased.

Setting up a generalized company structure also aids in ambient attribution where the activities are all on chain.  Getting all assets on chain, then all plans, then all returns - this is the way to blockchain all the things.

We can make the votes and proposals be made into NFTs and posted to eth.
We can allow NFTs to be created and funded using crypto, whilst controlled and proposed using the AI layer, with git repos being the crypto secure way to link to these NFTs.

We need to show tech progress, so having a basic DAO would help immensely.  Then proposals could be put forwards and discussed, with votes taken.

This current conflict generates good data as to what our systems need to be able to handle.

Basic thing is making a proposal and having an agreement about it.
We should put that to the parties in control of the project at focus on the installing of governance as something that must be done, and with urgency.  It should not rest on the shoulders of a few - this is supposed to be a community project.
The proposal for the DAO voting structure should be a votable thing too.

? how do we know we are installing the correct governance system ?
Having an agent that acts as legal representative of the DAO seems best. 

Need copies of the LLC charter.

We need to get to a place where we can all work effectively together, and we can all live on the island in harmony without any emnities being built up during construction.  Every available resource should be harnessed for our goals.

Because there is no official published plan, anyone saying anything makes people worried that that's what the plan is.
We need to reconcile what the original promises of the project were to all those who participated financially.

Some of these issues could very well result in papers being published about how to handle conflict in certain situations.

We should vote on the goals and the metrics for those goals first, and then we can evaluate proposals based on if they reasonably contribute to the agreed goals.
So for STC it might be increase the price so we can increase the treasury size, to apply to the project, to increase the STC value further.
If prediction markets using STC were established, then people would escrow in the STC which pays to the actors if they make the thing happen, like a Dreamcatcher packet.
Prediction markets is a good use case for STC, and helps build the island.
It might be a valid way in which to do the treasury maneuvres.
So in voting phase, if enough people bet on it suceeding, it is enacted, but if they're wrong, their funds are lost.  If people bet against it, they get paid out to for being accurate.

Or what about dreamcatcher packets ? with a DAO layer to cover packets that conflict / use exclusionary resources.

## Vote structure
Long land holders should have more power than new ? or all the same ?
STC should be split based on its contribution to purchasing the island.
Need a constitution in midao.
Need transparent finances and legal documentation.
Need live project management, with publication of plans and measurement of results.
These are all problems in public companies, and if we learn how to handle these gracefully, then we have a resaleable product.
We could start as just a community run DAO with token holders in voluntarily before acending to the true DAO.  Then the token holders would have a voice, and will inevitably become the DAO authority.

STC is on a separate chain, and so should be set up like a separate congress.  For now people can signal their votes, and how these get interpreted is separate.  We can do these tests directly on Dreamcatcher for ease of use.

Maybe have a different vote system for different aspects ?
Futarchy for STC where the efforts that cause the future price increase are attributed back some how ?

Jury based systems where members are chosen at random for a particular purpose.
## Attribution for promotional efforts
The token rises and falls for many reasons.  If people undertake direct efforts to cause gains, then we should have a way to apportion the gains to them.  Then of the gains attributed to them, they are able to take a certain percentage out as reward.
A floored token that spikes and goes back down is better than one that just stays down.

NFT based tasks that represent a goal to be done, where the payout is formulaic - this is how the whole DAO should be run.

Convert that into impact crystals so the efforts of multiple parties can be measured.

Need to know how promoters would measure their efforts, and record their efforts and reach.

Funds and bills paid need to be recorded, and bills paid by members need to be tracked, where these get repaid as soon as possible.

## AI education centre for children
For nomads with kids, can come and teach an AI based carriculum.
Perhaps adults can learn something in this way too.
Local kids can benefit from the education too.

## Soulbinding
Utilize registered agents in the area, like Paul, to be able to soulbind citizenship NFTs.  This can be incorporated into the voting structure of the island.

## Ownership map
Clarify where the legal ownership sits, and what guarantees are upholdable in the NFTs.
Each ownership claim needs to be backed up with documents, and then we should get it all notarized by a legal professional
## Proposal pipeline with thresholds
thresholds are for making sure the proposal does things that meet all the core values and the rquirements for this particular realm. [[2024-06-12 1033 impact of pump and dump]]


## DAO voting structure components and suggests
People can use these as starting points for their ideas
Submit scenarios to the system so we can thoroughly explore what potentials exist.
We should frame the problem as larger, since all DAO's have this problem, and even countries have this problem, and so a general templated solution will be more acceptable vs a singular one, since we can lean on others as justification for choices.

The reasoner for its design should be able to justify why it made certain design choices, and so we deflect that actual design off somewhere else, rather than it being the project's problem.
## Real estate gains
Underneath, the island or land should be tradeable based on the approved value of the land.  With this as part of the proposition and future value, we should proceed.

## Second island as a compact lab
Something like the UAE as a compact lab for blockchain tech, community governance, AI, modular rapid housing of varioius calibres.  Lets us plan and stage for hitting the main island.
The lab could also serve as a financial hub, where the finance base of the lab is established.
This provides gateways to the traditional banking services.

Export tech and services to build out lots of other remote locations, export financial tech for processing crypto, and provide a banking services hub to integrate with other institutions using kyc to ensure AML.  Expertise and consulting.  Provide instant venture DAO.

This hub could be used to incubate satoshi island.

## Stake to Say
Whatever you say, have a set of virtues that you commit to, and then stake funds if what you say doesn't actually follow those things.

## Medivac packages
If we know the local doctor, and have him on speed dial, plus know the insurance providers, then we can provide an NFT purchasable package to guarantee medical cover.  Also provide stats like time to available medical attention.  Then if we could get a doctor on the island, that is another win.  Provide an app that has location access.  For a fee, provide video consults with this remote doctor, since the quality is about the same.

## Emergency DAO
a timeline of events, and proof of these events happening.  Scrutiny can be invited and the record set straight.
Put a banner up top that warns about this being draft software.
A vault of all the documents related to the project.
Wait for fsc blockers to clear, then pursue.
Set up project funding for legal action, and work out fair payback conditions for those that help with recovery, like expense covering + bonus.
DAO being forkable - as differences emerge, then we can allow forks to occur, so people can exit.
Relay messages between groups, like whatsapp groups and other groups can get summaries relayed around when major events occur.
Each time someone says something, their token weight is considered too, for some decisions this matters, but ultimately the bots logic is what matters.

## DAO problems
Comms channels, like whatsapp groups are:
- often not linked to the DAO reasoning process
- fragmented by user preferences and social friendzones - no official disemination
