two parties can agree to do coco between each other, so that they both have confidentially run a computation

basically if we are the confidential computer company, selling confidential computers (or co2 for short) then there is no reason why a coco can't be fragmented and offer different areas of confidentiality on a per app basis - like a confidential computer isn't necessarily one domain of confidentiality, it can be several

but perhaps deepest of all, if we consider the oil and gas recon use case, we can enable two coco computers to cooperatively run a third mutual coco computer, so that they both run parts of the confidential bits together

we can also allow for guaranteed execution but only the results come back, like for example, we might make a docker container that was designed to audit a gas trading database.  Shell can give it to BP, BP runs it on its coco, BP returns the result, which might be just a pass or fail, and the coco execution report back to Shell, and shell can trust that the remote server is in compliance, but they didn't need to see the exact data
