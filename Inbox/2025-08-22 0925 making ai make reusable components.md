If we gave a bunch of use cases and asked it to make some components that could be rearranged to solve the problem, this might be a good way to get it to adaptively modify things and reuse.

the components make it easier to be right every time.

then it becomes about getting a schema modeled language right to configure the components, rather than to make the components themselves.
