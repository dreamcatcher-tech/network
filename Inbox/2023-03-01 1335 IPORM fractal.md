IPORM should be able to be used within itself, by virtue of hashings being able to jump out of any context.

This is what Interpulse is aiming to do, where we would want the user to use IPORM inside their state, or their application, to model chains as objects and use our layers to manage the translation and distribution of these layers.

Interpulse is a layer that lets more complex IPORM entries be used with the additional property of history or time, and arbitrary execution of functions.
