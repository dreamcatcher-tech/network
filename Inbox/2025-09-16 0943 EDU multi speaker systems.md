by reserving a tone and vocal persona (or even a speaker location) we can build up reputation with the child for different things.

a narrator voice can give background commentary, speaking in deep authorative tones.

if the child misbehaves badly, the top level narrator kicks in.

narrator is good as background context when telling a story, as it makes it more multi character.

we should detect multi talking, and train the children to speak one at a time to get what they want.

having several agents coorperating, as well as a top level reasoning model guiding and steering behind the others, makes for a better long term running goal.

the steering agents are trying to meet parental goals, as well as their best guess at educational benchmarking and expansion on weaker areas.

they can also tweak the control of the model, like VAD settings, and other tools.
we give them multiple sensor data, like all the mic feeds, and so they try and find optimal settings for some goal output, which is something like strong correlation between the realtime detected speech and the long running analysis, and whatever other metrics we figure out that it needs.

this saves us from developing the settings tuning to get it right for a given environment.
there is the current real time tweaker, and then there is the long term multi day tweaker.
