In OpenSea, collection names have to be unique.  In DRE this would be represented by a chain at a path, which was allowed to change its name into anything not already taken.

Ownership of this path should tradeable on the marketplace, so if someone has a name you like, you can buy it.  Any part of the app that introduces scarcity should be able to be traded.
