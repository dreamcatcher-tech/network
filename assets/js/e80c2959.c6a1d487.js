This is the only way that supply chains can be corrected and made to function fairly end to end. The purest form of correction is the voting on algorithms and parameters that calculate what attribution should be, rather than direct assertions. Fairness seems to demand that all projects should be subjected to the same algorithm, too, and so it might be that the ultimate attribution algorithm is a large sampling based solution, rather than an actual formula."),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"Dreamcatcher projects in native mode disperse a percentage of each revenue transaction to the stack of dependencies that created the project.

The algorithm can never be particular to any given project, and acts as a sort of global appraisal system, as no interested party can ever be given the power to set some parameter that could advantage them."))}d.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
