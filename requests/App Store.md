## CRM example
This is made of

sysbus, apilib, crm, router, pdf templates.

Each module can have a connection to a marketplace, so the pdf templates module also allows you to ask for a template to be made and solicit job offers for small tasks.

API lib lets you ask for different connections to different pieces of software.
