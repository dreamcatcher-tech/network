To ensure we have the correct architecture, and to help understanding of our architecture, we need a set of use cases that are both meaningful and highlight the capabilities we offer.

Where possible a comparison to a conventional method should be given, as well as some performance characteristics.

A set of core features should be listed, and each use case should indicate which core features it leverages.  This should be able to be stacked into a table, and placed in a delivery order with the least number of features coming first.
