We need some basic tutorials to excercise the system, show its strengths, and highlight areas we need to improve.

These should have readmes, instructions on how to set up and test, and some discussion of the advantages over the conventional way of doing things.

Should show how to publish the work, and how to fund further development or ask for extra help by submitting ideas to the swarm.

All tutorials should start with some form of create-react-app like scaffolding, with possibly each tutorial having its own template, and the ability to make your own template.

Finally, each Request for tutorial should be able to be funded, and invite contributors to improve in exchange for attribution, The attribution flow from new users discovering the framework and earning using the framework should be clear, to show how ambient attribution works for those who produce educational materials.

This would give an easy onramp to those with commercial ideas to find their team to make it happen.
