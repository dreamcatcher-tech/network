Incentives in the Network must be a highly transmissible and stable form of currency.  Our initial usage has been Fiat using the [wise.com](https://wise.com) platform to act like digital money.  A more native currency is required in the long term to reduce the friction between members.

Friction takes the form of KYC and AML documentation requirements, which require trust in a 3rd party.  We believe a currency can be constructed that exceeds current KYC and AML requirements without any of the paperwork required.

Further, the use of Fiat always requires trust in an intermediary (in this case wise.com) whereas a native currency can reduce this trust further.

A native currency must be programmable, in that further functions can operate atop the currency using an API.
