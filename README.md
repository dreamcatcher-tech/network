## Proofs
Using https://opensig.net/about.html this file (README.md) is hashed and submitted to the ethereum contract at [0x73eF7A3643aCbC3D616Bd5f7Ee5153Aa5f14DB30](https://etherscan.io/address/0x73eF7A3643aCbC3D616Bd5f7Ee5153Aa5f14DB30) so that (deep breath...) the commit hash of the commit one prior to the README.md file commit is stored in the blockchain and a link to the transaction is stored in the commit after that commit.

Basically the README.md file hash is stored on chain, and in that file is the git commit hash of a prior commit.  This can be used to proof existence at least before the blocktime that the transaction gets included in.
