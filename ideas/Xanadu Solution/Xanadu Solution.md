[[Xanadu Principles]]
Some fundamental problems with the way the web was built that Xanadu objects to and which we hope to solve:

## Servers cannot be transmitted easily

We appear to have solved transmitting the output of servers to the input of other servers, but the servers themselves remain off-net.
Servers is mentioned heavily in the Xanadu model, and we would propose they are merely another form of content.  
They are special in that they are content that can generate more content - a Process - but this property is shared by other objects in the system, such as People, and Programs, and Sensors.
Content itself is merely the past states of Processes

## Folders cannot contain information

At some point, folders were made different from files, but they should be the same thing

## Files cannot be in more than one place

Files were not made as by default in multiple locations simultaneously, with strong guarantees about consistency.
