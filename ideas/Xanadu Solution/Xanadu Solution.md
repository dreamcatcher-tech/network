[[Xanadu Principles]]
Some fundamental problems with the way the web was built that Xanadu objects to and which we hope to solve:

## Servers cannot be transmitted easily

We appear to have solved transmitting the output of servers to the input of other servers, but the servers themselves remain off-net.
Servers is mentioned heavily in the Xanadu model, and we would propose they are merely another form of content.  
They are special in that they are content that can generate more content - a Process - but this property is shared by other objects in the system, such as People, and Programs, and Sensors.
Content itself is merely the past states of Processes

We need to redefine server as:
> 

## Folders cannot contain information

At some point, folders were made different from files, but they should be the same thing

## Files cannot be in more than one place

Files were not made as by default in multiple locations simultaneously, with strong guarantees about consistency.

Servers and Users are the same object in the system, the difference being who controls the keys.  The users are controlled by a person or group of people, but the server may be uncontrolled or controlled.

## Making a [[Comparator]] for Xanadu
Then do a list of assessments for tooling and groups of tooling, and show how they score.  Eg: google docs, github, wikipedia, wordpress

## Making Dreamcatcher-AI as a candidate
Send Ted an email listing all the principles of Xanadu and how we solve each one.
Invite him to make a Stuck within the Dreamcatcher, to define what Xanadu is, and why the Dreamcatcher currently is not it, so we can put funding against it.

If we can get him to at least make a Stuck defining Xanadu, and how we are different, then get this published on the ethereum chain.

Get him to make Xanadu bot, which can arbitrarily answer questions about the system.

We would make him a dead mans switch on the Xanadu.  A Stuck that he was in charge of QA on, but if his keys did not sign in for a year, then the ability of his annointed followers would be engaged so they could pass the QA on the item.  QA would be the AI pass, plus the human pass.

Show transclusions for modified text, where the closeness can be used to show partial transclusion.
Show taking traditional text, and generating transclusion data from it, so that the royalties can be paid in arrears and offsystem.
Healing the web by backfilling transclusions when they are not there.

We can use their EDL format to store references inside the state of chains.

## Transclusion as attribution trees
If the transclusion format was used as a way to attribute back to owners, then we can start paying for code, but also for any kind of information.  It can be applied to physical items too.

## Notes
Teds persistent insistence on correctness and provenance.
