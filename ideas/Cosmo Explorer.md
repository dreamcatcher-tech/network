# Cosmo Explorer

> Targets: [[Pulse Explorer]] <br/>
> Depends: [[Cosmo Viewer]]

The [Cosmo Viewer](https://cosmograph.app/run/?data=https://cosmograph.app/data/184R7cFG-4lv.csv) offers GPU accelerated graph display for graphs with millions of nodes.

We should be able to make a package that can serve as a good default viewer for Pulses, but also be easily extensible to view custom data stored in Pulses.

The viewer should allow provenance tracing, and attribution forecasting and auditing.  WhatIf scenarios should be allowed.
