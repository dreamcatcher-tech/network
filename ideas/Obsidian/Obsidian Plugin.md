>[!question] Targets: [[Obsidian as first Dreamcatcher]]

>[!danger] Depends: 

Using Obsidian as the base, we could make a plugin for their system which can let people interact directly with the dreamcatcher.

Markdown documents could be used with additional syntax to access functionality native to Dreamcatcher, such as markets, funding balances, and other live informaiton.

Problems are that Obsidian is made for .md files, and so a filesystem that is entirely virtual, with no files on disk, might not be possible.
