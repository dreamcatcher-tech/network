Basically want a system that can be spoken to, or that can eavesdrop, and will convert what it hears into packets and droplets of atomic ideas and compound ideas, compatible with [[2023-10-13 1441 voip transcriptions on chain]]

## The assistant AI
I should be able to ask a question with simply, here's the prompt I want, and here's sort of the answer I want, and maybe here's the intermediary steps that I need to see it go through, and then I should be able to get a response from the LLM that indicates what type of prompt I would need to ensure those steps, and possibly if I would need some sort of a loop mechanism in there as well.

So I think what I want is to have the ability to drop down snippets of statements or ideas, pointing out things, and then I want the LLM to take that knowledge, break it apart down to atoms, insert it into the Zettelkaskin where appropriate, perhaps update some packets, jot it down as a most recently used item, and also flag up packets that are moved forwards in completion because of the droplet that I had just inserted into the machine.

Additionally, I would like to know when the droplets from other people in my peer group who I share connections with or that I am just listening to have entered droplets that affect or move forward the packet that I am interested in providing perhaps some way for me to move forward by me recognizing that droplet and building on the innovation that they released.
## Data ingestion from previous formats

We must be able to ingest prior data, and other peoples formats into our own.  Plus we should all be working towards a shared version.  This version is enabled by blockchains, which can be copied on multiple computers.
### walk this obsidian notebook show plans of changes
At each idea in the Inbox, parse it into the standard format, highlight what information is lost in the transformation, and show the changes to the app that it wants to make - list of patches it wants to apply to other items, or new items it wants to create.
