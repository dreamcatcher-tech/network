LLMs can be used to figure out who best to ask when they have a question that cannot answer themselves - *Suggested by SM 2023-10-12*

Use LLM to be able to identify who best to ask for a packet that was proposed. If they don't know something, they should be able to figure out who is the best person to ask. This would be a corollary of forming an LLM upkept social network, where creating a connection to someone is not an active thing and it does not need reciprocation. It occurs because the LLM thinks it's there already, or it thinks it should be there, and it reaches out politely to the recipient LLM to see if a reciprocal connection should be made and advertised, and information should be shared along that link.

So using LLMs to determine who best to ask a question, and having agent LLMs proxying requests going out to people who have a reputation for being able to work, can remove one of the biggest inefficiencies in the software marketplace, which is team building, team forming. It acts as the need for recruiters, and given that switchability is now automated, it means that going freelance doesn't require the heavy investment in networking that it used to, and so it can be a stable job with the LLM providing predictions and cues, and the LLMs making commitments even to each other for stability, so that the network as a whole can be considered a stable job.

Then based on the advertised status of all LLMs, sharing what people are working on and what thye have done, routing thru the network can be estimated for cost and delivery times, with some kind of boundaries.
