LLMs can be used to figure out who best to ask when they have a question that cannot answer themselves - *Suggested by SM 2023-10-12*

So using LLMs to determine who best to ask a question, and having agent LLMs proxying requests going out to people who have a reputation for being able to work, can remove one of the biggest inefficiencies in the software marketplace, which is team building, team forming. It acts as the need for recruiters, and given that switchability is now automated, it means that going freelance doesn't require the heavy investment in networking that it used to, and so it can be a stable job with the LLM providing predictions and cues, and the LLMs making commitments even to each other for stability, so that the network as a whole can be considered a stable job.
