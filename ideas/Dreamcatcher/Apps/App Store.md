The app store is an app in the app store.

Everything we do should be easily presented in the app store.  Default filters would be the consumer facing view that shows only applications with some level of quality guarantee.

Can be end user only, or can filter for packages, or for services.

Each app that shows up shows its dependencies, and shows if it uses an external service.  Interogate each leg of the diagram and see the shape of the data being transmitted.

Shows other places it is integrated with apps, to show what it is commonly used for.
