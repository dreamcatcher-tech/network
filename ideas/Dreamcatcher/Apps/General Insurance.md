## Vs Market
It should always be cheaper, since we can start with the same pricing as the market, and include [[Comparator]]s that keep watch on the performance of competitors, then we would know all our costs and much of that would be automated.

Because of the higher transparency and active involvement of our reputation scored members, we should always have less claims than the conventional pools.  We should also have less costs since much of our operation is automated, and there are no legal fees or dispute arbiter fees as this is managed by the members.

Unbundle the legal claims seeking service that goes out to collect damages from other parties that have wronged our parties.  These services get paid by wins and may choose to charge a regular fee in order to smooth out the cost of each incident.

Also our pools can adapt quicker to changing conditions, and people can leave and form their own pools if they see bad signs occuring.

Over time we would always adapt down to below market since it would be the lowest possible sustainable cost for our members.
