API for providing insurance to anyone
Also permit pooling so calculations can be avoided, particularly if they're too hard or unknown.

Some events, some verification method, some payout to average the losses.
Then you should be able to attach insurance to any event at all.
Could do exchange forward contracts.
Need an arbiter.

Could make a model of an API that can be used for any kind of insurance, and can operate with varying degrees of trust in each component.
