The purpose of the Dreamcatcher blockchain in an AI application context is:

> **The baked program is the thing that gets published for further improvement by others**

It is a way of compression of the AI's work, so it only needs to be a little bit better next time.

It is first tested by using full AI to stand over the process until it is accepted as ok by the human.
Then the human plus the AI work to back it into code.
This iteration in code is then run thru the test suites and then released by an AI deciding when it is ok to publish.

Having an app store searchable by an AI, silently and guarnateed to be working on your behalf totally kill the advertising game - it really is about pure utility, since the AI won't be fooled.  Advertising relies on your inability to process data quickly, or to ignore some data.  Sponsored should mean the AI sees some benefit, in that it will receive rewards for using that vs another one, like free trial credits.

So the blockchain is the in which complex AI operations can be encoded in reliable ways to continue to keep the AI layer thin, otherwise there is a limit to how high the AI stack can sway in the breeze.

The app store is fuzzy.

The app store is a dojo / factory, as well as a marketplace.  "I found an app" becomes "I found a strategy".  The similarity is handled by an AI overlord that says what goes in what buckets.  When you are playing with a strategy it will find ones that are similar to what you are doing, or suggest parts that can be done with existing strategies, and it can test them and rank them based on usage metrics.

? But how does the attributor fit into this model ?

If AI is a context gobbler, then blockchain becomes a high precision context preserver.  It represents the ideal form of context, and so the AI in and AI app acts as a context transformer, where it compresses it down into a blockchain context.
