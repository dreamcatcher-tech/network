Github Copilot is being sued because some claim it takes from their source code and cuts them off from their users.

Instead, each time a user consumes an AI suggestion, the place it was learned from is attributed and receives some fees automatically based on the price charged to use the AI, since the power required is larger than a single user, so they have to pay something at least.

Also the user can see where the source of their suggestions have come from, and can investigate it themselves.

Giving attribution to the datasets used in AI training could be big business for us.
