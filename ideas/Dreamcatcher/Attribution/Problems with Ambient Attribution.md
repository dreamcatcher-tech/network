### Payments publicize company revenue
For the [[CRM Deployment]], receiving payment for each collection can reveal the total take from the company.  This might not be a problem for a company that is striving for transparency, but can be a problem for existing companies.

We could randomize the payment so that it averaged out to the same, but hid each month.
We could act like it was multiple companies so the data cannot be collated.
