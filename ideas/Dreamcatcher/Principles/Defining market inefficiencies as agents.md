We can use SuperAGI to write an agent (or set of agents) that can adversarially go thru the current state of any texts that list out our principles, and perform some research and balancing about them.

Make a git repo so that the edits can be tracked, and then trigger SuperAGI to kick off a job that will modify the descriptions, and then ripply thru everything running tests and rewriting where needed, then update the whole website when some of our key principles change.

It would then build an agent that used this material as cannon, and then tested the chat bot on some quiz questions that it generated from the source material, with multiple iterations or fuzziness and randomness, plus some injected errors, then compares the results with the source material to see if it agrees.

Search a body of economics text to use as canon, particularly guttenburg texts, and some reference texts that we select.

We could make our own agent that can tell people what to write or guide them thru packet creations.
