AKA - Pay Packet.

The funder puts up a month of salary, where an additional QA is a clock.  The packet has an additional QA that is a personal address or group of addresses.
The job description must pass QA.  The identity of the pair must pass QA so we can't be used for money laundering ?
The effects of the work should make changes to packets that can be recognized by the QAs.
At the end blocktime, the funder has 3 days to object if they think the work was not performed successfully.  
Any time after the blocktime, the solver can submit a proposed solution that details what work was done.  This is checked by QA to match the packet request, and verified in the case of off chain work.

This packet may be recurring and can have regular payouts scheduled, which can be updated over time to reflect changing pay expectations.

The packet is open to be funded by anyone, but the payout is specified by a [[QA Types | Solver Specific QA]] 


Cannot allow blank work descriptions since this could be used for money laundering if it was using credit card payments ?

Your relationship with the gateway company is prepayment for work to be done, where the work is specified in the packet description.  The gateway company is responsible for this work.  The subcontractors responsibility is to provide the specified work to the gateway company.  That the gateway pays in DAI is irrelevant to the purchaser.

## Attribution
The work done by the solver is detailed in the solution they submit.  Any work they did that is covered by this packet then has an attribution split between them and the funders.

## Wrap these with employment contracts
This mode of payment can be backed by employment contracts issued by some corporate entity that provides this liability shield in exchange for some fee.
