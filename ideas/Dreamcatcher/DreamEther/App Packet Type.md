Could we make this be defined by being the target of a top level app packet ?

So we start with some fundamental packet types that are predeployed, then require all packets to have a parent of some kind.

Problems would we a packet that sought to reveal all possible problems in the world.
Specs would be a packet to reveal all possible ideas in the world.
Apps would be to make all possible end user products and list them in the app store.
