## Propose edits without funding
The could be comments or edits that are helpful, but you do not want to propose a change to the actual NFT, but rather want to notify anyone who might be working on this packet that they might want to include this info in the next update.

## View NFTs and token graphics for funds
If someone funds using a random NFT, we should use the supplied token methods to present that token graphically, and link to the opensea website so they can be appraised.

## Leaderboards
Show activity for funding and solving and see who is earning the most.

## Dev estimations
Funding is the summation of many commitments, but estimations should be the merge of many estimations.  These should be linked to an account.  In the contract we may update the packet metadata each time a new estimation comes in, so bidders on opensea can see.  Could be restricted to only those whom QA have passed any actions for.

## Treemap of tasks
Treemaps give a good size estimation view of things.  Can show the graphics of the task in the graph.

## Versions of packets and events
Let drafts select versions since we can walk our own internal chain to find these changes.
When packets and headers get changed, can see the history of them, altho possibly in a different way, like a timeline.
