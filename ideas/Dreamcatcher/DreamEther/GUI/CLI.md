Provide a CLI interface to the whole application as a single terminal or a window that just takes a prompt.

If chat was the only interface, then at the side or in window was graphical selectors you could use to communicate choices better, like multichoice selection, this might be a better interface to present ?

This could run in nodejs on the terminal, since metamask can be used to sign transactions.
The first version of the app could be done using just a terminal running in the browser.
Images and descriptions can be done using pop up modals or a cli based editor, so if you are running on your local terminal, then we would open up your configured editor ?

Might be a fast way of getting things working, plus get the covenants design worked out ?

Should be able to control the whole contract with just a CLI version of the app.  Can display images using a terminal image generator.
