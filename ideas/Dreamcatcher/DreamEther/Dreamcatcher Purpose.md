Focus primarily on the building of a packet based innovation protocol, which generates a large data set of interactions, which is used to construct an attribution artifial intelligence named "Dreamcatcher AI" that can eloquently and instantly answer the question of how much of this revenue should go to this person based on their contribution ?

"the radiant AI at its heart ensures fair attribution of rewards."

Need to be able to chat with the Dreamcatcher and have it answer questions and provide suggestions.

Replace the QA with a machine.
Assign attribution by machine, in realtime, at the micropayment level.
Highlight attribution errors outside of the packet based invention machine.

There are two kinds of attribution decision that need to be made:
1. Of all there different contributions, how to apportion to each the completed task ?
2. Between the three groups: funders, solvers, and dependencies, how should attribution be split ?

Ultimately we look like a system where people can put money in to and receive 
If there's a way for a company to make as much money as it wants by pumping money in to something thats open source, that's something that people have been looking for for a long time.

## Prompts

write a blog post for highly intelligent readers that describes the purpose of the dreamcatcher being based on https://dreamcatcher.land but extending it by being focused primarily on the building of a packet based innovation protocol, which generates a large data set of interactions, which is used to construct an attribution artifial intelligence named "Dreamcatcher AI" that can eloquently and instantly answer the question of how much of this revenue should go to this person based on their contribution ?
