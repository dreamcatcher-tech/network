We need to make packets usable across multiple languages easily.  A system that lists all the names we use and all the contexts they get used in is usable for internationalization as well as for experimenting with the names we want.

Need the same thing for all the visual overlays that represent each one - so each packet class and state needs a name, some contextual sentences, and some image overlays that get used on them.

Let people view packets with a GPT translator, where the original language is stored, but gpt can parse translations.  The structure of the system should make translation easier, since the roles can be readily understood.

People can probably use this to present the dreamcatcher in any other way they want, for game tokens, or services, or anything at all.
