Could allow people to create NFTs for effort that has already been expended.

Can still get the QA passes to occur, and the funding can be done in some kind of asserted dollars.

So a company is set up, that offers to provide proof of spend and issue some ERC20 based on this.  So any currency on earth can be listed as an erc1155 contract.

Eg: for the linux kernel, an NFT would be created that describes the linux kernel, and instead of an account for the solver, some kind of proof is inserted, such as linus using his pgp key to unlock the funds.  Then people can start pointing to this contribution target for all their micropayments of usage.
