If we take the profits we make from solving packets and reinvest them into packets that build the dreamcatcher, then the early clients should receive some attribution too.

So in effect, people can be investing in our future value by putting work thru us.  This should sweeten the deal with people even further, since we are a transparent dev company looking to achieve a higher goal then pay out to everyone who helped us along the way.

The devs are able to get equity, and the customers get royalty on the extra payments they receive.

Rent out an office, pay devs in local currency, export their services ?  Core team would do the daily management, but the packets would be for remote work operations.  Core team would be to show to customers there is a base team, and to get residence in UA, and get funds moving in to the UA system.  Also may need to pay some devs in UA$, and can get them to work on dreamcatcher stuff in their idle time.  

Use the funds to purchase gold, digitize it, then pay devs in it ?  Vault it in singapore, then trade it locally.

Launch on the stockmarket in UA ?

We can manage other teams of devs locally for remote clients ?

Set up solar, batteries, and starlinks, and be on the outskirts of the city ?  Hire food and services to make living good.  Offer sanctuary to those who would work.  Hire other skills and build modular housing.

Build precast concrete structures that can be used to rapidly erect bunkers, so workers are unaffected by air raids.
