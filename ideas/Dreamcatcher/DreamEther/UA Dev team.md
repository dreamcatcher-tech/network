If we take the profits we make from solving packets and reinvest them into packets that build the dreamcatcher, then the early clients should receive some attribution too.

So in effect, people can be investing in our future value by putting work thru us.  This should sweeten the deal with people even further, since we are a transparent dev company looking to achieve a higher goal then pay out to everyone who helped us along the way.

The devs are able to get equity, and the customers get royalty on the extra payments they receive.
