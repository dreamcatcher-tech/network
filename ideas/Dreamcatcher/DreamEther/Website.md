We need a webpage to manage the Dreamcatcher entries.  This should follow the UniSwap format, and launch the app when requested, but have all the info on the main page.

Compose button, then ask what they want to do next.

List all the packets and different types ?

Present packets as a bundle of components.  Make a graphical artefact that shows all the pieces together.

Could use snapshot as the way to process Dreamcatcher packets ?

Image generation tool that does a series of overlays on each image, and shows how the packet artwork will look under all different circumstances.
