This is a list of scenarios to ensure that [[DreamEther Packets]] can provide what we want to see

## NFT contribution for auditing SILD smart contracts
I want to be able to receive a commemorative NFT for the service of auditing the smart contracts.
The NFT must be verified to have come from Satoshi Island.  It need not be for money.

SI would create a Spec Packet, requesting the audit of the contracts.  This would then get listed on OpenSea so that people could fund it.  They should also be able to escrow in 

## NFT for bringing Starlink equipment onto the island
I want an NFT that is offered as a prize for successfully getting the first starlink connection on the island.

SI would create a Spec Packet, with an additional QA listed as the SI address, so that before the packet can solve, 

## Using metaverse for a graphical state change
The NFT should include the graphics in it

## SI granting license to run Resorts on the Island
Want to be able to see what licenses have been granted and to who.

## Venture Village restricting payouts to identities
Their funders want to fund packets with the condition that the funds only go to a preselected group of closers.

In this case they would specify their own additional QA, who would ensure that the contributors were predominately from Nigeria.  These conditions would be made clear in the packet.
