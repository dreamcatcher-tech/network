As a general rule, we should have the core objectives of the Dreamcatcher be able to include any type of AI both now and in the future.  The data layer of the system should remain ever the same, as well as the payment principles.  The question is which AI and how much of it, never if an AI should be used or not.  Ultimately we want to run our own blockchain, which runs our own AI on top of it.

If we made a plugin for chatGPT, then we could let people write packets consersationally.
Images could be generated alongside the prompt.

As they are writing their packets, we can be suggesting edits that would write for them, and can be generating images that summarize what they are writing.  Summaries are always auto generated, to ensure a consistent standard of summarization.

Search can be done using natural language across all packets.

Ask questions to find types of packets, find people who can write types of packets for you, and estimate chances of success, estimate length of time for things, and back up those answers.

Try turn a conversation into a packet.

Packet name generation that does not collide with anything else.

Auto insert references to the dictionary for new terms.  Detect and highlight new terms and provide definitions down the side, or ask for some to be submitted if not present.

Write a packet that is missing that it thinks is a useful high value thing.

Packet value estimation.

Extracting pure problem statements, or at least scoring the purity.

The chat prompt has drop down filters that it uses to target what you are saying.  As you navigate round the site, the prompt target changes to let you interact with the information you are reading.  Turn on different modes, like prior art search, or other forms of discussion.  The chat prompt lets you navigate to different parts of the site.  It stays at the top of the page, and what is below continually changes, allowing you to click on the info to navigate / focus in on it, and have a conversation with each section.  The navigation lets you scope your queries.

Your chats should be long lived, and you should get notified when an answer pops up at some later point in time.

Change the length params of the answers you want - can alter the size of the box below the search using hotkeys or mouse to indicate how much output you want.

> Imagine a world where you give some free text description of your recycling bin lorry business and the problem, it generates the Request, which generates proposed ideas, matches with existing packets and writes the code for the missing parts using AlphaCode or similar, then passes it off to a human QA to make sure the original Intent was met...

I don't see anyone else thinking about innovation as a timeseries progression of network interactions that produce discrete reusable packets, while recording the interactions for use as a learning set.

We should set this vision up as a packet and chuck some funding against it.

Suggested links to other packets based on what your notion was.
The receiving packet can be paid to run its AI to determine whether it should accept the incoming request or not.  If the packet has a dedicated AI assigned to it, it is as tho the idea can think for itself and can, somewhat on its own, navigate all the information being thrown at it to work closer to a solution without human intervention, where different participants pay to run that AI to achieve their own goals, with the side effect of advancing the packets goals.

Submit your responses to peoples requests, and be able to see how their AI summarizes what you said.



## Worker assistance
Workers should be able to search for packets rapidly, and should also be alerted when something they might be good at comes in.  They can indicate when they are working on something as an optimization signal to others.  They can start committing any way they like.  The packet shows activity update rates.

## Price guestimation
Using AI tooling to make educated guesses on pricing and timing, and indicate when a packet needs more funding to complete it.

## Document Tooling
Expressing ideas cleanly, rapidly, for people with ADHD and busy lives is crucial to success.  Providing too

Each paragraph of text is treated like a block of code.  Tools popup around it, letting it be rearranged, upvoted (which is a social activity), exploded out into consituents, manually rewritten, rewored / smoothed, merged with other blocks and concepts.

This web of connectivity between blocks, where each block has a history as well, is the source used to construct an ai generated document that strikes the right tone.

These webs can be bundled up and used as blocks within other webs, so you can reproduce content for different audiences, auto merge multiple wrapping blocks together, auto summarize.

Once the drop is complete, can auto regen the document to settle everything in so the doc flows completely.


## Embeddings
We want to be able to constantly update the embeddings to include the most recent ideas entered into the Dreamcatcher.  Whenever you query, it should be preloaded with the latest ideas in the whole realm.

## Privacy
AI can redact the text of data so that differential privacy can be offered for different classes of packets.  [The Redaction](https://app.edenai.run/bricks/text/anonymization) can link to chain objects that are used to replace the tokens with a chainId, or masked completely.

## AI QA
Packets can have their keywords automatically extracted, so the classification is not up to humans.
The meaning can be compared across all other packets and a distance calculated, with a number of routes.  Hopefully smaller packets can be suggested for extraction. https://app.edenai.run/bricks/text/keyword-extraction

## Examples
Given this piece of code with this git history, and these function inputs, how would you attribute what the caller paid to each developer ?  Why did you think that ?

Given this list of packets, write a blog post about what we are trying to achieve and what the benefits would be.
