## Diff presentation
Maybe there's room for a new kind of diff format that indicates an original text plus the LLM's expansion or markup of it that would include the prompt instructions that the LLM used in other settings like temperature etc plus show the meaningful end result difference with color codings for morphed words versus replaced or new words.

Then add in there the ability to show the diff with the source of other droplets, or synthetic derivations from droplets that were used to add further to the content to achieve some sort of overarching goal, like the creation of a packet for publication.

This allows attribution webs to be formed, where the relative value is appriased.  The price cannot be fixed, since this causes choking of information, but fair is what people want, and so the AI decides how much to charge, which may be different for each person, and then measures what is due for each document based on this provenance map.  This is crucial for the translucency of the [[Xanadu Principles]]
