There are some key files that need to be stored and updated by the LLM, as a way for it to take notes on what it is up to.  This is what a human would use an app for anyway, so it should be human readable and in plain text.

You would use the create file tool, and allow the file to be updated only when the appraiser thought it appropriate to do so.  The format of the file should be jsonschema, and it has a schema checker tool, to ensure the AI only made the correct updates, and was looped around if it did something strange.

Permissions to access a certain chain should be controlled by a guardian, that assesses what, but also why, and enters into the access log why you were granted access.  If the guardian sees you trying to change something that doesn't match why, then the PR gets rejected.

## Chain structure
If the AI can define schemas, and may be able to generate covenants with actual code in them, since it can write, run, observe, change, update, then the chain structure can be very light, but needs some base rules.

The simplification of app construction from blockchain makes it accessible to AI to generate some forms of useful code.
