Make a means of getting a record from an existing system.
also a little mechanism to check the status of the db, to know if the whole thing changed, or if a single record changed.
triggers to watch when that system changed so the AI knows when to make a new query or not.

AI can handle merge conflicts in data, so we can basically make the system of record be reduced to just a read only record that can eventually be halted and discarded.  All the old backups can be parsed and turfed if not needed any more.

gui will show the worksteps in a flowchart that the AI is going thru so you can see what its strategy is.
These strategy documents are strictly formatted so there cannot be errors in them, and the AI will get bounced back when it does something wrong.

AI generates a standard model of all data in the org by parsing it all.

Could we start making unreal engine models right in front of peoples eyes ?
Modify in 2D for the llm, and then do 3D tweaks by presenting different views.
