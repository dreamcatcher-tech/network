Generate images and stamp them all using AI.
Image stamper is the overlay function.
Generate the standard stamps using dalle3 and get a human to check them.
Then run the stamper to auto generate everything by running thru the AI models.

Preferrably the generation process would be baked into blockchain using the AI to code up the schemas and other things.  So ultimately the program itself was mutable using AI, and we are just running baked instances of this program.

Payload checker makes its own version from the src images and compares the pixels being exact.
The programming was a checklist that got run, where most steps can be done in parallel.

> **The baked program is the thing that gets published for further improvement by others**

It is a way of compression of the AI's work, so it only needs to be a little bit better next time.

It is first tested by using full AI to stand over the process until it is accepted as ok by the human.
Then the human plus the AI work to back it into code.
This iteration in code is then run thru the test suites and then released by an AI deciding when it is ok to publish.

Having an app store searchable by an AI, silently and guarnateed to be working on your behalf totally kill the advertising game - it really is about pure utility, since the AI won't be fooled.  Advertising relies on your inability to process data quickly, or to ignore some data.  Sponsored should mean the AI sees some benefit, in that it will receive rewards for using that vs another one, like free trial credits.

So the blockchain is the in which complex AI operations can be encoded in reliable ways to continue to keep the AI layer thin, otherwise there is a limit to how high the AI stack can sway in the breeze.
