Generate images and stamp them all using AI.
Image stamper is the overlay function.
Generate the standard stamps using dalle3 and get a human to check them.
Then run the stamper to auto generate everything by running thru the AI models.

Preferrably the generation process would be baked into blockchain using the AI to code up the schemas and other things.  So ultimately the program itself was mutable using AI, and we are just running baked instances of this program.

Payload checker makes its own version from the src images and compares the pixels being exact.
The programming was a checklist that got run, where most steps can be done in parallel.
