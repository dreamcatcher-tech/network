Can fine tune to output the dimensions of the display based on what a user said, and can teach them to manipulate the UI using prompts.

When the user wants to change something, and it is not clear, give them some examples and show them what the UI would now look like.

We can also analyze where customer queries were not what they thought, and start training the model further to respond as we expect.

Each prompt should be part of the embeddings naturally, and be found when searching for things you've said.
