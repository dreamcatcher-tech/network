Should allow for:
1. Payment of AI platform credits
2. Payment of QA fees
3. Funding of packets
4. Sponsoring of packets
5. Instant trading of any NFTs despite uncleared funds.


Uncleared funds should not stop trading, as the lien then sits with the funds paid, not with the NFT.  So someone with a credit card can purchase an NFT, then immediately sell it on, then when their cc payment clears, the DAI shows up in their account.

A credit card payment would go into a gateway fund, with a fee on top, then it would purchase crypto, but keep a lien on the funds.  If the QA had not been used, it would cancel the packet immediately.


If we control the transfer of the packets, then we can allow direct purchase using credit cards.

If the funding or buying is flagged as credit card, then it doesn't get dispersed until after the chargeback period, then things should be good.

The purchase with a credit card cannot be traded ?  Or can only be traded once a lien has been released on it.

We can provide the same power using a gateway company, where you send us cash and we will purchase platform credits for you.  But we will also maintain the quality of the spend, for a fee, so that we do not get in trouble with the purchasers.

Purchasing NFTs seems possibly using credit cards - you cannot purchase cryptocurrencies, but you  should be able to purchase NFTs.  Purchasing partcipation in a project.  Gives you project access, rights over the end result, and veto rights.

Purchasing platform credits which can be transitioned into funding for NFTs seems legitimate.

Should be doable by a standard co-owned token model, rather than anything special - it basically says the token is owned by two people at once, or that it is locked for transfer, or that it requires a flag to be lowered by the lender (who can also delete the token).

Make a pool where the credit card payments go in, with the other side of the pair being DAI, so we can provide a price for purchasing the DAI.  Gives us better liquidity, and a market can set the price for CC txns.  Different rates for different levels of KYC.  You can purchase risky CC purchases, but often when chargebacks occur there will be losses in gas fees.  Maybe do two purchases - gas purchase first.  The fact that the scammer gets nothing for their effort except wasting our gas fees should stop people.  We can however sell the funding cheap tho, if we want to get the cash back, or sell at market rate so we can recover our costs. 

QA payments can go thru a pool that charges more to cover the risk, so that on average, we also pay the QAs.
