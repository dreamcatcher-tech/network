Using the suite of network components from the [[Modelling Innovation as a Comms Network]] concept, we can make models of participants where each one is a pulsechain, and we can explore their interactions under different incentives and behaviours.

We can overlay this upon the real members that we have, and show the likely outcome of the network, whilst assigning a simplified model to each member based on their behaviour.  A simplified model means to assign them measurements for their amount of buffer, their switchiness, their packet rate, their incentive consumption rate, and their re-investment rate.

Using these models of our members, then we can forcast the future state of the network performance based on assumptions like growth rate and member behaviour changes.

Then we may incentivize some kinds of behaviours, or encourage behavioural change by showing its effect on the overall network metrics.
