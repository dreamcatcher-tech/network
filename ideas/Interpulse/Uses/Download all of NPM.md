I should be able to take a complete copy of the package repository, for my own use, but I should be able to share that and get paid each time someone pulls down from me.

I should be able to set whatever rate I like, and the payment can be in any currency I want.

The simplest currency is in download credits, where I get the promise that I can download X from the other party.  This credit can be rippled around thru trust networks.

Further dimensions to the request can be computed upon for value - needle in a hatstack factor, which is how big a dataset did I need to keep around just so the consumer could receive a small amount ?
