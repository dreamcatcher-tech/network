When Datums come in, they may have conflicts.  Being able to display these in an easy to understand way makes it easier than having some separate type of workflow to handle conflicts.

Since the datum displays are responsive, we could simply show conflicted pieces side by side, and down the middle have buttons to select which side you want to keep.

This becomes more complex in the event of N way merges, where there are many parties trying to converge on a single view.

This same display should be usable for history diffing as well.  In the history view, should be able to select different versions to be compared with each other, then indicate this connection by fattening the middle separator to indicate some intermediate versions have been tucked away behind this.

The ultimate is history with N way reconciliation.  If our GUI elements were capable of this out of the box, then we have a complete library.
