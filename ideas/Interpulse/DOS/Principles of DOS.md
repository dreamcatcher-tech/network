1.  Objects exist everywhere independent of any single computer because they are virtual,
     and not tied to a particular machine, freeing them from the faults of nature which p
    lague physical hardware
2.  Objects can connect to each other to transfer instructions or payload data via Links.
3.  The logic governing the behaviour of Objects is inside a Covenant
4.  A subclass of Covenant is a StateMachine
5.  In our system, Objects are only changed internally by StateMachines
6.  When viewed as a Graph, the Links between all Objects are the FileSystem
7.  The FileSystem is arranged in a hierarchy from a root, so that it looks like a POSIX
    filesystem for the familiarity of our users
8.  When viewed as executables, the collection of StateMachines are the Apps of our Dist
    ributedOperatingSystem 
9.  Including the App named the Dreamcatcher means we by default include the App that coo
    rdinates Talent into making more Apps
