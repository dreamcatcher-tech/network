Need utility such as:

> The platform package manager. Â Use list --installed
> to list all applications installed on the system.
> use list to show all available applications available for install.
> Use search to narrow down the list of available packages.
> Defaults to listing installed applications.

Problem is how to centralize the list of installed apps ?

Presume the only way is by making shell only allow apps to be installed at a specific location.
