Offer customized messages generated by chatgpt based on the customer notes on file, or some current events.

Let the people run tests by chatting with the interface as to what they want to appear.  They can try typing in the window to change text directly, but we might have to give them content boxes where they type in boxes and then refer to them in the layout view.
Let them upload images in the interface, and refer to them as content.  Lets them compose a library of other content they want to reuse from other places.

Send can automatically upload images to a CDN, optimize the images and test the sent emails.  It would loop with itself using its test email address until it got the right result that it wanted.

Let the customer define their own slugs in the emails, like a footer that has the current balance, next collection date, and other computed values.

Filter to select the customers is run by parsing each customer.
Each time gpt does a full customer walk, it should convert the query into something more general, and build up a layered index so it can use a query language next time.
