Make a chatgpt style interface to the system to answer queries and update customer records.

ask for changes, system summarizes what to do, asks your approval.

use an offline chatbot to work without an internet connection ?

Use chatbots adversarially to merge changes between systems ?

Listen in to phone conversations and start to pull up records based on what the customer is saying.  Then suggest things that the operator should say.  Ultimately, might be able to do away with the operator, or have the operator be purely text based ?

Have people watching conversations occur, watching what the machine is planning to say next, then getting involved when they see it going wrong.
