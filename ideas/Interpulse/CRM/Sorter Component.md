This seems exclusively tied to the geometry aspect of the CRM.

## Features
1. DND items to re-order them
2. Click on markers on the map in sequence to re-order them

### Sequencing
Select any item using the map or otherwise to have it move beneath the most recently selected item.  Highlight the currently selected item, then when moving the next one, maybe back shadow the previous selection ?
