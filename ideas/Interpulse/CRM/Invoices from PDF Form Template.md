If a PDF form is made, then we can populate that template with data relevant to the customer.

## Interface Options
Loading the template is always async.  Interface has to allow for that.
Sometimes we want to do a single invoice, other times all invoices, or a subset, or the invoices plus the runsheet for each Manifest.

### useInvoice()

## Uses

### With Manifest
1. Generate the manifest pdf as a standalone pdf
