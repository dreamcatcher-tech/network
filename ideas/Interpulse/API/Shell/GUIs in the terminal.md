Using [ink](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ink) it might be possible to make a UI for some applications directly in the GUI.  

If the CRM was built this way, then it could be run on the commandline too.

Probably more a novelty than anything else.

The [[Dreamcatcher App]] might benefit from this, since it is faster to make an app commandline first.
