Being able to control the shell of another engine by dispatching commands into it is quite important.

Relying on this might avoid needing a terminal based version of our system completely.

But a useful application would be the [[Shell Tunnel]]

Having this functionality early would make it easier to do client / server testing, as both server and client could be controlled from the browser shell.
