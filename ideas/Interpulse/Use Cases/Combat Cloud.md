As drone development continues and previous models of airborne control need to be further back from the fighting lines, the need for cooperative swarms of robotic machines slaved to a human arises sharply.

These swarms have a strong requirement for decentralized control, as they may be unable to communicate back to base, or may wish to maintain radio silence and only transmit to their peers.

There should be no central "server" vehicle as that presents a weak spot, the swarm should be able to transfer control to different human masters mid combat, and if one survives, the data relayed back to base should be the same as if all survived.

Such a swarm can be enabled with a blockchain based application, and we should be able to make a small demo showing this capability based on our architecture.  Demonstrating the architectural capabilities will help immensely in promoting the undertaking the work required to get the software up to combat level readiness.
