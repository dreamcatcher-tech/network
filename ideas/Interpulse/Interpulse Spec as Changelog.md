Each time a new feature is required, it usually gets written up in some kind of an [[Idea]]. These Ideas are debated over, refined, and ultimately implemented.  The chronological stream of these ideas and their implementation status can be used as a way to describe the current features of Interpulse, but also to define the work to be done.

Future projects can be pointed at different features so we know we are waiting on some capabilities to be able to attempt certain kinds of projects.  This can be our roadmap.

Changes can be separated out to infrastructure / blockchain changes, and application changes to a specific application.  That way, different types of application can be grouped by the features they need.
