Use tools like [SDFX](https://github.com/deadsy/sdfx) to model solids programmatically.
Permit massive forks with each instance being a dedicated fork.
Make a VR native and web native CAD program.
All modules within it are software based.
Acts like linux kernel where it can be easily packaged up in different ways.

Connect to a marketplace of making things and buying things that have already be made.

This would be a mainstay of the distributed supply chain model.

Every product would be distributed with access to its full cad models, evolution, and a marketplace for repair, resupply, and modifications.

Modification and deduplication are crucial to survival.  So is being able to build things locally and using substitutions.

Incorporating the process of production and distribution into the construction of the product.

Allow massive distributed programming using interpulse, so that ANSYS style FEA computations can be done on the public chain.  Sell private services that allow this to occur

Integrate any kind of quantum solver for doing spatial optimizations.
