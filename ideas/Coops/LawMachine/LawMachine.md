A SaaS app for Law as Xero is to Accounting.

## Features
### All lawyers calls recorded
These are available for you to listen to, and are transcribed.  Calls with you are optionally recorded, altho you can opt to go off record any time.

### Map all lawyers
We can already email all the lawyers at once since they are all mapped on the bar register.
Then we can scrape and check their corporate data and their websites, to get lists of them and their helpers and possibly their rates.  Then we can bulk email them all asking for help, see which ones give some of that help, and induct all their guidance into a central place to graphically represent your strategy options.

### Record your interactions with your lawyer
Use this as a secure whiteroom for yourself.  Invite your lawyer to join.  Or a compatible lawyer from the services directory, like xero.  Provides AI advice on documents, help with drafting, fact checks things, breaks out checks into blocks
