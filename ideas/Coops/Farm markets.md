Free software to track all data and management, which offers a marketplace for producers and suppliers that have compatible systems.  Takes a cut on the trade, without taking a cut internally.  The marketplace reduces switching costs between suppliers and increases reputation visibility, resulting in better performance of each purchasing dollar, even with our cut taken out.  The system compatibility assures the transition is seamless and comes with full provenance.

Target the drop of information at money exchange, to make the data easily flow between transactors.  Give in return easy information flow.

You must pay for hosting or else we won't provide it, but you can pay your own hosting.  If you use the public chain to host, then the software authors will get a cut of that.  If you self host, you are obliged to pay, but you don't have to.  When you trade on the marketplace, if you use our marketplace, you will be charged.
