Start with the governance system first.  Maybe make the governance app first ?
The AI attribution could be used to take a cut of all royalties gathered and attribute it back to the contributors to the platform.

Once have a billing relationship and a connection to the internal systems, add applications on top so people can easily do whatever they wanted to do together in this common safe space.

Royalties on trades seem the only type of governance power required - how many trades did you bring to the platform, and how many trades did the people you brought to the platform go on to gather ?  So founders seat is always open, and is performance based.

At some point, the governance gets frozen so that adding people comes with absolute certainty.

Can deploy a whole range of apps that are collaboration focused, so specifically designed to leverage the multiparty nature of the platform.  The data sharing and the software supply chain guarantees of these apps need to be extremely high, and guarantees they are running as intented with complete isolation needs to be assured.

Need some simulators for multiple parties coming to the table, and the trade growth each could stimulate.

The basis needs to be a good strong design for reconciliation between companies that is easily debugged, where each can have their own internal systems, but can rapidly negotiate with others be reconcile data of any format.

Then the first version of the trade reconciliation becomes an app on this larger platform.
