Start with the governance system first.  Maybe make the governance app first ?
The AI attribution could be used to take a cut of all royalties gathered and attribute it back to the contributors to the platform.

Once have a billing relationship and a connection to the internal systems, add applications on top so people can easily do whatever they wanted to do together in this common safe space.

Royalties on trades seem the only type of governance power required - how many trades did you bring to the platform, and how many trades did the people you brought to the platform go on to gather ?  So founders seat is always open, and is performance based.

At some point, the governance gets frozen so that adding people comes with absolute certainty.

Can deploy a whole range of apps that are collaboration focused, so specifically designed to leverage the multiparty nature of the platform.  The data sharing and the software supply chain guarantees of these apps need to be extremely high, and guarantees they are running as intented with complete isolation needs to be assured.

Need some simulators for multiple parties coming to the table, and the trade growth each could stimulate.

The basis needs to be a good strong design for reconciliation between companies that is easily debugged, where each can have their own internal systems, but can rapidly negotiate with others be reconcile data of any format.

Then the first version of the trade reconciliation becomes an app on this larger platform.

Charge for each shared block generated, and don't try tax what that block represents - if you're generating shared data with peers, you are getting value.  The more peers are in consensus, the more valuable things are.  So we'd be only charging for blocks generated of shared data.  Then services can be bolted on top of that.  So the data sharing is the primary thing, and can be for any shared data.  If you do not pay, you cannot generate shared data as your reputation is cut.

Payment included in the chain system, so the software, running correctly and with audits, determines who can access.  When each participant creates an app, some of the payments for usage go back to them, creating further incentive to pay their bills and encourage others to pay theirs.  The value is the audited images of the software, the integration with each partner, and the billing arrangements.

Makes a bus that has all the major players on it.  Then open up to external developers to make many different apps that take advantage of the shared data, but can guarantee each partner that the app is not leaking any of your data.

Be like the salesforce model, but between companies, not strictly internal like BP used salesforce apps for.

So any consortium model that was data focused, and likely romanticised about blockchain, is a place to make a shared apps platform, and use DreamcatcherAI to attribution to all the contributions.  Allows starting with the same model every time - one of pure contribution.  The network starts with governance using packets, and then people start specifying what they want and running pilots with each other.  The value is in being able to communicate with your partners better, and the fees extracted are small and designed to strengthen the quality of the network.  So stops any fears of being a prison since all transparent and focused on quality, which also stops the wasteland fears, since there is clearly sustaining revenue flowing in to the platform.

Partners can easily hire external services to manage all aspects of their connection to the network, which takes a cut that goes into the network pot.
