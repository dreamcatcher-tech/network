Method of allowing multiple different IT companies to work on your infrastructure at the same time.

Method of providing external QA for any work done.

Differential privacy to publish generic versions of your configuration for open scrutiny and advice on the system.

an IT company that specializes in maintaining a stable platform, and then allowing others to debate and compete to provide individual solution components the customer may require.

If we get an anchor tenant, like C, then use that to cover staff overheads, plus have the marketplace system in place to get work done competitively, we should be able to grow this business without a lot of struggle.  Particularly if the goal was to move all their systems over to our platform.

To be able to replace a whole IT support contract with software only and a remote worker marketplace.
May have some provisioning services where people courier devices away to, and we keep devices on standby locally.

The hardest part of the process was the email comms and the quote preparation - if this could be generated live, as well as the costings and checking all the details, plus nice ways to say and exclude problems, then life would be pretty easy.

So if something goes over budget, should switch to 50% billing or similar, since we would both be sharing the risk.  Having a marketplace for architectural appraisals helps.  Also bounty for best solution to problems.

Translate specific problems into anonymous problems so they can be published makes the marketplace return.  Making a marketplace for ideas, testing, bounty.

Incentives for lowing the cost of things down.  Incentives for improving business processes that impact bottom line.

Sign people up with the promise of eliminating IT support services, and show how we are incentivized to do that.  Our primary sale is Dreamcatcher apps, but we run services to ensure a good safe experience for all.  We help the transition, and we charge for the change, not the ongoing.  We expect reward when we lower overall costs.

We might be able to offer software solutions that are cheaper to use than buying hardware and support.  Custom solutions can be cheaper, provided they can be reliably maintained.  Using an open network of maintainers makes it easier and more likely to not lose support.  A closed source app will almost always give you trouble.  So a few use cases, like a large data storage service, would show that this is the case.  If we can find use cases that we can fund into bigger opportunities, then these business can benefit, and the it provider gets intro royalties.

Change control management - change control can be used as a project billing trigger - require people to submit their change control forms with a 2 week lead time, so everyone has fair warning.  No project is approved, no bills get paid, without change control attached and signed off.  Change control also triggers project fees, since it is officially something outside of BAU.  Investigating change should be costly, where a limit is placed around gaining signoff and the fees involved.  The submission should be publicised for 3rd party review.  The payment should be to refine this and pass all the automated checks, score well on the dashboards.

The pricing of the project should be part of the change control, rather than separate.
