If a decentralized islandwide attribution system was put in place, and lab based revenue can be reasonably expected, then we can raise funds for building the island out in anticipation of some of that future revenue.  This means no more bespoke deals need to be made that risk the fairness integrity of the island.

The Venture DAO acts like a single company to the world, but is made up of individual Ventures within it.  Scarce resources are managed here, and behaviour IO with the world is software regulated.  A tax is levied to keep the DAO and the island running, but that tax is algorithmic and is based on the decentralized attribution system.
