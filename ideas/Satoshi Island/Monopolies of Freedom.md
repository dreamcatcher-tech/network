## Monopolies of Freedom

The Networking infrastructure of the island provides a good example use case of several aspects that we might consider standardizing on the island.

## Starlink as a controlled resource

The number of starlinks on the island should be restricted, since the service quality and pricing of everyone elses starlink goes up with each added dish.  Because the spectrum is a resource that is limited in supply but that everyone needs, the usage should be centrally controlled by DAO vote.

Who should have what weighted say in the distribution of such a resource ?  We can immediately calculate a density funciton whereby we know how many starlinks can be permitted, and how close they can be to each other without causing interference, and without triggering price increases from Starlink the company.

The usage of a starlink should require that the access be shared with others for some reasonable price, since you are consuming a resource that only some of the island can use at once.

There should be no lock in to starlink per-se, but usage should be related to spectrum consumption.  It can also cover wifi terminals, since we shouldn't all run our own wifi networks as that degrades performance for neighbours.  Also creates a lot of cost for everyone, when if we all cooperated, we could roam the island with good internet from a local mesh network.

## NFT based management

Uptime guarantees - if you hold a starlink NFT, then you must have it online for some minimum term or else the license can be purchased off you.

Mint a selection of Starlink NFTs that give you the right to operate a starlink dish on the island, and earn revenues from selling its capacity to the island mesh network.  These NFTs should be able to be flash traded, as in the broadcast rights can be switched near instantly depending on who is operating, or in the case of failovers, so you can have your equipment ready and on standby if you want to mine redundancy, and the NFTs cycle around to prove uptime and share earnings.

A pool can be formed that provides capital to purchase equipment in exchange for a cut of the earnings from its usage.

This minting can be further granularized whereby some NFTs grant high quality voice channels.  You purchase them either ahead of time, or as needed, based on an auction, with the usage going to the highest bidder by some formula if you want to guarantee usage at a particular time - like booking further ahead is cheaper based on calculated price data that has occured already.

The mesh network of the island is where you use NFTs to purchase bandwidth as required, and sell it when you have it, while policing wifi pollution.  Means you can roam on the island with high grade low latency internet and only pay for what you use.

## Governance of Scarcity

Attribution was the founding motto of the USA - new attribution systems need new lands.

We should come up with a general formula for the management of scarce resources that allows a fair price to be set for sharing it, rewards those who invest in making the resource consumable by others, and incentivizes further innovations in the area.

What to do when other internet services become available ?  With a simple rules test - can everyone access it without degrading access for others - we can assert if the DAO should place rules over anything at all.  All scarce resources operate in two modes - saturated and sparse(?).  In sparse mode, whilst the resource is scarce, the load upon it is so small that conflict does not occur.

The same model can be applied to sound - soundwaves are a shared resource where the use by one person in one way affects the use by another person in another way.  Air pollution could be considered the same.  Localized affects can be incorporated in this model too, such as west cliff leeching sewage down the cliff that affects west coast.

The overall rule should always be user pays, and the funding mechanism should be pooling of funds, which investment in that pool can be traded freely.

The DAO should set the price and performance parameters, but anyone should be allowed to supply the service, allowing an automated switchability for consumers to find the path that best suits them.  Incentivize the infrastructure.  Rules are part of that incentivization, to limit supply and ensure investment returns.

## Extras
Due to the central control of the resource, a deal may be struck with Starlink themselves whereby the number of connections is agreed upon and a discounted rate struck - this is a benefit of central control, is central purchasing power.
