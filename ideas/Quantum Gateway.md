Use the Interpulse API as a means of interacting with quantum  as a service providers, such as https://www.xanadu.ai/ we can make programmers lives easier, gain popularity for our platform, and make Dreamcatcher apps have quantum abilities easily bolted on.

Dreamcatcher is well suited to be to quantum computing like npm was for nodejs, because a central compatible place is hard, people want to write in many different languages but have them all work together, and almost nobody has their own quantum computer so they have to access them over the network in paid time slices.

## Shared Burden
Quantum space being quite new, the demand for people to solve problems in the space is high, and the connection between people is low.  Dreamcatcher specializes in these conditions, and enables people who have a problem to find people who can solve it, whilst allowing deduplication.

Hopefully this ability to find people with similar problems lowers the price enough that Dreamcatcher becomes a popular place to go to have your quantum computing problems solved.

## Verification
Did this magical cutting edge computer actually compute correctly ?  By making the problems be submitted in a publicized form, we can allow conventional computing to tackle the same problem and report back the results.

Pools can be set up that skim each transaction and pay out a prize if someone can demonstrate that a quantum computer gave an incorrect result.

## Quantum API
All the quantum computers have a slightly different type of api.  We could start to evolve one that was a defacto standard, so if you write your program to target this API, then you have access to a large number of quantum services, and can switch between them rapidly based on market pricing.

Importantly, the Dreamcatchers ability to identify what type of API is required, and for people to fund its construction, means that it can more rapidly evolve.  This should hopefully result in many libraries being published using our platform, helping growth.

## Proof of Work support
One of the principles of our public chain is that any act of labour or act of trust can be used as an assertive weight to help support what the 'correct' top level public chain is.  Actions such as git commits, or publishing of popular libraries are all an opportunity to assert the hash of the latest block, adding to a web of trust that people can use to quickly find what 'latest' means.

Each quantum calculation can be used in this manner too, providing a proof that a calculation occured that has some quantum cost and a corresponding classical cost, which supports some notion of 'latest' for the public chain.

Depending on the calculations, we may be able to insert the proofs directly into the computation, rather than it being an assertion, like a protein folding puzzle, or some other useful work that is hard to solve, but quick to verify.
