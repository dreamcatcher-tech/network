In some countries, regulation is low.  Political change may make conditions favourable to the launch of a new stockmarket.

Eg: in Ukraine, launching a stockmarket to allow international funds to flow in to finance public private partnership agreements.  This would be venture grade, and could be used as a way for even small companies in Ukraine to raise funds.

The emphasis would be on transparency of operation, and should allow listers to easily merge and fork, fostering collaboration over competition.

It would tie directly into the Dreamcatcher, which listers could use for staff advertisements and contract management.

If the stockmarket was based on the Ethereum blockchain and the UA govt granted rights to the shareholders, the same as a regular stockmarket, then we could start to operate unencumbered in the country.  The regulation would be to ensure the companies used the reporting software to make timely disclosures.
