We have found a company that is about to fold.  It has about 20 shareholders.  One key shareholder and some key staff want to do a phoenix move.  They want to use the Dreamcatcher to write software with.  There may be a way to roll up their shareholding requirements into shares in Dreamcatcher Inc.

Basically if you put work thru us, you receive some amount of shares equal to the money you put in or some simple method.  Your primary benefit is getting your work done - shares are a bonus, but they help us get to listing. Plus we can be very clear about our listing aims.

If you fund any projects and complete the ID requirements and actually pay out QA'd work, then you can have shares issued to you.  You might as well since you're not losing anything and the Securities Guardian allows it.

Once public we can issue stock in line with the DRE algorithm.  We can also issue shares to ourselves to keep the balance the same ?  All shareholders get issued more shares whenever anyone puts money in, so that the original ratios stay the same.  If you are later, then you issued less shares.  Earlier you are, the more you get issued.

There is no direct funding of the company, only funding of packets.
