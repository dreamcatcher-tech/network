CSE operates a lost cost stockmarket in Canada that has good listing access, and appears to be reasonable about their listing requirements.

## 150 Shareholders

To get to the requisite 150 shareholders that the CSE requires, we could offer people who purchase work from us the option to become a shareholder with the fees that would otherwise be our profit.  So we would pay all our costs for a job, and the amount left over for the dreamcatcher would be available to be made as an investment.  Having automated cap table management, this would be presented as part of the normal payment flow.    

This advertises our stock offering, and avoids needing to be an accredited investor as the investor would be part of the [[BFF]] group.  Funders putting their money in would be presented with a 'purchse stock' option that is grayed out until they become part of the BFF group.  

Workers could have this option to purchase shares when they cash their funds out.  As part of the [[BFF]] group, they would be allowed to trade money for being a shareholder.

We can enable trading between the [[BFF]] group for those who want to exit their investment.  If the funds have not been used for anything, they can withdraw at the current price.  We would set a runrate proportional to the funds in the bank, so that people could always withdraw.  They could also set a min price, and the next person to purchase shares would be a combination of trade and issuance.

## Investing vs shareholding
Investing is taking funds and giving them us to do with as we see fit in pursuit of some agreed common goal.  If people want to do this with us, then we should let them, so long as they pass the securities guardian requirement.  These types of shares might not trigger an issue out to everyone else, or they might only trigger a share payout upon completion.

The general public would be invited to purchase some of the rolled up asset formed by all the royalty streams retained by the company.

## Taxation

If we earn funds, we would pay tax on it.  If customers instead became shareholders, we can invest the money from them before we get taxed before it, gaining us extra funds.
