>[!question] Targets: [[Request for Public Company]]

>[!danger] Depends: 

CSE operates a lost cost stockmarket in Canada that has good listing access, and appears to be reasonable about their listing requirements.
Public companies have transparency requirements, and an inherent amount of trust due to their regulated nature.  They have good access to capital and their stock holders enjoy instant liquidity to buy in or out.

The operating model of the Dreamcatcher is well suited to a public company structure, so long as that public company is an actor within the network and is never permitted to gain any kind of control over the protocol.

As a registered issuer this company could engage in the promotion of its stock where its stock acted as a proxy to [[Packets]] that were built to support the Dreamcatcher. 

We would like to get a valuation on our crypto assets, and also have a way of raising capital to produce more such assets.  We can periodically disperse those assets that have become legitimate securities or that are decentralized enough, amongst the shareholders, which would greatly decrease the stock price, periodically.

Possibly Australia might be a good listing jurisdiction, as they have much mining exploration like Canada, and the capital gains exemption does not require switching country.

It is important to separate the top level management effort from the pubco, since the pubco would be taking on liability if it was in control of the project - it is simply a powerful peer of the network.  Pubcos are terrified of liability, and decentralized projects are terrified of control.

## 150 Shareholders

To get to the requisite 150 shareholders that the CSE requires, we could offer people who purchase work from us the option to become a shareholder with the fees that would otherwise be our profit.  So we would pay all our costs for a job, and the amount left over for the dreamcatcher would be available to be made as an investment.  Having automated cap table management, this would be presented as part of the normal payment flow.    

This advertises our stock offering, and avoids needing to be an accredited investor as the investor would be part of the [[BFF]] group.  Funders putting their money in would be presented with a 'purchase stock' option that is grayed out until they become part of the BFF group.  

Workers could have this option to purchase shares when they cash their funds out.  As part of the [[BFF]] group, they would be allowed to trade money for being a shareholder.

We can enable trading between the [[BFF]] group for those who want to exit their investment.  If the funds have not been used for anything, they can withdraw at the current price.  We would set a runrate proportional to the funds in the bank, so that people could always withdraw.  They could also set a min price, and the next person to purchase shares would be a combination of trade and issuance.  Also if you send your shares to a gateway holder, then we can let you trade it within the network.

We would like to list our social network on the public stock exchange, and we can set up the project plan by which to do that.  It would have AI generated press releases to ensure compliance of relevant information is available.  But, fundamentally, the operations of the network are not the same as the company - the company is an active participant in the network.  Things relevant to the company need to be published, but the network changes just like the environment of a mining company changes.  So we would find investors and partners who do business with us that want to put in money to be a shareholder.  Once we hit our listing requirements, we start the process.

We could offer to do work for companies, where the money they pay in is an investment rather than a payment for services.  Since we are working with them closely, accreditation does not apply.  We would have taken their payment and turned it into investment anyway, so why not have them on the register.  Get their staff in there too, provided they are participating in building the system.  People who participate in the system and like it will likely hold their stock, so we want those members, since they won't just dump the stock.  We can link their shares to specific NFTs that we collaborated on.

We can allow stock participation if you cash in some of your NFTs, so we can allow just NFT generated members to participate, since you clearly understand what's going on, and have done work.
## Investing vs shareholding
Investing is taking funds and giving them us to do with as we see fit in pursuit of some agreed common goal.  If people want to do this with us, then we should let them, so long as they pass the securities guardian requirement.  These types of shares might not trigger an issue out to everyone else, or they might only trigger a share payout upon completion.

The general public would be invited to purchase some of the rolled up asset formed by all the royalty streams retained by the company.

## Taxation

If we earn funds, we would pay tax on it.  If customers instead became shareholders, we can invest the money from them before we get taxed before it, gaining us extra funds.

## V1 NFT basis
To raise public funds to build the Dreamcatcher without corrupting the protocol requires an interface to be designed.  That interface can be a public company that raises funds controlled by us to fund packets on behalf of people who want a 3rd party to do the effort and gain a profit from it.  This seems a quick and easy way to get funding to tackle more exotic routes, like starting our own exchange in UA.

150 shareholders can be found by creating an app that lets people register interest, and store funds in commitment of, the formation of a public company.  Once we have this requisite amount, we can incorporate, register as an issuer in canada or australia, convert the NFT escrow commits into share certificates.
This whole work can be described as a packet and can be funded by seeders.

Then we open a gateway for the shares to be minted for NFTs so they can be blockchain traded.  This allows the smoothing pool to be set up also.

NFTs can start by being OpenSea listed using the OpenSea API for packets of work, then applying QA to the funders.  Funders must prove they have a utility for the code which will bring in revenue for all participants, and / or they must prove participation.  Participation as in selecting which packets to fund, and selecting whether to release the funds or not is sufficient, but extra proof can be found in requiring a github account with some contribution metrics, to prove they know about the domain.  Reselling the NFT is only allowed if multiple independent parties are generating income from this packet.

Mint the NFTs using an ERC1155 contract or similar, then mutate the properties of each token as the packet becomes available.  So we mint a new NFT once we know the base chain of the packet.  This means we can tap the crypto funding sources, and beautiful interfaces they have developed.

The utility of having a publicly hosted chain is better than having some short term income.  Making a PoA hosted services provider so that demo based projects can be built upon is powerful.  Particularly if the first hosted app is the Dreamcatcher work management app, so that packets can be openly bidded upon.  This means we can see our hourly rate go up as demand for our services goes up due to surge pricing.

## Offerings
We would have a working piece of software and so when we are introduced to companies around london, like we used to be, then we can start projects where we can demonstrate our utility, and we can sign contracts with them as a company to deliver and maintain services to them.  These pilots can be taking place rapidly, using our development model, and the sales meetings themselves can leave working software behind.  These news articles, particularly with new sales being announced regularly, should be surprisingly novel inside the blockchain and AI industry.

The pubco would handle the contractual obligations, process payments and turn them into NFT escrows.  We would be a peer on the network, not a controller of the network.  We would maintain the realworld relationships and process the funds.  We would perform dilligence on the contractors we pay and the customers we sell to.

There is still no system that offers the features we want, of repeatable computation at scale.  No blockchains offer any kind of computed fairness system.  No microtransaction system can handle royalties for every contribution to some knowledge work.
