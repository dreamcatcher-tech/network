Public companies have transparency requirements, and an inherent amount of trust due to their regulated nature.  They have good access to capital and their stock holders enjoy instant liquidity to buy in or out.

The operating model of the Dreamcatcher is well suited to a public company structure, so long as that public company is an actor within the network and is never permitted to gain any kind of control over the protocol.

To get to the requisite 150 shareholders that the CSE requires, we could offer people who purchase work from us the option to become a shareholder with the fees that would otherwise be our profit.  So we would pay all our costs for a job, and the amount left over for the dreamcatcher would be available to be made as an investment.  Having automated cap table management, this would be presented as part of the normal payment flow.

Workers could have this option to purchase shares when they cash their funds out.  As part of the [[BFF]] group, they would be allowed to trade money for being a shareholder.

We would set a runrate proportional to the funds in the bank, so that people could always withdraw.  They could also set a min price, and the next person to purchase shares would be a combination of trade and issuance.
