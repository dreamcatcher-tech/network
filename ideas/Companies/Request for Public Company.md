Public companies have transparency requirements, and an inherent amount of trust due to their regulated nature.  They have good access to capital and their stock holders enjoy instant liquidity to buy in or out.

The operating model of the Dreamcatcher is well suited to a public company structure, so long as that public company is an actor within the network and is never permitted to gain any kind of control over the protocol.

As a registered issuer this company could engage in the promotion of its stock where its stock acted as a proxy to [[Packets]] that were built to support the Dreamcatcher, or even start [[Issuing Packets as shares]] directly.

Because a packet switched network must be resilient to failures of many nodes, the public company cannot hold any critical-to-function position in the network.  It must be demonstratable and believable that the network would survive without the public company, and that even if that company turned hostile, the network would continue on unihibited, with the only loss being that of capacity.
