Public companies have transparency requirements, and an inherent amount of trust due to their regulated nature.  They have good access to capital and their stock holders enjoy instant liquidity to buy in or out.

The operating model of the Dreamcatcher is well suited to a public company structure, so long as that public company is an actor within the network and is never permitted to gain any kind of control over the protocol.

As a registered issuer this company could engage in the promotion of its stock where its stock acted as a proxy to [[Packets]] that were built to support the Dreamcatcher, or even start [[Issuing Packets as shares]] directly.

Because a packet switched network must be resilient to failures of many nodes, the public company cannot hold any critical-to-function position in the network.  It must be demonstratable and believable that the network would survive without the public company, and that even if that company turned hostile, the network would continue on unihibited, with the only loss being that of capacity.

Everywhere we go where we promote our system to attract users, we are in the same breath promoting the public company, for people who like the idea but don't know how to make money from within it, so they just want to give us their money.

Being able to now generate promotional videos and other content using AI means our operating costs should be tiny.  No more huge bills for content creation.  Simple accounting costs.  Every service we need, we find someone willing to operate in an AI amplified way, and we launch a business that applies their skill using computers, saving us money, earning us and them money, growing our footprint.

If we make all the advice we receive transparent and anonymized, then we can work towards meeting any regulatory requirements for our company.  We can also figure out what the fair value of shareholdings are in the company, based on our attribution tooling.  We can make these tools available to other companies, where we can charge them for its usage by calculating what they owe us using the attribution tooling we make.  Means we can weather all the regulatory burdens of the pubco intelligently, and always be growing our knowledge base.

Attribution calculation is our primary offering, and we should use it internally.

As soon as we can use Dreamcatcher to make bots to solve any task, then we should start operating a company, so we don't waste time on all the admin overheads.  Whenever a problem occurs, we just generate a bot solution.  Once we live in this dreamland, we can take on the public company task as a way of generating publicity, funding, and capital gains, where we are trading the future success of our venture to cover our losses over the past 5 years.

Key is to make the value we are reversing in be the NFTs that have been created, and the expenditures will be to fund these NFTs.  We would reinvest all profits, and use tax credits in the company.  These assets would 

Listing in the US might not be so burdensome since we have a compliance meeting machine.
