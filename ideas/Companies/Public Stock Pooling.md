Much as DeFi pioneered pooling, we should be able to supply the same service on a registered stock exchange platform.

Holders of our stock should be able to stake the stock and some funds so that some algorithmically determined target price was followed.  Raw DeFi does not influence the price paid, but our pooling would target long term growth and short term stability of our stock.

In exchange for placing their stock and their funds in this pool, stakers would earn a small portion of each trade as their fee.  They could reinvest this, or withdraw it.  This would present a way for founders to earn "interest" on their holdings without selling short the company.

The transparent and algorithmic operation of this pool would mean that trust could be established as to the pricing of the stock.  Stakers could lock in their stock for long periods to further stabilize the marketplace.

A connector service exists that makes trades using an automated platform such as IBKR, and an escrow service can be set up so the service providers can only be trusted with as much as they have escrowed, to ensure low trust requirements of operation.
