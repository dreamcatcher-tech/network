Working on complex machinery in a componentized manner is far better.
Making those components as independent of each other as possible is better for quality and speed, as each one is free to improve independently.

Why then are the components still worked on in closed groups ?  If they were opened up to a wider pool, we can have better ideas cheaper, and increase the chance of reuse, lowering costs  even further.

In the Dreamcatcher, each component comes with a development network attached, that can improve it, fund it, attribute to you for it, and even obsolete it with something better.
