Competition is wasteful if two distinct instances of a system that performs the same function compete with each other in the same resource space.

When the earths resources were plentiful compared to the demands on those resources, this form of competition accelerated growth.  In the new age of careful conservation this model cannot survive unbridled.

Competition should be incentivized to occur between the system components, and to be a system component, not in the systems themselves.

## The War of the Sky
The most breathtaking example is the coming facility based competition betwen [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/) and [OneWeb](https://oneweb.net/) where two facilities for space based internet will orbit above customers of both.  How this should have gone is that anyone can launch a satellite based on some protocol specifications for where, when, comms, and other details, and then consumers can select on the fly which hardware to operate on in an open realtime market, switching in sub millisecond speed for whichever combination of offerings suits them best at that instant.

Instead, both systems will compete for radio spectrum availability, disadvantaging all customers, extra capacity on each will not be available to the others, and ultimately one will fail over time, leading to complete waste.  This uncooperative behaviour is for animals to establish strong genes, but for the vast capabilities of humans this should be programmed out in favour of cooperation for a common goal - cheap reliable sustainable and profitably delivered internet for all.

Facility based competition is a type that requires huge switching cost, and huge cost for competitors to enter.  This is market supressing.  The faster the switching time, and the lower the cost of entry as a component of a wider system, the truer the market pricing.

## Meanwhile on the ground
Cooperation between subscribers would further enhance the experience of all.  One starlink terminal could supply the needs of 20 homes if the cooperated well.  Instead, facility competition only earns from each household being isolated from the other and going thru the facility they own.
