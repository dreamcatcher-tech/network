In terms of component count, there is no larger machine than the internet.  Oxford dictionary defines a machine as:

> a piece of equipment with many parts that work together to do a particular task.

By this definition, the internet is the largest machine ever built, and has the widest reach in terms of people served.

This machine has a problem: because its commercial models were out of band, and not intrinsically part of the machine,  a corruption is woven in to the very existence of the greatest information retrieval system ever built:

> ask for information X, get X + Y, where Y is unwanted information in the form of advertising
