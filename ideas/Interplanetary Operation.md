Ethereum probably couldn’t survive relativistic effects because it needs to be so absolute about it’s timeline.

So we should make a simulation that includes earth to mars light transmission time, and also interuptions to communications and show how a blockchain with nodes on both planets can still reach consensus using our design.

This should be contrasted to Ethereum's design where no blocks could ever be mined on mars due to time delays.  Shared state is not possible - only dictatorial state where Earth tells Mars what the blockchain is.
