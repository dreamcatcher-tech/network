alt="Anime-Beautiful_DreamcatcherAlgorithmicCapTable" src="/assets/images/R01-d6fa0de504226a2ea644c8f86230c09e.png" width="256" height="256" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The traditional incentives for innovating are mis-aligned. This creates friction and in turn hampers the speed of Innovation. For example, typically:</p><ol><li>A Cap Table will be drawn up for the main benefit for investors, incentivising them to minimise the cost of their holding and maximise share value of dividends.</li><li>Wages are agreed ahead of any work being done, incentivising workers to minimise the effort needed to maintain or increase that wage, and to horde their own ideas for individual benefit.</li><li>Inventors are incentivised to control their inventions for fear of losing out to others, e.g. with Patents, or to open up their work and seek other, secondary, forms of reward, e.g. as happens with open source where the purity of purpose is tainted.</li><li>Customers with valuable problems to solve either accept the compromise of off-the-shelf solutions, horde bespoke software for fear of losing the relative benefit with their competitors, and attempt to minimise their costs for both.</li></ol><p>In each case, each actor sees the optimisation of their own returns as a zero-sum game with one or more of the other actors. Moreover, their actions are optimised for the local maxima of their own return, despite there very possibly being a higher return available as a share of the returns should the Innovation be used <em>to its full potential</em>. We believe that their own return at global maxima is higher than at their local maxima.</p><p>We believe that this is due to the practice of having to agree ahead of time what the relative Dispersal of benefits from the Innovation will be, and the fear that the benefit of the actual Contribution each actor makes may go elsewhere. Not only does this waste time and energy when the actual value is unknown, it restricts all from putting in the full measure of the effort that they believe the idea deserves.</p><p>No one can possibly know with certainty the value of that any particular Contribution will make.</p><p>Our intent is to solve this inefficiency by creating an Algorithmic Cap Table, where all Contributions are recorded, and where the benefits of the Innovations produced are distributed fairly and transparently based on those Contributions once there impact is actually known. We intend to do this by putting in a system of proof of ownership at a granular level and generating that Cap Table on the fly for each distribution of benefits that arise from the product or products that the Contribution was used in.</p><p>We expect, when this problem is solved, that the result will be a highly efficient and attractive Innovation environment that will outcompete traditional Innovation in terms of speed to market and the financial returns on the time and money employed.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tactical-intent">Tactical Intent<a class="hash-link" href="#tactical-intent" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h2><p>We assume that, given the likely granularity and fidelity required, the Strategic Intent is best met by building an App on <a href="https://github.com/dreamcatcher-tech/dreamcatcher-tech.github.io/blob/master/website/nfas/Requests/R06.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Interblock</a> so it inherits Interblock&#x27;s capabilities to provide a trusted, distributed, granular system. This App would have the following properties:</p><ol><li>A method of allowing all Contributions to be recorded. I.e what was done by whom and who provided what by providing proof of ownership to that Contribution, including trading of that proof of ownership.</li><li>A method of assessing what the relative impact of each individual Contribution, including additional improvements as they are made over time.</li><li>A method that records the on-going financial value the Innovation generates for as long as it is used.</li><li>A method that assures Dispersal of those benefits as they become available to those who hold the proof of ownership, including any benefits arising from the sale of rights or ultimate ownership.</li><li>Intrinsically and actively maintains the confidence of all Users.</li><li>Contains within its structure the ability to change and adapt when improvements that better meet the Strategic Intent are identified.</li><li>A method of self governance that allows Users of the System to enter into agreements with other Users that algorithmically control parts of the System through a Contract, without the capacity to override any of the above Tactical Intents.</li><li>A method of publishing and advertising of problems and solutions to those problems, and Contracting between the two.</li><li>A method to publish and provide solutions which do not refer directly to published problems, but which can still be used by others with benefits arrising. This is expected to need the provision of an extension of the base license with detailed license conditions.</li><li>A method of negotiating contracts or providing licenses for:<ol><li>The use of solutions within other solutions (ie nesting)</li><li>The use of solutions to meet or partly meet problems.</li><li>The execution of solutions not yet created to meet the needs of problems.</li></ol></li><li>A marketplace in which proofs of ownership can be traded after-market.</li><li>A method to provide capital in a pool, with governance agreed and enforced algorithmically, and for the use of that capital to either purchase proofs of ownership in existing solutions or to fund the development of solutions that do not yet exist. This capital pool will require integration with the contracting function and therefore with problem, solution, development, QA, publication, escrow, dispersal and reuse/improvement.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="definition-of-done">Definition of Done<a class="hash-link" href="#definition-of-done" title="Direct link to heading">â€‹</a></h3><ol><li><p>We will know that this is done when the first 3 projects are set up and running, choosing this System over the traditional System on purely Smithian Rational Agent grounds.
